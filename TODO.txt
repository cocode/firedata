# TODO Rearrange project structure
    - Separate fetching code from computing code, from display (print, html) code.
        - Done for get_cal_fire_data, still need to do for US and WA.
        - Make same changes to get_us_fire_data that were made to get_cal_fire_data.
        - Make same changes to get_wa_fire_data that were made to get_cal_fire_data.
# TODO Timestamp the data downloaded (currently I just save YYYYMMDD, not time)
# TODO Graph for delta acres burned in html
# TODO Bring non-calfire sources up to parity with calfire.
# TODO Only rebuild the webpage if we get new data from calfire
# TODO github action fails if no changes since last run, as commit returns 1
# TODO Chart this year vs last year on daily chart.
# TODO Allow user to select year to display.
# TODO for federal data, I'm only collecting california. I should get all states, and save it.
# TODO Make fetching from the different sources independent jobs. If WA fails, we shouldn't fail CA or US
# TODO Add tests, and add test workflow.
    - Test workflow working.
    - Need more tests.
# TODO We load the data for the fires several times. Each function loads the data again. Fix that.
# TODO The calfire summary should print the two dates it is comparing
# TODO Convert the historical data chart to a stacked bar chart, and include all agencies.
    - Have state & federal, not local yet.
# TODO Find a better way to add a footnote to a google chart.
# TODO How to display US & Cal fire data. Always on one stacked bar chart? One page for each?
# TODO Get the chart data from .json, in create_webpage_multi, to make chart fully specified by json.
# TODO Getting the most recent to downloaded data points should be moved to the data store, for efficiency.
# TODO When creating the webpage, split the "load" and "format for JavaScript" parts of the functionss.
# TODO Precompute the acres burned per day for US fire data. Do it on download? Need previous day's data to do this.
# TODO Check that historical us computations are correct. I see a -37 on 2021/06/16. Possible it's in the data.
# TODO Check to see if reruning collect is overwriting the existing version. My local copies are getting updated.
# TODO Fetching washington data has been failing, but works locally. Fix it.
# TODO File dates are off by one. The fetch during evening of the 19th is getting saved as the 20. Perhaps a GMT issue.
# TODO There is an XML source for WA fire data, which should be much easier to parse. See xmldict
# TODO get_annual_acres takes a data source and a year, but data source also takes a year. Don't need both.
# TODO Rename "summarize" to "get_daily_delta", which is clearer.
# TODO Backfill data from archive.org
# TODO When calculating us fire data, we don't get a total, we have to compute it by deltas between days
      - for annual graphs, we really need the last data point in the previous year to be our starting point
      - for computing deltas, otherwise the first day will show a huge boost of fires.
