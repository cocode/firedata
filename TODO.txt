# TODO Rearrange project structure
# TODO Separate fetching code from display (print, html) code.
# TODO Timestamp the data downloaded (currently I just save YYYYMMDD, not time)
# TODO Graph for delta acres burned in html
# TODO Bring non-calfire sources up to parity with calfire.
# TODO Only rebuild the webpage if we get new data from calfire
# TODO Chart this year vs last year.
# TODO Allow user to select year to display.
# TODO for federal data, I'm only collecting california. I should get all states, and save it.
# TODO Make fetching from the different sources independent jobs. If WA fails, we shouldn't fail CA or US
# TODO Add tests, and add test workflow.
# TODO We load the data for the fires several times. Each function loads the data again. Fix that.
# TODO Need to make year handling consistent. Sometimes we default to current year, sometimes pass it.
# TODO The calfire summary should print the two dates it is comparing
# TODO Convert the historical data chart to a stacked bar chart, and include all agencies.
# TODO Should just reformat the historial data once, and check it in.
