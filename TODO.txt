# TODO Rearrange project structure
    - Separate fetching code from computing code, from display (print, html) code.
        - Done for get_cal_fire_data, still need to do for US and WA.
# TODO Timestamp the data downloaded (currently I just save YYYYMMDD, not time)
# TODO Graph for delta acres burned in html
# TODO Bring non-calfire sources up to parity with calfire.
# TODO Only rebuild the webpage if we get new data from calfire
# TODO github action fails if no changes since last run, as commit returns 1
# TODO Chart this year vs last year on daily chart.
# TODO Allow user to select year to display.
# TODO for federal data, I'm only collecting california. I should get all states, and save it.
# TODO Make fetching from the different sources independent jobs. If WA fails, we shouldn't fail CA or US
# TODO Add tests, and add test workflow.
    - Test workflow working.
    - Need more tests.
# TODO We load the data for the fires several times. Each function loads the data again. Fix that.
# TODO The calfire summary should print the two dates it is comparing
# TODO Convert the historical data chart to a stacked bar chart, and include all agencies.
    - Have state & federal, not local yet.
# TODO Find a better way to add a footnote to a google chart.
# TODO How to display US & Cal fire data. Always on one stacked bar chart? One page for each?
# TODO: Get the chart data from .json, in create_webpage_multi, to make chart fully specified by json.
