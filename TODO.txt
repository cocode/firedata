# TODO Cal Fire chart is suposed to be cumulative, but it's going down.
# TODO Working on getting docker image to run branch code coverage tests. Should also export artifacts.
# TODO merges might be less annoying if the webpages were in a different project, which this project generated.
#   Or just write them to a different directory, like tmp. Or could check it into a web display project.
#   Keep the fetch and parse code in one project, and webpages in a dedicated project.
# TODO make a code coverage github action.
# TODO Have a "non-checkin" parameter on the fetch job, so I can test the action, without checking in the results
# TODO Rearrange project structure
    - Separate fetching code from computing code, from display (print, html) code.
        - Done for get_cal_fire_data, still need to do for US and WA.
        - Make same changes to get_us_fire_data that were made to get_cal_fire_data.
        - Make same changes to get_wa_fire_data that were made to get_cal_fire_data.
# TODO Timestamp the data downloaded (currently I just save YYYYMMDD, not time)
# TODO Graph for delta acres burned in html
# TODO Bring non-calfire sources up to parity with calfire.
# TODO Only rebuild the webpage if we get new data
# TODO github action fails if no changes since last run, as commit returns 1. Fix.
# TODO Chart this year vs last year on daily chart.
# TODO Allow user to select year to display.
# TODO Make fetching from the different sources independent jobs. If WA fails, we shouldn't fail CA or US
#     - One job per source, to fetch data
#     - One job to build the webpage (only rebuild if things have changed)
# TODO Add more tests.
# TODO We load the data for the fires several times. Each function loads the data again. Fix that.
# TODO The calfire summary should print the two dates it is comparing
# TODO Convert the historical data chart to a stacked bar chart, and include all agencies.
    - Have state & federal, not local yet.
# TODO Find a better way to add a footnote to a google chart.
# TODO How to display US & Cal fire data. Always on one stacked bar chart? One page for each?
# TODO Get the chart data from .json, in create_webpage_multi, to make chart fully specified by json.
# TODO Getting the most recent to downloaded data points should be moved to the data store, for efficiency.
# TODO When creating the webpage, split the "load" and "format for JavaScript" parts of the functionss.
# TODO Precompute the acres burned per day for US fire data. Do it on download? Need previous day's data to do this.
# TODO Check that historical us computations are correct. I see a -37 on 2021/06/16. Possible it's in the data.
# TODO Check to see if reruning collect is overwriting the existing version. My local copies are getting updated.
# TODO Fetching washington data has been failing, but works locally. Fix it.
# TODO File dates are off by one. The fetch during evening of the 19th is getting saved as the 20. Perhaps a GMT issue.
# TODO There is an XML source for WA fire data, which should be much easier to parse. See xmldict
# TODO get_annual_acres takes a data source and a year, but data source also takes a year. Don't need both.
# TODO Rename "summarize" to "get_daily_delta", which is clearer.
# TODO Backfill data from archive.org
# TODO When calculating us fire data, we don't get a total, we have to compute it by deltas between days
      - for annual graphs, we really need the last data point in the previous year to be our starting point
      - for computing deltas, otherwise the first day will show a huge boost of fires.
      - Can't do this by year, in case we start the graphs on may 1 (well, if we go through the whole year, it's ok)
# TODO Create charts for each state, with only federal chart data, if we don't have a state getter
# TODO create federal history graph (add it to california and generic states) federal_fire_history.txt, I think
# TODO Display number of active fires for each state.
# It's a but odd that california leads with calfire chart, while every other state leads with federal, as that's all they have
    - it makes it not comparable, when you switch from one state to the next.
# TODO Starting the webpage at other than january 1 is incompatible with the federal was of calculating deltas. See TODO in get_us_fire_data
# TODO Add local data to california fire data.
# TODO replace negative burn days with zero. It makes the graphs look better, and negative burns are not meaningful.
    - Negative burn days happen with the revise the estimate for a fire's size. (I think).
# TODO Why does running coverage on a mac include "wayback.py" and "print_cal_fire_data.py" when they
#   - are ignored on the docker run of coverage
# TODO Bug: if there is only one data point in a year, the setting of the starting date to january 1 does not work,
    - add a second point, and it does.
