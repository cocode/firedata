<br />
John Day, OR – Today, the Black Butte Fire transfers command from Northwest Team 9 to Northwest Team 6.  <br />
Both groups are Type 2 Incident Management Teams.  The incident objectives had some slight changes.  Fire <br />
operations will continue to focus on firefighter and public safety, basing strategies and tactics on sound risk <br />
management.   <br />
<br />
There is still active fire behavior occurring along with areas that are smoldering.  Yesterday crews mopped up <br />
on the east side of the fire and patrolled the southern perimeter.  A spot fire on the north end was caught by <br />
firefighters on the ground assisted by air attack and three Type 1 helicopters.  On the west side, the fire <br />
crossed the 832 Road and is being held within planned contingency lines. <br />
<br />
Today crews and equipment will be mopping up on the southern portion of the fire area, while continuing to <br />
build and strengthen control lines west of the Little Malheur River.  Mop up will also be done on the northern <br />
and east sides.  On the west side of the fire, there may be burnout operations as needed that could increase <br />
the smoke visible in the area. <br />
<br />
Fuels are very receptive to fire because of the extreme persistent drought being experienced in Grant, <br />
Harney, Malheur and Baker Counties.  Today’s temperatures will be in the upper 80s to low 90s with light <br />
winds.  Smoke will continue to impact air quality and it is expected to be unhealthy for sensitive groups. <br />
<br />
Closures:  <br />
<br />
The Big Creek Campground is closed on the Malheur National Forest as of August 8, 2021.  For <br />
updatedForest closure information, please visit the Forest webpageat www.fs.usda.gov/malheur or Facebook <br />

Overview:The Bull Complex has experienced moderate growth over the last several days.The most active part of <br />
the <br />
complex is with the Janus, Ridge, and Kola Fires as they are burning in the steep and rugged terrain of the Bull <br />
of the <br />
Woods Wilderness. The number one priority for all firefighting operations is firefighter and public safety. Full <br />
suppression strategies continue to be a key objective on the Bull Complex to extinguish and limit fire spread.   <br />
<br />
Current Situation: Fire crews continue to work to the south and southeast of Janus, Ridge, and Kola Fires <br />
mitigating the <br />
vegetation along Forest Road 6370. Crews will be working on the west side of the fire along Forest Road 4696 <br />
improving containment lines and identifying and removing snags along the line. Snags are dead, standing trees <br />
that <br />
present a significant hazard to firefighters, as they typically burn more quickly and increase the risk of injury to <br />
firefighters.  <br />
<br />
Crews will be working on the north side of the fire along Forest Road 63 and south to Forest Road 6370 near <br />
Ogre <br />
Creek to improve containment lines. Firefighters are utilizing previous burn scars to limit the spread of the fire to <br />
the <br />
northwest.   Weather: The Excessive Heat Warning is still in effect until 10 p.m., Saturday. Weather conditions <br />
continue <br />
to be hot and dry with temperatures hovering around 100 degrees. Increased fire behavior continues as relative <br />
humidity remains low combined with hot daytime temperatures.   <br />
<br />
Smoke will continue to remain over the fire area and will be visible throughout the area. Affected communities <br />
should <br />
remain aware of smoke advisories and conditions. More information can be found at - www.airnow.gov or the <br />
Oregon <br />
Smoke Blog - https://oregonsmoke.blogspot.com/?m=1   <br />

<br />
Bulldog Mountain Fire:  Yesterday the smoke that continues to blanket the region persisted on the fire line and <br />
kept fire activity moderate.  Unfortunately the smoke prevented aircraft from flying over the fire.  Firefighters <br />
continued the slow and deliberate process of indirect and contingency line construction.  Crews were able to <br />
do direct fire attack in some areas of the fire. <br />
<br />
Today firefighters will be paying close attention to the weather as a low pressure system moves into the <br />
region. A red flag warning has been issued for most of eastern Washington.  Crews will continue to finish up <br />
indirect containment lines around the fire.  Aircraft will be requested to assist if smoke conditions allow.<br />
<br />
The Bulldog Mountain Fire started August 5. 2021, located 20 miles north of Kettle Falls. The lightning caused <br />
fire spread quickly due to low relative humidity and unseasonably dry conditions.  The fire is burning in heavy <br />
timber and slash.  The fire is currently estimated at 2900 acres with 5% containment.<br />
<br />
Mack Mountain Fire:  The Mack Mountain Fire started August 5, 2021 and is just south west of the Bulldog <br />
Mountain Fire.  The fire is estimated at approximately 100 acres.  Residents in the Deadman Creek area may <br />
see smoke from the fire.  The fire area is located in steep, rugged terrain with limited access.  Fire managers <br />
have begun the process of accessing areas around the fire that may be used for future access to build fire <br />
line.  If visibility improves, fire managers will continue to use aerial reconnaissance to evaluate the fire and <br />
plan for future needs.<br />
<br />
Citizens should remain vigilant and are strongly encouraged to sign up for alerts at Ferry County Alerts.  <br />
Motorists traveling on the Boulder Hwy should be vigilant and watch for heavy equipment and firefighters <br />
turning off and onto the roadway.  There are 185 personnel assigned to the incident. There have been two <br />
minor injuries with no structures lost.  Firefighter and public safety is our number one priority.  <br />
<br />
Level 1 evacuation orders and road closures are in place. For current evacuation orders please see Ferry <br />
County Sheriff’s Office Facebook page.  Boulder Creek Hwy and State Route 395 remain open.  For <br />
information on area & road closures on the Colville National Forest please see <br />
https://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fseprd938379.pdf   Citizens are asked to stay clear of <br />
the fire area and adhere to road and area closures. <br />
<br />
Northeast Washington Interagency Incident Management Team 2 (NEWIMT2) assumed command of the fire <br />
August 7th at 11:00 a.m.  Fire information and the incident command post is located at Kettle Falls High <br />
School in Kettle Falls, WA. Fire information contact is Jeff Sevigney 509 993-2946 or you can also follow us <br />

Winthrop, WA —The Cedar Creek, Cub Creek 2 and Delancy Fires are burning on the Okanogan-Wenatchee <br />
National Forest and public and private lands within Okanogan County.<br />
<br />
Fire Information Line: 509-557-0740 (8:00 am to 8:00 pm daily)<br />
<br />
Cedar Creek Fire: The fire has been mapped at 53,475 acres and is 50% contained. Firefighters are securing <br />
lines to the northwest of the Twisp River drainage. Contingency lines, consisting of shaded fuel breaks, are <br />
being built in the Canyon Creek area. These contingency lines are connecting old fire scars to slow fire <br />
spread to the south toward the community of Twisp. In areas where the fireline has been declared controlled <br />
crews have begun backhauling excess supplies and equipment.<br />
<br />
Minimal fire behavior was observed on the northern end of the fire. Mop up has begun on the northern flank <br />
after crews worked to secure direct line in the Vasiliki Ridge area.<br />
<br />
Todays wind is expected to push the fire back into it’s existing footprint. Fire activity is likely to increase as the <br />
wind fans remaining pockets of fuel in the interior ignite.<br />
<br />
Cub Creek 2 Fire: The Cub Creek Fire is 67,458 acres and 55% contained. The fire remains active on the <br />
northern edges of the fire, with some spot fires and creeping. On the northwest flank firefighters are <br />
monitoring some spot fires that have been challenging to extinguish due to the terrain. The perimeter around <br />
the Brevicomis Summer Homes has been largely secured but firefighters are remaining in the area. The fire <br />
near Lake Creek continues to push north into the 2003 Farewell Fire scar, slowly burning through the dead <br />
and downed fuels. Firefighters are mopping up along the 51 Road where they can access and are monitoring <br />
interior fire. The northeast flank is slowly creeping around to the east, and with today’s anticipated winds the <br />
fire will likely be pushed into more rocky terrain minimizing fire behavior. Suppression repair and hazard tree <br />
mitigation is ongoing in many areas across the southern perimeters of the fire.<br />
<br />
Delancy Fire:  The 223 acre Delancy Fire has not moved for several days and is 85% contained. IR surveys <br />
have not shown heat within the perimeter.<br />
<br />
Fire Weather: A Red Flag Warning is in effect for today. Winds are expected to be gusting at 20-30 mph from <br />
the west, with winds picking up around 3pm on the Cedar Creek and Cub Creek 2 fires, and 5pm on the <br />
Muckamuck Fire. A colder air mass is moving across the Cascades. The winds will move a large amount of <br />
the smoke out of the area, allowing the sun to reach the fuels and dry them out, increasing fire behavior. <br />
Expect to see smoke columns visible from both fires tomorrow.<br />
<br />
Evacuations: The community of Mazama (west) remains in a Level 2 evacuation status.</span>

As of early yesterday the Walker Creek and Spur fires have merged and will now be managed as one fire, <br />
referred to as the Walker Creek Fire. Acreages shown are the combined acreages for the Walker Creek and <br />
former Spur fires.<br />
Walker Creek Fire: A RED FLAG WARNING is in effect today for low humidities and gusty winds from the <br />
west and southwest. Fire behavior is expected to be active today. Crews will be strongly focusing on structure <br />
protection and strategically placing resources around the fire area in anticipation of today’s fire behavior. <br />
Structure protection will continue in the area of the Boy Scout camp and east of the Bonaparte Lake Road. On <br />
the southeast side crews will be doing further structure protection and patrolling for spot fires along the Bunch <br />
Road. Overnight, additional structure protection was done in the Walker Lake area and day shift crews will <br />
continue that work today. On the southwest side of the fire crews will be patrolling the south side of the 3230 <br />
road for spot fires. Fireline construction and improvement will be done to tie in to the Bonaparte Lake Road <br />
from the 3230 road. <br />
A number of communities have had their evacuation levels changed. Please refer to the Okanogan County, <br />
WA  county wide advisory map for updated changes. <br />
Chickadee Creek Fire: Little to no growth occurred as crews continue to use engine crews and some heavy <br />
equipment to enforce the line. In addition, they will patrol for spot fires outside containment lines. Personnel <br />
will continue to look for hot spots and assist where needed. <br />

Winthrop, WA —The Cedar Creek, Cub Creek 2 and Delancy Fires are burning on the Okanogan-Wenatchee <br />
National Forest and public and private lands within Okanogan County.<br />
<br />
Fire Information Line: 509-557-0740 (8:00 am to 8:00 pm daily)<br />
<br />
Cedar Creek Fire: The fire has been mapped at 53,475 acres and is 50% contained. Firefighters are securing <br />
lines to the northwest of the Twisp River drainage. Contingency lines, consisting of shaded fuel breaks, are <br />
being built in the Canyon Creek area. These contingency lines are connecting old fire scars to slow fire <br />
spread to the south toward the community of Twisp. In areas where the fireline has been declared controlled <br />
crews have begun backhauling excess supplies and equipment.<br />
<br />
Minimal fire behavior was observed on the northern end of the fire. Mop up has begun on the northern flank <br />
after crews worked to secure direct line in the Vasiliki Ridge area.<br />
<br />
Todays wind is expected to push the fire back into it’s existing footprint. Fire activity is likely to increase as the <br />
wind fans remaining pockets of fuel in the interior ignite.<br />
<br />
Cub Creek 2 Fire: The Cub Creek Fire is 67,458 acres and 55% contained. The fire remains active on the <br />
northern edges of the fire, with some spot fires and creeping. On the northwest flank firefighters are <br />
monitoring some spot fires that have been challenging to extinguish due to the terrain. The perimeter around <br />
the Brevicomis Summer Homes has been largely secured but firefighters are remaining in the area. The fire <br />
near Lake Creek continues to push north into the 2003 Farewell Fire scar, slowly burning through the dead <br />
and downed fuels. Firefighters are mopping up along the 51 Road where they can access and are monitoring <br />
interior fire. The northeast flank is slowly creeping around to the east, and with today’s anticipated winds the <br />
fire will likely be pushed into more rocky terrain minimizing fire behavior. Suppression repair and hazard tree <br />
mitigation is ongoing in many areas across the southern perimeters of the fire.<br />
<br />
Delancy Fire:  The 223 acre Delancy Fire has not moved for several days and is 85% contained. IR surveys <br />
have not shown heat within the perimeter.<br />
<br />
Fire Weather: A Red Flag Warning is in effect for today. Winds are expected to be gusting at 20-30 mph from <br />
the west, with winds picking up around 3pm on the Cedar Creek and Cub Creek 2 fires, and 5pm on the <br />
Muckamuck Fire. A colder air mass is moving across the Cascades. The winds will move a large amount of <br />
the smoke out of the area, allowing the sun to reach the fuels and dry them out, increasing fire behavior. <br />
Expect to see smoke columns visible from both fires tomorrow.<br />
<br />
Evacuations: The community of Mazama (west) remains in a Level 2 evacuation status.</span>

<br />
The Devil's Knob Complex is a group of lightning-caused fires with the majority burning on the Tiller Ranger <br />
District, Umpqua National Forest and several fires burning on private lands protected by Douglas Forest <br />
Protective Association. The Devil’s Knob Complex is situated between the Rough Patch Complex and Jack <br />
Fire to the north, which is being managed by Great Basin Team 2 and the Skyline Ridge Complex to the <br />
southwest, which is being managed by Oregon Department of Forestry Team 1. The Devil's Knob Complex is <br />
managed by Northwest Incident Management Team 8 from an incident command post at the Milo Academy <br />
near Tiller, Oregon.    <br />
General Updates:  As fires become contained and mopped up in the southern portion of the Complex, <br />
resources are being relocated to the central and northern portions of the Complex to other priority fires. <br />
Nineteen fires within the Complex are considered contained, controlled or out.   Two burnouts were conducted <br />
on the Big Hamlin Fire last night. <br />
The following is a summary of the significant fire activity over the fire complex starting from north to south: <br />
Smith Fire – 1251 acres – A heavy equipment group is nearing completion of indirect containment line running <br />
from the north-northwest corner of the fire down south to tie into the Dumont Creek Road. Contingency line <br />
construction options are also being explored farther east and west in case current containment efforts are not <br />
successful. Mule Creek Fire – 1,023 acres – mop up operations continue. Big Hamlin Fire – 5,006 acres – <br />
mop up along the western flank continues.  Successful burn out operations were conducted yesterday into the <br />
evening on northern and southern areas of the fire.  Burn out operations in the northeast were successful at <br />
holding the fire along Jackson Creek to prevent the fire from moving onto private lands. Burn out operations in <br />
the southern corner of the fire were also successful at keeping the fire off private lands.  Old fire lines from the <br />
Whiskey Fire (2013) are being reopened to use as indirect containment lines out in front of the eastern flank <br />
of the fire.  Little Applegate Fire – 135 acres – currently holding in the existing footprint and mop up continues.  <br />
Wild Cat Fire – 215 acres – mop up operations continue. Numerous green and dead trees have been falling <br />
outside containment lines but no spot fires have resulted.  An unstaffed sprinkler system along the east flank <br />
of the fire continues to be effective and will continue to be operated in areas too hazardous for firefighters. <br />
Section 30 (Railroad) Fire – 76 acres – contained and in patrol status. Dismal Creek (444) Fire – 40 acres – <br />
contained and in patrol status. The firefighting resources on the Devil's Knob Complex are also responsible <br />
for conducting initial attack operations on the entire Tiller Ranger District and private land holdings. <br />
Firefighters are prepared to respond to any initial fire starts.</span>

Lakeview, Ore.  –  The Fox Complex, which includes the Patton Meadow and Willow Valley fires, is now under <br />
the unified command of Oregon Department of Forestry’s Incident Management Team 3 and Oregon State <br />
Fire <br />
Marshal’s Blue Team.<br />
<br />
The arrival of the two teams brings in additional overhead capacity and firefighting resources. The teams are <br />
setting up their incident command post at the Lake County Fairgrounds and working on arrangements for a <br />
forward operating base for crews and amenities to support them.<br />
<br />
The Patton Meadow Fire is burning on the Fremont-Winema National Forest and private lands protected by <br />
the <br />
Oregon Department of Forestry about 10 miles west of Lakeview. Fire behavior picked up overnight as winds <br />
out <br />
of the north pushed the fire over and to the south of Highway 140 and west of the 383 road. Night crews and <br />
dozers were able to corral the fire in both areas and will continue to strengthen those lines throughout today. <br />
Current mapping shows the fire at about 4,100 acres.<br />
<br />
OSFM’s Blue Team is supporting the effort by providing structure protection around homes along Hwy 140 <br />
with 7 <br />
structural taskforces and 2 more taskforces arriving today. The crews will assess homes, create defensible <br />
space <br />
around the homes when feasible, and assist wildland firefighting crews in creating containment lines that will <br />
help <br />
protect structures.<br />
<br />
The Willow Valley Fire, about 16 miles south of Bonanza, is estimated at about 770 acres. The fire is burning <br />
mostly on Bureau of Land Management (BLM) Lakeview District lands north of the Stateline, as well as part of <br />
the Modoc National Forest to the south.  ODF protected lands are threatened. No structures are threatened <br />
on <br />
the Willow Valley Fire.<br />
<br />
With the teams still getting established, resources are on order and beginning to trickle in. Four large, type 1 <br />
helicopters are also expected to arrive this afternoon.<br />
<br />
Lake County Sheriff’s Office is managing evacuation levels. Level 1, 2 and 3 evacuation notifications are in <br />
place <br />
within and around the fire area. Stay up to date on evacuation levels by visiting <br />

remains 15% contained. Crews have been patrolling and mopping up the fire’s perimeter along the Kendall <br />
Skyline Road on the fire’s southwest edge as well as along the 22 (4022) Road from Tucannon Road to the <br />
Lick Creek Fire perimeter. Crews have continued to search for pockets of heat and engage where it is safe to <br />
do so in Branch I on the northern and western edge of the fire. Fire activity was minimal on the north and west <br />
sides of the fire in divisions G, K, and M on Saturday. In Division P, on the south side of the fire, firefighters <br />
continued to scout for possible contingency lines.<br />
<br />
Today, afternoon winds out of the southwest are expected to push the fire northeast towards established lines <br />
in Division M. Firefighters will be in place on the northern end of the fire to patrol existing lines and engage in <br />
any threats to the lines in Division M. Firefighters will secure and scout for additional contingency lines to the <br />
north of the fire in Division H and to the southeast of the Green Ridge fire perimeter in Division P. Some <br />
firefighting resources are starting to be positioned in Div P to begin constructing indirect fire lines in the <br />
coming days once scouting is complete.<br />
<br />
Current Situation: Lick Creek Fire: The Lick Creek fire remains 80,421 acres and containment increased to <br />
97%, with the remaining 3% of unsecured line on the southwest edge of the fire’s perimeter. The Lick Creek <br />
Fire currently has 2 two Type 3 engines, one Type 4 engine, one Type 6 engine, one bulldozer, one tactical <br />
water tender, and eight support water tenders assigned to the incident. On Saturday, favorable west-<br />
northwest winds pushed heat and smoke into the interior and away from established fire lines. Interior fuels <br />
continue to smolder within the fire perimeter with occasional torching. On Sunday, assigned resources will <br />
continue to improve and monitor containment lines, shifting to help firefighting efforts on Green Ridge where <br />
needed during periods of increased fire activity.<br />
<br />
Weather & Smoke Information: Winds are expected to increase this afternoon ahead of a passing cold front. <br />
West southwest winds are expected to be 8-12 mph, with gusts to 20 mph. The wind is expected to clear the <br />
heavy smoke out of the area. Temperatures will be in the 80s along the ridges and in the mid-90s in the valley <br />
bottoms. Smoke information is available on Washington Smoke Blog at: https://wasmoke.blogspot.com/<br />
<br />
Forest Closures: Closures are in place on the Umatilla National Forest. The forest closure for some areas on <br />
the Umatilla NF have been amended. The amended order reopened most Umatilla NF lands in Oregon. The <br />
order also closed all lands on the Walla Walla Ranger District in Washington; forest lands in the Pomeroy <br />
Ranger District will remain closed to entry. the order is available at https://go.usa.gov/xFyhn.<br />
<br />

GLIDE, Ore. – Fire crews made headway bolstering the containment lines on the Chaos Fire, while keeping it <br />
from moving farther west or south.  Work will continue today on mopping up along containment lines, <br />
conducting direct attack where feasible, and indirect attack where appropriate based on weather, fuels, and <br />
topography. Firefighter and the public safety are always a priority during wildland fire fighting operations. <br />
<br />
Operations on the Jack Fire will focus on strengthening containment lines while working on additional indirect <br />
lines to keep the fire from moving west. The South Chilcoot Fire are now in patrol status, firefighters will <br />
continue to monitor the containment lines ensuring they remain secure. Throughout the fire zones, firefighters <br />
are working to secure and reinforce about 70 miles of primary, alternate and contingency line, while also <br />
suppressing fires that have crossed containment lines and engage any spot fires. <br />
<br />
Great Basin Team 2, a Type 1 Incident Management Team led by Tony DeMasters, has assumed command of <br />
the Rough Patch Complex and Jack Fire at 7 a.m. Sunday Aug. 16. Great Basin Team 2 would like to thank <br />
fire managers from NW13 for the hard work they have put into managing these fires. <br />
<br />
Fire activity continued to be subdued Saturday due to a temperature inversion holding the smoke near the <br />
ground, causing limited visibility and hampering flight operations. Weather conditions are forecasted to begin <br />
cooling with smoke starting to lift Sunday afternoon and clearing out by Wednesday.  <br />
<br />
Friday, the Umpqua and Willamette National Forests updated existing closure orders to encompass the <br />
Rough Patch, Jack, Archie Creek and Devil's Knob Fire Areas. This includes Canton Creek Campground, <br />
Musick Guard Station and Cover Campground. <br />
<br />
Roseburg District Bureau of Land Management has expanded its closure area to include the Scaredman <br />
Recreation Site. Francis Creek Road from the junction with Canton Creek Road north to the district boundary <br />
has been closed since Aug. 5.</span>

Kwis Fire: Sprinkler systems were installed to strengthen containment lines on elevated terrain and in areas <br />
not adjacent to road systems. Today will be a continuation of mop up and patrols with heavy equipment <br />
working on alternate containment lines. As operations are completed, resources are re-positioned to where <br />
they will be most effectively utilized on the complex. Some will be shifted to other locations associated with <br />
the Kwis Fire, and others will be re-located to aid in suppression efforts on the Gales or Ninemile Fires.  <br />
<br />
Kwis Fire Structure Protection: Structural triage has been completed in Oakridge, Oakridge area Level 2 <br />
Evacuation Zone and the Level 3 Evacuation Zone west of the Gales Fire. Firefighter Risk Assessment <br />
Placards were posted, increasing fire suppression safety for homeowners. The information assessed by Task <br />
Forces has been gathered and will be shared with your local fire response agencies, giving them critical <br />
response information should fire risk increase. This gives Lowell and Oakridge Fires a head start if the need <br />
arises to engage in structure protection. <br />
<br />
The Oregon State Fire Marshal’s (OSFM) Incident Management Team is evaluating fire needs and is in <br />
discussions with local fire officials to determine transition. Crews are expected to be demobilized to their <br />
home districts. If needed, crews can be re-activated to the complex. OSFM crews are activated through the <br />
state mobilization plan and the Lane County Fire Defense Board Chief. Additional evaluation of demobilization <br />
will likely occur over the next 48 hours. Considerations used are weather, risk to life and property, perimeter <br />
holds, contingency lines, and completion of mission tasks. <br />
<br />
Knoll Fire: Firefighters have been successful holding the Knoll fire within containment lines for the last several <br />
days. Mop up and patrol for spot fires are ongoing. Smoke will remain visible as unburned vegetation within <br />
the containment line is consumed. Management of this fire will be transferred back to the Willamette National <br />
Forest on Monday. <br />
<br />
Gales and Ninemile Fires: Heavy equipment and other specialized resources are arriving to the Gales and <br />
Ninemile fires. Preparation of containment lines along Forest Road 18 and other roads is ongoing. Strategic <br />
burning operations, utilizing both hand and aerial ignition to reduce available fuel between containment lines <br />
and the active fire will take place in the future when burning conditions are right for successful <br />
implementation. Aerial ignition operation will include the use of a plastic sphere dispenser (PSD). The device <br />
delivers spheres containing potassium permanganate that are injected with ethylene glycol (antifreeze) before <br />
being discharged. A chemical reaction between the potassium permanganate and ethylene glycol causes the <br />
sphere to ignite approximately 20 to 30 seconds after injection. A short video demonstrating the use of PSD <br />
devices is available at www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iPNOw-oQgo. <br />
<br />
Evacuations: Level 1, 2 and 3 evacuation notices are in place in Lane County. Current evacuation information <br />
and an interactive map of evacuation areas are available at www.lanecounty.org. Linn County has also issued <br />
a Level 1 evacuation notice for the Knoll Fire, more information is available at: https://buff.ly/3CutPQR. <br />
<br />
Closures: Some National Forest System lands near the Middle Fork Complex and Knoll fires are temporarily <br />
closed to provide for public safety. For more information visit www.fs.usda.gov/willamette. The Oregon State <br />
Marine Board issued a temporary closure on a portion of the McKenzie River, for more information visit: <br />

Current Situation: Green Ridge Fire: On Saturday, the Green Ridge Fire continued to move to the south, <br />
reaching the north side of Misery Ridge and the west side of Mount Misery. The fire grew to 34,644 acres and <br />
remains 15% contained. Crews have been patrolling and mopping up the fire’s perimeter along the Kendall <br />
Skyline Road on the fire’s southwest edge as well as along the 22 (4022) Road from Tucannon Road to the <br />
Lick Creek Fire perimeter. Crews have continued to search for pockets of heat and engage where it is safe to <br />
do so in Branch I on the northern and western edge of the fire. Fire activity was minimal on the north and west <br />
sides of the fire in divisions G, K, and M on Saturday. In Division P, on the south side of the fire, firefighters <br />
continued to scout for possible contingency lines.<br />
<br />
Today, afternoon winds out of the southwest are expected to push the fire northeast towards established lines <br />
in Division M. Firefighters will be in place on the northern end of the fire to patrol existing lines and engage in <br />
any threats to the lines in Division M. Firefighters will secure and scout for additional contingency lines to the <br />
north of the fire in Division H and to the southeast of the Green Ridge fire perimeter in Division P. Some <br />
firefighting resources are starting to be positioned in Div P to begin constructing indirect fire lines in the <br />
coming days once scouting is complete.<br />
<br />
Current Situation: Lick Creek Fire: The Lick Creek fire remains 80,421 acres and containment increased to <br />
97%, with the remaining 3% of unsecured line on the southwest edge of the fire’s perimeter. The Lick Creek <br />
Fire currently has 2 two Type 3 engines, one Type 4 engine, one Type 6 engine, one bulldozer, one tactical <br />
water tender, and eight support water tenders assigned to the incident. On Saturday, favorable west-<br />
northwest winds pushed heat and smoke into the interior and away from established fire lines. Interior fuels <br />
continue to smolder within the fire perimeter with occasional torching. On Sunday, assigned resources will <br />
continue to improve and monitor containment lines, shifting to help firefighting efforts on Green Ridge where <br />
needed during periods of increased fire activity.<br />
<br />
Weather & Smoke Information: Winds are expected to increase this afternoon ahead of a passing cold front. <br />
West southwest winds are expected to be 8-12 mph, with gusts to 20 mph. The wind is expected to clear the <br />
heavy smoke out of the area. Temperatures will be in the 80s along the ridges and in the mid-90s in the valley <br />
bottoms. Smoke information is available on Washington Smoke Blog at: https://wasmoke.blogspot.com/<br />
<br />
Forest Closures: Closures are in place on the Umatilla National Forest. The forest closure for some areas on <br />
the Umatilla NF have been amended. The amended order reopened most Umatilla NF lands in Oregon. The <br />
order also closed all lands on the Walla Walla Ranger District in Washington; forest lands in the Pomeroy <br />
Ranger District will remain closed to entry. the order is available at https://go.usa.gov/xFyhn.<br />
<br />
Evacuations: Garfield County currently has Level 1, 2 and 3 evacuations in place. Level 1 evacuations were <br />
added on Thursday for Grouse Flats in southern Garfield County. For more information on evacuations in <br />
Garfield County, please visit https://go.usa.gov/xFyM4. Columbia County currently has Level 3, Level 2, and <br />
Level 1 evacuations in place. Wallowa County, Oregon currently has Level 1 evacuations in place for Grouse <br />
Flats. An interactive fire map that shows evacuations and other important information is available at <br />

Kwis Fire: Sprinkler systems were installed to strengthen containment lines on elevated terrain and in areas <br />
not adjacent to road systems. Today will be a continuation of mop up and patrols with heavy equipment <br />
working on alternate containment lines. As operations are completed, resources are re-positioned to where <br />
they will be most effectively utilized on the complex. Some will be shifted to other locations associated with <br />
the Kwis Fire, and others will be re-located to aid in suppression efforts on the Gales or Ninemile Fires.  <br />

Kwis Fire Structure Protection: Structural triage has been completed in Oakridge, Oakridge area Level 2 <br />
Evacuation Zone and the Level 3 Evacuation Zone west of the Gales Fire. Firefighter Risk Assessment <br />
Placards were posted, increasing fire suppression safety for homeowners. The information assessed by Task <br />
Forces has been gathered and will be shared with your local fire response agencies, giving them critical <br />
response information should fire risk increase. This gives Lowell and Oakridge Fires a head start if the need <br />
arises to engage in structure protection. <br />
<br />
The Oregon State Fire Marshal’s (OSFM) Incident Management Team is evaluating fire needs and is in <br />
discussions with local fire officials to determine transition. Crews are expected to be demobilized to their <br />
home districts. If needed, crews can be re-activated to the complex. OSFM crews are activated through the <br />
state mobilization plan and the Lane County Fire Defense Board Chief. Additional evaluation of demobilization <br />
will likely occur over the next 48 hours. Considerations used are weather, risk to life and property, perimeter <br />
holds, contingency lines, and completion of mission tasks. <br />
<br />
Knoll Fire: Firefighters have been successful holding the Knoll fire within containment lines for the last several <br />
days. Mop up and patrol for spot fires are ongoing. Smoke will remain visible as unburned vegetation within <br />
the containment line is consumed. Management of this fire will be transferred back to the Willamette National <br />
Forest on Monday. <br />
<br />
Gales and Ninemile Fires: Heavy equipment and other specialized resources are arriving to the Gales and <br />
Ninemile fires. Preparation of containment lines along Forest Road 18 and other roads is ongoing. Strategic <br />
burning operations, utilizing both hand and aerial ignition to reduce available fuel between containment lines <br />
and the active fire will take place in the future when burning conditions are right for successful <br />
implementation. Aerial ignition operation will include the use of a plastic sphere dispenser (PSD). The device <br />
delivers spheres containing potassium permanganate that are injected with ethylene glycol (antifreeze) before <br />
being discharged. A chemical reaction between the potassium permanganate and ethylene glycol causes the <br />
sphere to ignite approximately 20 to 30 seconds after injection. A short video demonstrating the use of PSD <br />
devices is available at www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iPNOw-oQgo. <br />
<br />
Evacuations: Level 1, 2 and 3 evacuation notices are in place in Lane County. Current evacuation information <br />
and an interactive map of evacuation areas are available at www.lanecounty.org. Linn County has also issued <br />
a Level 1 evacuation notice for the Knoll Fire, more information is available at: https://buff.ly/3CutPQR. <br />
<br />
Closures: Some National Forest System lands near the Middle Fork Complex and Knoll fires are temporarily <br />
closed to provide for public safety. For more information visit www.fs.usda.gov/willamette. The Oregon State <br />
Marine Board issued a temporary closure on a portion of the McKenzie River, for more information visit: <br />

Current Situation: Building on the completion of the initial line around the perimeter of the Muckamuck Fire the <br />
previous day, crews were able to focus their attention on direct attack and strengthening contingency lines. <br />
Terrain and weather conditions were in our favor allowing scooper planes and helicopters to drop water on the <br />
fire. As the fire moves into spruce trees there is a higher possibility of spot fires, any spots would be short <br />
range if it does occur. Night patrols will continue over the next few days.<br />
<br />
Today, line construction will continue, with air support as visibility allows. The SE portion, Division Oscar, <br />
towards Muckamuck Pass is the priority as our fire fighters focus on stopping forward progress of the fire.  <br />
Several mechanical resources are being used to remove hazards and build line, including dozers, skidders <br />
and chippers. Hazard trees are being removed to help ensure the safety of our fire fighters.<br />
<br />
The Conconully area is in a level one evacuation notice. Citizens and visitors are reminded to be aware of <br />
their surroundings and ready to evacuate should the need arise.<br />
<br />
Weather: A red flag warning is in effect with wind gusts up to 30 mph. Humidity will remain low with <br />
temperatures cooling down five degrees from yesterday.<br />

Containment lines from division Whiskey to division Alpha were completed and reinforced prior to burnout <br />
operations. Zulu division has been moped up 150’ and has been put into a patrol status. <br />
<br />
Overnight an IR flight was completed. The aircraft is equipped with the ability to Infrared scan the entire burn <br />
area and map fire hot spots within containment lines. This helps fire managers place resources in the areas that <br />
need attention.<br />
 <br />
Today, Firefighter’s mission today will be mop up of the burnout area from yesterday’s operations.  Division Z will <br />
be in a patrol status while mop up continues in division W.<br />
<br />
   Sunny skies and hot temperatures with low relative humidity today, along with gusty afternoon winds can <br />
change fire behavior and will be monitored throughout the day.<br />

GLIDE, Ore. – Fire crews made headway bolstering the containment lines on the Chaos Fire, while keeping it <br />
from moving farther west or south.  Work will continue today on mopping up along containment lines, <br />
conducting direct attack where feasible, and indirect attack where appropriate based on weather, fuels, and <br />
topography. Firefighter and the public safety are always a priority during wildland fire fighting operations. <br />
<br />
Operations on the Jack Fire will focus on strengthening containment lines while working on additional indirect <br />
lines to keep the fire from moving west. The South Chilcoot Fire are now in patrol status, firefighters will <br />
continue to monitor the containment lines ensuring they remain secure. Throughout the fire zones, firefighters <br />
are working to secure and reinforce about 70 miles of primary, alternate and contingency line, while also <br />
suppressing fires that have crossed containment lines and engage any spot fires. <br />
<br />
Great Basin Team 2, a Type 1 Incident Management Team led by Tony DeMasters, has assumed command of <br />
the Rough Patch Complex and Jack Fire at 7 a.m. Sunday Aug. 16. Great Basin Team 2 would like to thank <br />
fire managers from NW13 for the hard work they have put into managing these fires. <br />
<br />
Fire activity continued to be subdued Saturday due to a temperature inversion holding the smoke near the <br />
ground, causing limited visibility and hampering flight operations. Weather conditions are forecasted to begin <br />
cooling with smoke starting to lift Sunday afternoon and clearing out by Wednesday.  <br />
<br />
Friday, the Umpqua and Willamette National Forests updated existing closure orders to encompass the <br />
Rough Patch, Jack, Archie Creek and Devil's Knob Fire Areas. This includes Canton Creek Campground, <br />
Musick Guard Station and Cover Campground. <br />
<br />
Roseburg District Bureau of Land Management has expanded its closure area to include the Scaredman <br />
Recreation Site. Francis Creek Road from the junction with Canton Creek Road north to the district boundary <br />
has been closed since Aug. 5.</span>

<br />
Yesterday: A public meeting was held at 6:30 at the Nile-Cliffdell Fire Department, and the public was <br />
presented valuable updates and contact information and were able to hear from collaborators and partners <br />
actively engaged in keeping their communities protected.Perimeter growth mainly occurred western and <br />
southern portions. Fire personnel were in and around properties and homes along both the Highway 410 <br />
corridor and the Bumping River Road, planning and preparing for structure protection on private property and <br />
mapping areas suitable for containment line construction. This is an essential step in preparing to defend the <br />
area from possible future fire spread. Firefighter and public safety remain the number one priority of the <br />
incident, and incident managers, cooperators and local partners do not take decisions lightly. An extension to <br />
the Forest Closure Order was authorized, extending the closure to cover lands north of Highway 410 and to <br />
the western portion of the Wilderness Area to Highway 410.<br />
<br />
Today: Expect smoky conditions to linger through the day, causing potential visibility and air quality issues. <br />
Drivers are reminded to remain cognizant of changing conditions, and for an increase in traffic from <br />
emergency response vehicles. A frontal passage will mostly push the fire south and east. With a shift in winds <br />
forecasted, fire growth will be to the northeast toward Highway 410 and west toward Bumping River Road. <br />
Crews are utilizing hoses and sprinklers along Bumping River Road, and along the Highway 410 corridor. <br />
Structure preparation is being conducted to the north, and dozer containment lines are holding well in the <br />
south east along the Rattlesnake drainage. Cooler weather and higher humidity are expected next week, <br />
which will provide better conditions for both ground and air support. The new Forest Closure Order (dated <br />
August 14) does not affect travel on Hwy 410, nor does it mean the highway is closed. However, residents <br />
and visitors to the area are encouraged to remain mindful of rapidly changing conditions. An Excessive Heat <br />
Warning and Air Quality Alert are in effect for today: https://bit.ly/SSFweather.<br />
<br />
Evacuations: Bumping River Road and drainage remains at a LEVEL 3 evacuation. This means if you live in <br />
the area that you need to evacuate now. Hwy 410 from Eagle Rock north and west to Bumping River Road is <br />
currently in a LEVEL 2 Evacuation. This means if you live in the area you need to BE SET. Please check with <br />
Yakima County Office of Emergency Management on their official Facebook page <br />
https://www.facebook.com/YakimaCountyOEM for updates on evacuation information. Residents and visitors <br />
are encouraged to sign up for geo-specific emergency alerts through Yakima County: <br />
https://www.yakimacounty.us/2222/Alert-Yakima<br />
<br />
Closures:  An extension to the current temporary Forest closure order for National Forest lands has been <br />
issued, and covers the northwest portion of the William O. Douglas Wilderness Area to Hwy 410, and north of <br />
Hwy 410 in the Little Naches drainage. Agency personnel have been making notifications in recreation areas, <br />
advising visitors to vacate the area. The closure order and map will be available soon at <br />
https://bit.ly/ForestClosureOrders (see the Naches Ranger District table).</span>

Crews Mop-up the Poole Creek Fire<br />
<br />
CANYONVILLE, Ore.— The Poole Creek Fire has a completed control line around it, crews will continue with <br />
mop-up today. Mopping up is very detailed, digging out burning roots and using water to remove all remaining <br />
heat. Containment has climbed to 34%.At this stage in the fire residents and visitors can expect to see a red <br />
glow at night, especially within the interior of the fire. Smoke and occasional flare ups may still be visible.<br />
<br />
Firefighters and engines will continue to patrol the fire 24/7 until it is no longer required. Although mopping up <br />
is now the main focus, crews have a number of other tasks to complete. They will also be locating, identifying <br />
and mitigating hazard trees. Also referred to as snags, these pose a serious hazard to firefighters. Snags are <br />
standing dead trees that are prone to unexpectedly falling. Crews will also be installing waterbars, which are <br />
important to help prevent erosion from seasonal rains. Water bars divert rain to control erosion of hand lines <br />
and dozer lines created during fire suppression.<br />
<br />
Fire teams from both the Skyline Ridge and Devil’s Knob complexes held a joint in-person community <br />
meeting last night in Tiller. The event will be posted on the Douglas Fire Protection Association's YouTube <br />
channel and the Skyline Ridge Complex Facebook Page. DFPA's YouTube channels link is <br />

IInchelium, WA – The Summit Trail Fire was started by lightning on July 12, and is burning on the Colville <br />
Reservation approximately 17 miles west of Inchelium.  The Upper Lime Creek Fire, started by lightning on <br />
August 4, is also burning on the Colville Reservation approximately 6 miles north of Keller. Both fires are <br />
being managed by Northwest Incident Management Team 10, with 471 personnel engaged in fighting the <br />
fires.<br />
<br />
Poor air quality persisted through Saturday as heavy smoke from fires in Washington and British Columbia <br />
impacted the region, and decreased visibility kept aircraft from flying. Hot and dry weather continues to <br />
promote active fire behavior. Despite these factors, there was no growth on the Upper Lime Creek Fireand <br />
minimal growth on the Summit Trail Fire. Firefighters made good progress strengthening fire lines using heavy <br />
equipment, hand crews and burning operations.<br />
<br />
The excessive heat warning that was set to expire last evening has been extended through 8 p.m. on Sunday. <br />
A Red Flag Warning is posted for gusty winds and low humidity in the area, which may create dangerous fire <br />
conditions from 11 a.m. until 8 p.m. on Sunday.<br />
<br />
Today, firefighters will continue mopping up around the 376-acre Upper Lime Creek Fire, with a focus on <br />
reinforcing fire lines on the east (downwind) side of the fire along Highway 21. The fire remains at 60 percent <br />
containment.  <br />
<br />
On the Summit Trail Fire, crews continue to strengthen fire lines. Structure protection and preparation in the <br />
Twin Lakes area is ongoing. If conditions allow, crews will conduct burning operations this morning. Burning <br />
operations will reduce unburned fuels and further reinforce current containment in advance of the Red Flag <br />
Warning.<br />
<br />
Summit Trail Evacuations: Level 1 (Advisory) evacuations are in place from Lafleur south on Hall Creek Rd. to <br />
Hall Creek Flat (including Lynx Creek Rd.), Seyler Valley Rd. south to Bridge Creek Rd., and along Bridge <br />
Creek Rd. (including Mollenberg Lane) to Twin Lakes. The Twin Lakes area is under a Level 1 evacuation as <br />
well. <br />
<br />
Upper Lime Creek Evacuations: Level 1 evacuations are in place for the Pines (Cache Creek Road) south to <br />
Bridge Creek Rd.<br />
<br />
Road Closures: Sitdown Creek Rd. is closed at County Highway 99. Some recreation and parking areas may <br />
be closed to public access.  Expect delays and please use caution when driving through the fire areas as <br />
firefighters may be working along the roadways. <br />
<br />
Closures: The Colville Reservation, closed to the general public, has an Industrial Fire Precaution Level IV <br />
(General Shutdown), which closes all forest roads to the public. State and county improved roads (with a <br />
paved or gravel surface) remain open. For more information about the Colville Indian Tribes, visit <br />

IInchelium, WA – The Summit Trail Fire was started by lightning on July 12, and is burning on the Colville <br />
Reservation approximately 17 miles west of Inchelium.  The Upper Lime Creek Fire, started by lightning on <br />
August 4, is also burning on the Colville Reservation approximately 6 miles north of Keller. Both fires are <br />
being managed by Northwest Incident Management Team 10, with 471 personnel engaged in fighting the <br />
fires.<br />
<br />
Poor air quality persisted through Saturday as heavy smoke from fires in Washington and British Columbia <br />
impacted the region, and decreased visibility kept aircraft from flying. Hot and dry weather continues to <br />
promote active fire behavior. Despite these factors, there was no growth on the Upper Lime Creek Fireand <br />
minimal growth on the Summit Trail Fire. Firefighters made good progress strengthening fire lines using heavy <br />
equipment, hand crews and burning operations.<br />
<br />
The excessive heat warning that was set to expire last evening has been extended through 8 p.m. on Sunday. <br />
A Red Flag Warning is posted for gusty winds and low humidity in the area, which may create dangerous fire <br />
conditions from 11 a.m. until 8 p.m. on Sunday.<br />
<br />
Today, firefighters will continue mopping up around the 376-acre Upper Lime Creek Fire, with a focus on <br />
reinforcing fire lines on the east (downwind) side of the fire along Highway 21. The fire remains at 60 percent <br />
containment.  <br />
<br />
On the Summit Trail Fire, crews continue to strengthen fire lines. Structure protection and preparation in the <br />
Twin Lakes area is ongoing. If conditions allow, crews will conduct burning operations this morning. Burning <br />
operations will reduce unburned fuels and further reinforce current containment in advance of the Red Flag <br />
Warning.<br />
<br />
Summit Trail Evacuations: Level 1 (Advisory) evacuations are in place from Lafleur south on Hall Creek Rd. to <br />
Hall Creek Flat (including Lynx Creek Rd.), Seyler Valley Rd. south to Bridge Creek Rd., and along Bridge <br />
Creek Rd. (including Mollenberg Lane) to Twin Lakes. The Twin Lakes area is under a Level 1 evacuation as <br />
well. <br />
<br />
Upper Lime Creek Evacuations: Upper Lime Creek Evacuations: Level 1: From Empire Ck. to The Pines.<br />
<br />
Road Closures: Sitdown Creek Rd. is closed at County Highway 99. Some recreation and parking areas may <br />
be closed to public access.  Expect delays and please use caution when driving through the fire areas as <br />
firefighters may be working along the roadways. <br />
<br />
Closures: The Colville Reservation, closed to the general public, has an Industrial Fire Precaution Level IV <br />
(General Shutdown), which closes all forest roads to the public. State and county improved roads (with a <br />
paved or gravel surface) remain open. For more information about the Colville Indian Tribes, visit <br />

As of early yesterday the Walker Creek and Spur fires have merged and will now be managed as one fire, <br />
referred to as the Walker Creek Fire. Acreages shown are the combined acreages for the Walker Creek and <br />
former Spur fires.<br />
Walker Creek Fire: A RED FLAG WARNING is in effect today for low humidities and gusty winds from the <br />
west and southwest. Fire behavior is expected to be active today. Crews will be strongly focusing on structure <br />
protection and strategically placing resources around the fire area in anticipation of today’s fire behavior. <br />
Structure protection will continue in the area of the Boy Scout camp and east of the Bonaparte Lake Road. On <br />
the southeast side crews will be doing further structure protection and patrolling for spot fires along the Bunch <br />
Road. Overnight, additional structure protection was done in the Walker Lake area and day shift crews will <br />
continue that work today. On the southwest side of the fire crews will be patrolling the south side of the 3230 <br />
road for spot fires. Fireline construction and improvement will be done to tie in to the Bonaparte Lake Road <br />
from the 3230 road. <br />
A number of communities have had their evacuation levels changed. Please refer to the Okanogan County, <br />
WA  county wide advisory map for updated changes. <br />
Chickadee Creek Fire: Little to no growth occurred as crews continue to use engine crews and some heavy <br />
equipment to enforce the line. In addition, they will patrol for spot fires outside containment lines. Personnel <br />
will continue to look for hot spots and assist where needed. <br />

(Klamath Falls, OR) – A Type 3 incident management organization will assume command of Bootleg Fire from <br />
the Pacific Northwest Incident Management Team 2 on Saturday, August 14 at 6:00 a.m. In total, eight <br />
Incident <br />

<br />
On Thursday afternoon, firefighters and helicopters from the Bootleg Fire provided assistance with two new <br />
fires <br />
in the area. The Patton Meadow is approximately 2,000 acres on the Fremont-Winema-Forest west of <br />
Lakeview <br />
and the Willow Valley fire is on the Bureau of Land Management’s Lakeview District south of Bonanza at <br />
approximately 220 acres. Both the Patton Meadow and Willow Valley fires have numerous air and ground <br />
wildland firefighting resources engaging, with more firefighting resources ordered. For more information about <br />
the Patton Meadow Fire, visit https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/7798/.<br />
<br />
As the Type 3 incident management organization continues to manage the Bootleg Fire, five fire engines and <br />
additional personnel will remain to patrol the fire area and assist with any new fires in the area. The Oregon <br />
Department of Forestry will assume management of the Yainax and Walrus Fires effective Saturday, August <br />
14 at <br />
6:00 a.m.<br />
<br />
“It has been an honor to work with the local, regional, and national cooperators on this incident,” said Incident <br />
Commander Rob Allen. “We are grateful for the support we’ve received from the local community. Every bit of <br />
it <br />
helped our firefighters contain this large fire under challenging circumstances.”<br />

 <br />
he Whitmore Fire is located on the Colville Reservation south of Omak Lake and west of Nespelem, WA. The <br />
Incident Command Post at Nespelem Community Center is closed to all but essential personnel to help <br />
ensure the health and safety of community members and firefighters.<br />
<br />
There is a Red Flag Warning today from 1 PM to 11 PM for gusty westerly winds combined with low relative <br />
humidity. The excessive heat warning remains in effect until 8 PM tonight for dangerously hot conditions with <br />
afternoon temperatures in the upper 90s to 103. These conditions will further test the fire containment lines, <br />
but no fire growth is expected beyond the current footprint.<br />
<br />
SIZE:  58,265 acres<br />
CONTAINMENT: 45%<br />
PERSONNEL: 372<br />
CAUSE: Lightning<br />
RESOURCES:<br />
Hand Crews: 7<br />
Engines: 25<br />
Dozers: 5<br />
Water Tenders: 17<br />
Helicopters: 1<br />
Fixed Wing: 1<br />
<br />
Operations<br />
The Red Flag conditions today have the potential to cause flare ups and spot fires from remaining heat <br />
sources, so fire crews will be on the lookout and will quickly respond to any uptick in fire behavior resulting <br />
from the dry and gusty winds. Containment lines around the fire remain secure and firefighters will remain <br />
vigilant given today’s conditions.<br />
<br />
Yesterday, firefighters patrolled and continued mop-up work around the fire perimeter. Fire crews will continue <br />
mop-up along the northern and eastern flanks of the fire. In areas of recent burnout on the northern edge of <br />
the fire, fire crews will be “gridding” today as they search for any remaining small fires by systematically <br />
walking over the area along parallel lines. Firefighters will also begin repairing the control lines created during <br />
fire suppression in the southeast portion of the fire.<br />
<br />
Evacuations<br />
Level 2 evacuations remain in place through the Red Flag Warning period for the Columbia River Road <br />
corridor, Kartar Valley, Colville Agency, the community of Nespelem, and the SR155 corridor from Colville <br />
Agency north up to the Mission. Call Tribal Police at (509) 634-2472 with all evacuation questions.<br />
<br />
Traffic and Road Closures<br />
Coyote Creek Road remains closed.<br />
<br />
The Omak Stampede is ending today, and heavy traffic is expected this afternoon along the SR155 corridor. <br />
Please use extra caution driving, as fire equipment accesses the northern portion of the fire from SR155 and <br />
will be entering and exiting side roads.</span>

Current Status: The fire is in full mop-op mode, and crews are continuing to monitor the perimeter for hot <br />
spots, completing mop-op where those spots presented a threat to control lines. Fire behavior is minimal and <br />
smoldering, but no active fire behavior has been observed. There is no anticipated change in the fire spread. <br />
Terrain within the burned area is steep and largely inaccessible, and smokejumpers assisted suppression <br />
efforts earlier in the week. Ground crews remain onsite. The fire is being managed jointly with the Schneider <br />
Springs Fire on the Naches Ranger District to the southwest, and some resources that were on the Windy <br />
Pass Fire have now been reassigned to assist suppression efforts in that area.<br />
<br />
Weather: High temperatures and low RH value are currently in the forecast through the day. A cold front <br />
passing through this morning will bring high wind gusts. An Excessive Heat Warning is in effect for today <br />
through 8:00 p.m. Closures:  The Forest Service has issued Closure Order 06-17-03-21-15 for the Taneum <br />

(Klamath Falls, OR) – A Type 3 incident management organization will assume command of Bootleg Fire from <br />
the Pacific Northwest Incident Management Team 2 on Saturday, August 14 at 6:00 a.m. In total, eight <br />
Incident <br />

<br />
On Thursday afternoon, firefighters and helicopters from the Bootleg Fire provided assistance with two new <br />
fires <br />
in the area. The Patton Meadow is approximately 2,000 acres on the Fremont-Winema-Forest west of <br />
Lakeview <br />
and the Willow Valley fire is on the Bureau of Land Management’s Lakeview District south of Bonanza at <br />
approximately 220 acres. Both the Patton Meadow and Willow Valley fires have numerous air and ground <br />
wildland firefighting resources engaging, with more firefighting resources ordered. For more information about <br />
the Patton Meadow Fire, visit https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/7798/.<br />
<br />
As the Type 3 incident management organization continues to manage the Bootleg Fire, five fire engines and <br />
additional personnel will remain to patrol the fire area and assist with any new fires in the area. The Oregon <br />
Department of Forestry will assume management of the Yainax and Walrus Fires effective Saturday, August <br />
14 at <br />
6:00 a.m.<br />
<br />
“It has been an honor to work with the local, regional, and national cooperators on this incident,” said Incident <br />
Commander Rob Allen. “We are grateful for the support we’ve received from the local community. Every bit of <br />
it <br />
helped our firefighters contain this large fire under challenging circumstances.”<br />
