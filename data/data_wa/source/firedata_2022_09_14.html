Update: The Bolt Creek Fire started on Saturday, September 10, 2022, at 5:15 am near Beckler Road. The cause of the fire is <br />
undetermined. Northwest Incident Management Team 8, Incident Commander Kevin Stock, assumed management of the fire from <br />
Western Washington Incident Management Team 3 this morning. Team 8 appreciates all the hard work completed by firefighters and <br />
Western WA Team on this fire to date.<br />
<br />
Yesterday, the fire was moderately active and backing downhill toward the Highway 2 corridor. <br />
Individual small columns of smoke were visible from Highway 2. The fire remained north of Highway 2 except at the Money Creek <br />
Tunnel where fire burned directly on top of the tunnel. Visibility was adequate to safely launch a heavy helicopter to provide water <br />
bucket drops to check the fire spread. The fire has burned down to the highway in multiple locations and firefighters worked along the <br />
highway to prevent the fire from crossing. Firefighters completed structure protection in Baring and Grotto by creating defensible space <br />
and installing hose lays to protect buildings if fire moves into the area. Night shift firefighters tactically applied fire on either side of the <br />
Money Creek Tunnel on Highway 2 to provide a secured black line to the highway. <br />
<br />
Night shift firefighters also patrolled and monitored the fire for any flare-ups.Today, additional firefighting resources are arriving to work <br />
on the fire. Heavy <br />
equipment including feller bunchers, masticators, and chippers will be utilized to clear brush and fuels along roads that will be used as <br />
primary or alternate fire <br />
lines. Firefighters will work along Forest Service Road (FSR) 6510 and Beckler Road removing fuels to use as a holding feature on the <br />
east edge of the fire. FSR 6022 (Heybrook Lookout Road) from Highway 2 to the Index-Galena Road along the west fire perimeter will <br />
also be prepared as a holding line. Night shift will continue to provide patrols and monitor fire activity.Weather and Behavior: Conditions <br />
today will be cooler with temperature 58-64°F, minimum relative humidity near 87%, and excellent humidity recovery overnight. Winds <br />
will be light becoming northwest at 5-6 mph in the afternoon. There is a slight chance of thunderstorms this afternoon and evening, <br />
mainly to the east.<br />
<br />
Fuels remain dry and the fire will move primarily where wind and slopes align in steep terrain. The fire is still capable of large runs if <br />
winds increase above 25 mph. However, high winds are not currently predicted. Fine fuel moistures are increasing as moisture and <br />
relative humidity increase.</span>

Summary: The Boulder Mountain Fire was detected on Wednesday August 31st, 2022, at approximately 6:00 pm. The fire is located in <br />
the Tacoma Creek and Boulder Mountain area, 9 miles Northwest of Cusick, Washington. A mix of State, Federal and Private land is <br />
impacted. The terrain is difficult, and the fire is burning in heavy timber, slash, and beetle infested trees. Cause of the fire remains under <br />
investigation. <br />
<br />
Weather|Anticipated Fire Behavior: Smoke continues to blanket most of Washington and Oregon from the numerous fires in the region. <br />
Air quality will once again be in the unhealthy range. Rain is possible for the afternoon with a chance of thunderstorms in the evening. <br />
While rain is always welcome, it will provide only a temporary relief to fire behavior until a significant event occurs due to the dry heavy <br />
fuels. A wind shift from the southwest has the potential to reduce the potential for spotting on the southern edge of the fire. <br />
<br />
Actions: Firefighters continue to make good progress on the northern and eastern sides of the fire and containment is now at 34%.  A <br />
benchmark was reached yesterday with control lines now encircling the entire fire area, crews will continue to penetrate deeper into the <br />
burn area to target hot spots. Current control lines are a mix of both dozer and hand lines. Crews continue to expand and improve lines <br />
daily. Yesterday, wind from the north and very dry fuels kept resources quite busy on the southern edge. Spot fires were persistent <br />
throughout the day. Despite not having aviation support, due to poor visibility, crews were able to respond and stay on top of most of the <br />
fire spread. Lines around the rest of the fire are holding well. <br />
<br />
Important Information: Expect poor air quality today.  For current air quality readings, check https://www.airnow.gov/.  AirNow <br />
recommends everyone reduce prolonged or heavy exertion and take more breaks during outdoor activities. Sensitive groups should <br />
avoid prolonged or heavy exertion and consider moving activities indoors or rescheduling. For a look at the fire and smoke map, visit <br />

The Lane County Sheriff’s Office lowered evacuation levels Monday to lift the entire Oakridge area from Level 3 (Go <br />
Now) to Level 2 (Set). Eastern Lane County, east of Waldo Lake and north of Waldo Lake Wilderness, and western Deschutes County <br />
remain at Level 3. Fire officials will continue to work with local law enforcement to communicate fire conditions and keep the community <br />
safe. People who have mobility limitations or are particularly sensitive to smoke are encouraged not to return to Level 2 areas. Those <br />
who choose to remain in shelters will continue to receive services provided by the Red Cross. Smoke continues to create unhealthy air <br />
quality, which will likely continue for several more days. Smoke is now impacting communities on the east side of the fire, particularly La <br />
Pine, Crescent Lake, Sun River, and Bend.  <br />
<br />
A virtual community meeting will be hosted by East Zone’s Alaska Team tonight (Tuesday) at 7 pm. Join us on Facebook to learn more <br />
and have your questions answered. <br />
<br />
West Zone Operations: Pacific Northwest Interagency Incident Management Team 3 led by Incident Commander Randy Johnson <br />
assumed command of the West Zone of the Cedar Creek Fire at 6:00 am Tuesday. The team will continue to coordinate firefighting <br />
operations with Oregon State Fire Marshal Team Red as well as the Alaska Incident Management Team managing the East Zone of the <br />
fire. <br />
<br />
The fire remains active and crews were engaged all around the West Zone perimeter with improving fire lines along roads and <br />
constructed hand and equipment line. As the sky began to clear on the West Zone Monday afternoon, air operations was able to fly <br />
reconnaissance missions to determine where fire growth occurred, verify containment lines, and look for opportunities for increasing <br />
containment. The fire was actively burning and was most active on the south side of Salmon Creek. <br />
<br />
Tuesday, firefighters will continue to improve and prepare roads to be used as containment line. The fire is backing down toward <br />
containment lines. Crews are preparing roads to be used as fireline including Forest Roads 19, 2409, 5871, and 5853. The light <br />
precipitation had limited impact to fire behavior and crews are maintaining their momentum in suppression efforts during this window of <br />
opportunity. <br />
<br />
East Zone Operations: Operations in the East Zone focus on a containment strategy by strengthening existing or natural barriers. Fire <br />
crews remove fuels to create contingency line to protect communities, structures, and other values. The active fire edge with heavy <br />
fuels, high concentrations of snags, flammable lichens, and down dead trees is dangerous for firefighters. They engage directly on the <br />
fire when conditions are safe to do so. Air operations assist their efforts by dropping water or retardant to slow the fire’s progression. <br />
Recent heavy smoke has grounded aircraft, but these operations will resume as conditions allow. <br />
<br />
Crews remove fuels along existing roads to improve them as a fire barrier. Along the west side of the Cascade Lakes Highway, crews <br />
are using heavy equipment to remove vegetation to create a shaded fuel break. Most of the flammable vegetation is removed, but trees <br />
remain, distanced about 40 feet from each other. Crews are brushing forest roads to create a stronger barrier to potential fire spread. In <br />
the southeastern edge of the fire, Forest Road 5896 on the north side of Odell Lake and Forest Road 4668 east to Davis Lake are <br />
being prepped. On the east edge of the fire area, south of Little Cultus Lake, two miles have been cleared along Forest Road 4290. A <br />
taskforce with the Oregon State Fire Marshal Office will be conducting tactical patrols near Crescent Lake and coordinating with local <br />
fire resources.</span>

Sedro Woolley, WA – Weather conditions along with dry fuels continue to increase fire activity on the lightning-caused Chilliwack <br />
Complex. Increased easterly winds, high temperatures, and low humidity throughout the area have prompted a Red Flag Warning from <br />
the National Weather Service through Sunday evening. On Friday, the Copper Lake and Copper Ridge fires merged, and the North <br />
Fork and Little Chill fires merged. The two fires are now known as Copper Lake and Little Chill fires, respectively. The Silesia Fire had <br />
significant growth and is approximately one mile from the forest boundary with the Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest. This fire <br />
activity has prompted the closure of the Silesia Creek Trail. The Chilliwack Complex is made up of several active fires (Little Chill, <br />
Copper Lake, Brush Creek, Silesia, and Little Beaver Creek).<br />
<br />
 Crews continue protection measures on a pack bridge and suspension bridge near the Brush Creek Fire and on the cable car <br />
potentially threatened by the Copper Lake Fire. Firefighters continue to utilize helicopter bucket work on the Little Beaver Creek Fire.<br />
<br />
<br />
The Washington Department of Ecology announced an Air Quality Alert due to current wildfire smoke from the fires in the North <br />
Cascades. North and northeasterly winds are moving into the area, pushing regional smoke impacts from fires into the greater <br />
Bellingham-Seattle metropolitan area. Increasing smoke impacts, reduced visibility and short periods of UNHEALTHY air quality are <br />
expected into Sunday. As southwest winds return late Sunday, smoke impacts will shift back into the Wenatchee, Chelan, and <br />
Okanogan valleys. Take precautions when recreating outdoors when heavy smoke is present. Learn more at Real-Time Air Quality Map <br />
| PurpleAir, airnow.gov or visit https://wasmoke.blogspot.com/.  <br />
  <br />
Trail and camp closures remain in effect due to fire activity. Closure information can be found at <br />
https://www.nps.gov/noca/planyourvisit/trail-conditions.htm  <br />

Weather: Today will have increased chance of thunderstorms. Gusty and erratic winds are likely near developing storm cells. <br />
Temperatures will be in the upper-70s, and the minimal relative humidity will be near 30 percent. Winds will be light, except near storm <br />
cells. Widespread smoke haze will be visible throughout the area.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Operations: Yesterday crews continued suppression repairs along FSR 45, including chipping and spreading bales of straw. The straw <br />
will help reduce erosion by covering bare ground and slowing water run-off. Several hand crews worked closely with resource advisors <br />
scattering fuels and constructing water bars along containment lines. Today several excavators will begin suppression repairs along <br />
FSR 4555 and near Indian Rock Lookout. The excavators will be used to help spread heavy fuels, construct water bars and smooth out <br />
mounds of debris and dirt. <br />
<br />
<br />
Closures and Evacuations:  There are no county evacuation alerts, and County Road 20 (Middle Fork Road) is open to all motorists.</span>

Highlights: Firefighters completed containment lines around the spot fire on the west side of the Imnaha River. Higher relative humidity, <br />
cooler temperatures, and light winds are forecast for the rest of the week, and firefighters feel confident the containment lines will limit <br />
further fire growth in that area. Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS), or drones, and infrared flights flew last night to check for heat <br />
around the spot fire. Oregon State Fire Marshal (OSFM) task forces have completed their structure preparation and protection <br />
operations and will demobilize today.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Double Creek Fire: 155,297 acres | 15% contained |861 personnel assigned  <br />
<br />
The lightning caused Double Creek Fire is a full suppression fire, and the protection of lives and property remain the primary objectives <br />
of this incident. Firefighters engaged in direct and indirect firefighting tactics to complete a containment line around the spot fire on the <br />
west bank of the Imnaha River yesterday. Firefighters and OSFM worked to complete structure protection efforts in the River Woods <br />
subdivision. Firefighters used jetboats on the Snake River to reassess structure protection efforts for values along the west side of the <br />
river yesterday and will continue those efforts today. On the south end of the fire, crews will work towards building direct line to the <br />
wilderness to stop fire spread further south. Firefighters will assess the containment line around the spot fire and mop up and areas <br />
continuing to hold heat near the containment lines. Much of the Imnaha corridor is in patrol status, and firefighters will remain present to <br />
address any threats to existing control features. On the north end of the fire, crews continue to strengthen and improve an east-west <br />
line using dozers and handline to minimize fire growth further north.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Eagle Cap Wilderness Fires  <br />
<br />
There are three lightning caused fires within the Eagle Cap Wilderness. The Nebo, Sturgill, and Goat Mountain 2 Fires are being <br />
managed to protect public and private infrastructure, while playing a natural role within designated Wilderness.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Nebo Fire: 12,365 acres | 0% contained | 56 personnel assigned<br />
<br />
Firefighters continued chipping along the 39 Road yesterday to remove potential fuel. Crews assessed the need to improve dozer and <br />
handlines yesterday. Firefighters from the Nebo Fire assisted with the effort to contain the spot fire on the Double Creek Fire. Today, <br />
chipping and road improvement work will continue on the 39 Road, as will work to improve dozer line on the north side of the fire.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Sturgill Fire: 19,774 acres | 0% contained | 78 personnel assigned <br />
<br />
Once rappelers completed structure protection efforts at the Bear Creek Guard Station yesterday, they were flown out of the area to <br />
assist in other priority areas. Smokejumpers completed structure protection on the Stanley Guard Station and will be flown out as the <br />
flying conditions improve today. Additional resources, including several hot shot crews and a wildland fire module, will be flown out of <br />
the area beginning today. Crews and heavy equipment will remain in the Lostine corridor to continue masticating fuels and creating a <br />
shaded fuel break over the next week.   <br />
<br />
<br />
Goat Mountain 2 Fire: 531 acres | 0% contained | 0 personnel assigned<br />
<br />
Fire activity on the Goat Mountain 2 Fire has been minimal. Firefighters will continue to monitor the fire by air as smoke and weather <br />
permit.</span>

Overview: The fire is burning 1.5 miles northeast of the town of Packwood, Washington. Suppression efforts continue to be challenged <br />
by steep rugged terrain in dense stands of timber in the Goat Rocks Wilderness. Public and firefighter safety remain the highest priority <br />
on the Goat Rocks Fire.<br />
<br />
Community Meeting:On Wednesday September 14, beginning at 7:00 p.m. there will be a meeting held at the Packwood Community <br />
Center, and broadcast on the Gifford Pinchot National Forest Facebook page. Fire officials will update the public on the current fire <br />
situation on the Goat Rocks Fire.<br />
<br />
Fire Activity:Yesterday, crews finished prepping structures in Timberline and moved on to other areas along US-12. With the continued <br />
fire spread to the south, crews began prepping the 1266 road system to the south and the 46 road system to the north of the fire. Due <br />
to the moderated fire activity, firefighters did not observe any new growth.<br />
<br />
Today, resources will continue structure prep in the Coal Creek area and patrol the Timberline neighborhood. Work will continue along <br />
the 1266 and 46 road systems, clearing edges to create a fuel break ahead of the fire. Additionally, crews will be wrapping the historic <br />
structures at Packwood Lake with a protective covering in the event the fire reaches that location.<br />
<br />
Forest Closures: US Hwy-12 and Highway 123 are both now open for traffic in both directions, but fire managers are asking the public <br />
to exercise caution on the roads as fire vehicles and personnel are operating in the area. Forest Roads 1260, 1262, 1266, 4600, 4610, <br />
4612, 4830 and all connected spur roads remain closed. Additionally, #65 (Bluff Lake), #69 (Three Peaks), #74 (Pipeline Road), #61 <br />
(Clear Fork Trail from the trailhead to the Clear Lost Trail), #76 (Clear Lost Trail from the junction of the Clear Fork Trail to the junction <br />
of the Packwood Lake Trail), and #78 (Packwood Lake Trail) are closed. Hikers can continue to access the Clear Lost Trailhead, but <br />
can only hike south on the Clear Fork Trail.<br />
<br />
Evacuations: All of Packwood and its surrounding communities except for Upper Timberline are at an Evacuation Level 1 (Be Ready). <br />
Upper Timberline is now at an Evacuation Level 2 (Be Set). The evacuation shelter at White Pass School is now closed.<br />
<br />
Fire Restrictions: Campfire bans and other use restrictions are in place across the Gifford Pinchot National Forest and much of the <br />
region. Campfires are allowed within certain campgrounds on an approved list at: https://www.fs.usda.gov/alerts/giffordpinchot/alerts-<br />
notices<br />
<br />
Weather: The rainfall we received yesterday morning was very beneficial. The increased moisture that came in along with that rain <br />
helped to reduce overall fire activity. The onshore flow that began yesterday will continue through the remainder of the week, bringing in <br />
cool temperatures and higher humidity. There is a chance for more precipitation later in the week.<br />
<br />
Public Safety:  Firefighters and apparatus are working on and around the area roadways. You can help keep firefighters and the public <br />
safe by driving carefully and by adhering to the closure orders until they are officially lifted. <br />
<br />
Sign-up For Alerts:To receive alerts from Lewis County in the case of an emergency, please sign up for Lewis County alerts at <br />
https://lewiscountywa.gov/departments/emergency-management/lewis-county-alert/</span>

Plain, WA – Lightning started the White River and Irving Peak Fires on August 11th. The Minnow Ridge Fire cause is currently <br />
undetermined. These fires <br />
are burning on the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest.<br />
<br />
Suppression Strategy – Due to rugged and steep terrain, fire managers continue to implement a long-term strategy to manage these <br />
fires, including the <br />
use of primary and contingency perimeter lines for containment. Tactics include completion and reinforcement of fire lines utilizing forest <br />
roads and <br />
constructed hand line.<br />
<br />
Current Situation – A local Type 3 Incident Management Team assumed command of the fires on September 7th and is currently <br />
managing the White <br />
River, Irving Peak, Meander, and now Minnow Ridge fires. The Meander Fire is 6 acres with very minimal fire activity. Smoke may be <br />
visible over the next <br />
several weeks as interior fuels continue to smolder and burn out, and multiple fires burn region-wide.<br />
<br />
White River Fire – Acres: 2,577 (as of 9/9/2022); 1% contained; Location: Sears Creek area of the White River drainage, approximately <br />
14 miles NW of <br />
Plain, WA.<br />
Fire growth primarily occurred on the south flanks of the fire. The fire footprint remains within the control lines and geographic features <br />
being utilized as <br />
containment lines. Firefighters continue to establish an anchor point, monitor activity, and maintain structure protection along Sears <br />
Creek Road and <br />
Windmill Lane.<br />
<br />
Irving Peak Fire – Acres: 3,226 (as of 9/9/2022); 7% contained; Location: Approximately 16 miles NW of Plain, WA<br />
The Irving Peak Fire has seen minimal growth over the last few days. Firefighters continue to improve roads used as containment lines, <br />
utilize strategic <br />
firing to establish control lines, and monitor fire activity.<br />
<br />
Minnow Ridge Fire – Acres: approximately 350; 0% contained; Location: Chikamin Ridge, approximately 14 miles N of Plain, WA.<br />
Minimal fire activity was seen yesterday. Fire resources continue preparation work around structures in the Chiwawa River area. <br />
Firefighters are scouting <br />
fire lines previously utilized during past wildfire activity to determine if they may be beneficial to the current strategy.</span>

						    <span class="textarea">Increased fire activity on some of the lightning caused fires, burning in the very remote, steep, and inaccessible terrain in the northwest <br />
corner of the Pasayten Wilderness Area, spurred trail and area closures over the holiday weekend. Hot, dry, and windy conditions are <br />
expected today as a trough moves into the area which is expected to create conditions for increased fire behavior. The Shull, The <br />
Parks, Kid, Three Fools, Skagit, and Elbow fires, located near the Canadian-U.S border, are expected to grow in acreage today.<br />
<br />
In a joint delegation with the National Park Service, a National Incident Management Organization Team, NIMO Team 2, assumed <br />
command yesterday over the six fires now being called the NW Pasayten Fires, located in the Pasayten Wilderness on the Methow <br />
Valley Ranger District of the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest, as well as the Chilliwack Complex Fires within the North Cascades <br />
National Park Service Complex.<br />
<br />
A number of closures are in effect including an area closure for the Freezeout Creek basin and a number of trails and portions of trails <br />
in the area. Portions of both the Pacific Crest Trail and Pacific Northwest Trail remain closed at this time.<br />
<br />
Smoke from these fires, and other fires burning in the region, may impact north central Washington communities over the next few <br />
days. Take precautions when recreating outdoors when heavy smoke is present. Learn more at Real-Time Air Quality Map | PurpleAir, <br />
airnow.gov or visit https://wasmoke.blogspot.com/.<br />
<br />
Update on individual NW Pasayten Fires:<br />
•     The Kid Fire, located on the ridge between Rock Creek and West Fork Pasayten, is approximately 8 miles south of the Canadian-<br />
U.S. border. The fire has been very active with spotting and torching of grouped trees. Yesterday, smokejumpers worked on protection <br />
of the historic airport cabin, situated about one quarter mile away from the Kid Fire, utilizing pumps and sprinklers. If conditions allow, <br />
smokejumpers will also be burning out unburned brush between the fire and the cabin.<br />
•     The Parks Fire is also very active. It crossed the border into Canada a couple of days ago. There is a Canadian Incident <br />
Management Team assigned to the Canadian portion (called the Heather Fire north of the border) of the Parks Fire. The fire is about <br />
one half mile from the Monument 83 Fire Lookout at the time of this release. Firefighters have prepared the lookout by wrapping the <br />
base with fire protective wrap.<br />
•    The Skagit Fire, located in Freezeout Creek 6 miles south of the border, spread northward and crossed over the top of the ridge and <br />
down the other side.<br />
•     Three Fools Fire, located 8 miles south of the border, is actively backing down the ridge and through an old burn scar, it has spotted <br />
north of the ridge. <br />
•     The Elbow Fire, located 6 miles south of the border, is actively backing down the slope near Skagit Peak.<br />
•     Tuesday, fire activity increased on the Shull Fire located 11 miles south of the border.</span>

<br />
MERLIN, Ore. – Monday was another quiet day on the Rum Creek Fire, with no increase in size and containment rising to 80%. The <br />
light rain Sunday night and Monday morning helped cool the fire, reducing the amount of residual heat. Today, fire personnel continue <br />
to patrol the fire’s perimeter, finding scattered hot spots and extinguishing them. They are also pulling hose lays and other surplus <br />
equipment, and hauling them back to camp near Merlin. <br />
<br />
The primary fire lines around the fire are holding, with no heat found outside them for several days. In areas where the Rum Creek Fire <br />
is contained, contingency lines constructed as a “catcher’s mitt” around the fire are no longer needed. The contingency lines are a <br />
combination of dozer lines and roads. They are being assessed for repair, stabilization and erosion prevention needs, and excess <br />
woody debris will be removed. <br />
<br />
As part of the repair process, dozer lines are usually waterbarred to reduce erosion. Waterbar drainage dips help intercept water and <br />
direct it off of erodible soils onto stable surfaces like unburned areas of the forest floor or piles of rocks or branches. Berms of soil and <br />
woody debris along the edges of dozer lines are pulled back onto the lines and smoothed. This returns the slope to a profile closer to <br />
the original shape and aids water dispersion.  <br />
<br />
Sometimes heavy equipment like an excavator will grab cut brush, limbs, and logs and scatter them over the exposed soils for <br />
additional erosion control. This dissipates the force of rain falling onto the soils, keeping more soil in place. This woody debris also <br />
helps catch seeds to revegetate the bare soil. <br />
<br />
Where roads are used as fire lines, fire crews frequently “prep” the roads by cutting brush, small trees crowded between other trees, <br />
and the lower limbs from trees adjacent to the road. The cut vegetation is usually carried across the road and stacked on the opposite <br />
side.  <br />
<br />
After a fire is contained, fire personnel dispose of these piles of woody materials as part of the repair process. Leaving the stacks in <br />
place can be unsightly and pose a fire hazard. A wood chipper is commonly used to reduce these piles into chips that are dispersed <br />
across the forest floor. The chips are less likely to burn than stacks of brush and limbs, and will rot quickly, adding nutrients to the soil. <br />
<br />
The public is reminded to drive carefully on roads near the fire, including Galice Road. Fire personnel are actively working on the fire, <br />
creating heavy traffic on some roads. If you don’t need to be in the fire area, please stay out. Avoid chipping operations. Please slow <br />
down, keep your eyes on the road, and yield to oversized vehicles.  <br />
<br />
Evacuations: Evacuation orders and notifications have not changed.  An interactive map showing evacuation levels according to <br />
address can be found at //JosephineCounty.gov/FireMap. For the most current evacuation information and resources, go to Josephine <br />
County Incident Information (rvem.org).  <br />
<br />
Road control: Josephine County Sheriff’s Office has established traffic access points around the fire zone. Road blocks are located at <br />
Galice Store; Bear Camp Road at Peavine (top intersection); Lower Grave Creek Road at Angora Creek (Grays Ranch); Quartz Creek <br />
Road about 3 miles up (end of County maintenance); Dutch Henry Road near Kelsey Creek (42 44'56.2/123 40'35.4); and Hog Creek at <br />
Galice Road. Only residents (must show proof of residency) and permitted users will be allowed through. <br />
<br />
River status: The Wild section of the Rogue River below Grave Creek will remain open unless fire conditions warrant closure. River <br />
status is determined on a day-to-day basis. Please call 541-471-6535 for more information regarding Rogue River permits. No new <br />
boating permits will be issued at this time.</span>

Containment has grown to 60 percent on the Van Meter Fire 13 miles southeast of Klamath Falls. Operations Section Chief Matt Flock <br />
shared with nightshift crews that there will be less resources assigned to night shift which means that things are ramping down.  He <br />
then reminded them that there was still work to be done in the southern section of the fire. The fire is in a good position on the northern <br />
divisions and crews are being moved to other priority areas around the fire.<br />
<br />
Pace and purpose are being preached to the firefighters as they enter full mop-up mode. Complacency can set in at this point in the fire <br />
where accidents are more likely to occur. With just two minor injuries recorded, this fire’s excellent safety record is a testament to <br />
firefighters’ attention to detail and situational awareness.<br />
<br />
Cooler weather, higher humidity and minimal wind have contributed to the success of mop-up operations and keeping the fire within the <br />
containment lines.  Palm IR cameras will continue to be used to identify hot spots near the fireline where containment lines can be <br />
compromised.<br />
<br />
Residential traffic is allowed in the fire area, but residents are encouraged to drive slowly and be aware of fire operation traffic as they <br />
travel through the fire. Bureau of Land Management lands in and around the fire area remain closed to the public.<br />
<br />
Evacuation levels have been lifted. For the latest up-to-date evacuation information, please visit the Klamath County Sheriff’s Office <br />
Facebook page at https://www.facebook.com/KlamathSheriff or call 541-205-9730.  The Red Cross Evacuation Shelter at the Klamath <br />
County Fair and Event Center has been closed.<br />
<br />
Due to the great work that has been completed, aviation resources were released and made available for higher priority fires around the <br />
state. Two local helicopters, based out of the ODF office, are available if needed for any flare ups and new fire starts. A Temporary <br />
Flight Restriction (TFR) exists around the fire to limit any aircraft not associated with firefighting activities in the airspace.  Wildfires are <br />
always a no-fly zone for drones.  A drone flying in the area can ground all operational aircraft and impact suppression activities.<br />
<br />
We would like to remind the public that although we received a small amount of rain yesterday, we are still in extreme fire danger. Fuels <br />
are still dry and receptive to fire. Please exercise caution when working or recreating in the outdoors. Also, visit <br />
https://www.oregon.gov/odf/fire/pages/restrictions.aspx for fire restrictions in your area or areas you plan to visit.</span>

September 12, 2022<br />
<br />
Plain, WA – Lightning started the White River and Irving Peak Fires on August 11th. The Minnow Ridge Fire cause is currently <br />
undetermined. These fires are <br />
burning on the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest.<br />
<br />
Suppression Strategy – Due to rugged and steep terrain, fire managers continue to implement a long-term strategy to manage these <br />
fires, including the use of <br />
primary and contingency perimeter lines for containment. Tactics include completion and reinforcement of fire lines utilizing forest roads <br />
and constructed hand <br />
line.<br />
<br />
Current Situation – A local Type 3 Incident Management Team assumed command of the fires on September 7th and is currently <br />
managing the White River, <br />
Irving Peak, Meander, and now Minnow Ridge fires. The Meander Fire is 6 acres with very minimal fire activity. Smoke may be visible <br />
over the next several <br />
weeks as interior fuels continue to smolder and burn out, and multiple fires burn region-wide.<br />
<br />
White River Fire – Acres: 2,577 (as of 9/9/2022); 1% contained; Location: Sears Creek area of the White River drainage, approximately <br />
14 miles NW of Plain, <br />
WA.<br />
Fire growth primarily occurred on the south flanks of the fire. The fire footprint remains within the control lines and geographic features <br />
being utilized as <br />
containment lines. Firefighters continue to establish an anchor point, monitor activity, and maintain structure protection along Sears <br />
Creek Road and Windmill <br />
Lane.<br />
<br />
Irving Peak Fire – Acres: 3,226 (as of 9/9/2022); 7% contained; Location: Approximately 16 miles NW of Plain, WA<br />
The Irving Peak Fire has seen minimal growth over the last few days. Firefighters continue to improve roads used as containment lines, <br />
utilize strategic firing <br />
to establish control lines, and monitor fire activity.<br />
<br />
Minnow Ridge Fire – Acres: approximately 350; 0% contained; Location: Chikamin Ridge, approximately 14 miles N of Plain, WA.<br />
Minimal fire activity was seen yesterday. Fire resources continue preparation work around structures in the Chiwawa River area. <br />
Firefighters are scouting fire <br />
lines previously utilized during past wildfire activity to determine if they may be beneficial to the current strategy.</span>
