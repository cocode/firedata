The Big Meadow Fire did not grow measurably during the past 24 hours. Firefighters made good progress on the <br />
fire yesterday, taking advantage of cooler weather and higher humidity to complete a combination of dozer and <br />
hand line on the eastern and southern flanks. <br />
<br />
Firefighters used helicopter water drops along the southern flank to suppress some hot spots. One spot fire was <br />
detected outside the perimeter which was successfully controlled. On the northern flank near Upper Valley, crews <br />
patrolled and <br />
<br />
mopped up 100 feet inside the perimeter. On the east near Egypt Canyon, crews have established hose lays into <br />
the fire, into rugged terrain inaccessible to engines. <br />
<br />
On the south near Dry Mountain, firefighters will work to fell hazardous trees killed or weakened by fire that pose <br />
a risk to firefighters and could threaten the fireline. Crews will work to install hoses on the southern flank.<br />
<br />
Today the weather will be slightly cooler, slightly drier and the wind will be calm. A light helicopter will be used on <br />
the fire for aerial reconnaissance. On the southern flank, crews will work on a burning operation to improve <br />
containment lines with a heavy helicopter assisting with water drops. Work will continue with fireline construction, <br />
improvement and mopping up around the fire perimeter.</span>

<br />
Yesterday, fire activity was moderated by higher humidity levels with surface fire, backing fire, and single tree <br />
torching observed along the northwest, north, and south sides of the fire. Areas of active fire remain in the Upper <br />
Dickey Creek, Mother Lode Creek, and Battle drainages on the north side and in the upper part of the East <br />
Humbug Creek drainage on the south side. On the south side firefighters mopped up along Forest Road 4696 <br />
where tactical firing actions were completed to keep up with fire movement several days ago. A chipper was used <br />
along Forest Road 4697 to dispose of slash and brush generated by line preparation. Engines patrolled and <br />
mopped up on the eastern side along Forest Road 6350 to keep the line secured. Fire crews patrolled the <br />
northeast corner and containment line searching for any hot spots or heat that could threaten the line. Equipment <br />
and crews prepared primary and contingency lines on road systems and hand lines north and northwest of the <br />
fire as part of the long-term fire suppression strategy.  <br />
<br />
Planned Actions: An active fire day is expected with low humidity levels however, winds are forecasted to be light <br />
so mostly surface fire with occasional group tree torching is expected. The fire in the Upper Dickey Creek, <br />
Mother Lode Creek, Pansey Creek, and Battle Creek drainages will continue to be the most active. Firefighters <br />
will work on primary lines along the south side to strengthen and enhance work done over the previous several <br />
days. Engine crews will patrol and monitor containment lines along the east and northeast sides of the fire. <br />
Heavy equipment will be used to prepare primary lines on road systems north and northwest of the fire.  <br />
<br />
Today is a transition or shadow day between the incoming and outgoing incident management teams. Command <br />
of the fire will be transferred to Northwest Team 13 at 6:00 am on Friday, September 17, 2021. The members of <br />
Northern Rockies Team 4 would like to thank the cooperators and community members for their cooperation and <br />
support over the past two weeks as we have worked to suppress this fire. <br />
<br />
Weather: The humidity recoveries were poor overnight resulting in drier conditions this morning, especially at the <br />
higher elevations. Temperatures will be 65-73 degrees, minimum humidity levels from 20% to 30%, and winds <br />
will be light from the east at 5-10 mph with gusts up to 15 mph. A high probability of rain is forecasted for the <br />
upcoming weekend. <br />
<br />
Temporary Flight Restriction (TFR): There is a TFR in place for air space over the Bull Complex (FDC 1-2073) to <br />
reduce impacts to fire aviation operations. Fire aviation response is halted or delayed if an unauthorized aircraft <br />
enters the TFR. Temporary flight restrictions also apply to unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) or drones. If you fly, <br />
we can’t! <br />
<br />
Evacuations:  The Marion County Sheriff has issued a Level 1 “Be Ready” evacuation advisory only for <br />
Breitenbush Hot Springs. Residents should be aware of the danger that exists in their area, monitor emergency <br />
services websites and local media, and make an action plan should the evacuation level rise. The advisory can <br />
be viewed at:  https://www.flashalert.net/id/MarionSheriff?alert=1.  <br />
<br />
Closures:  For the safety of wildland firefighters and the public, the National Forests have enacted area closures <br />
that prevent the public from being upon National Forest System lands in the vicinity of the Bull Complex Fire. All <br />
Forest lands that are south and west of Forest Road 46, and east of the Riverside Fire perimeter are closed. The <br />
entire length of Forest Road 46 is closed. Lands within the 2020 Lionshead and Beachie Creek Fire areas are <br />
also closed.  See the closure orders and maps at https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/closures/7773/.</span>

<br />
Cedar Creek, Cub Creek 2, and Delancy Fires September 10, 2021 Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest<br />
<br />
Minimal fire behavior occurred in the Cedar Creek Fire this week, with limited isolated creeping and some <br />
torching in the Varden Creek drainage and near Slate Lake.   On the Cub Creek 2 Fire, some creeping has been <br />
observed around the Farewell and Lake Creek vicinity. No activity was observed on the Delancy Fire. Cooler <br />
temperatures and higher humidities are expected across both fires this weekend, reducing the likelihood of active <br />
fire behavior and smoke production for the next few days.<br />
<br />
Crews and heavy equipment continue to complete suppression repair across both fire areas, repairing firelines, <br />
felling hazard trees along roads, chipping debris, and repairing roads damaged by suppression activity. The <br />
shortage of personnel and equipment nationally, plus the need to prioritize these resources for active fires with <br />
immediate suppression needs, have slowed the progress of this work on the Cedar Creek and Cub Creek 2 fires. <br />
<br />
Closure Area Update:<br />
<br />
In the Cedar Creek Fire area, the existing closure order remains unchanged for the next week. As of September <br />
10, the closure order for the Cub Creek 2 Fire has changed:<br />
<br />
·       Forest Service Roads 51 and 5160 (west of the Chewuch River) from Eightmile Ranch to Andrews Creek <br />
Trailhead are now open.<br />
<br />
·       Andrews Creek Trailhead and all trails leaving from this site are now open, including Andrews Creek, Little <br />
Andrews Creek, Coleman Ridge, and Fire Creek. Past Andrews Creek Trailhead, the road to Thirtymile Trailhead <br />
remains closed to allow for completion of road repair work that was scheduled for July but deferred because of <br />
fire activity. All other roads, trails, and trailheads in the existing closure order remain closed as crews continue to <br />
complete suppression repair and remove hazardous trees.<br />
<br />
·       Camp 4 Campground is now open.<br />
<br />
·       All other campgrounds, dispersed campsites, and trails in the Cub Creek 2 Fire closure area remain closed, <br />
including Falls Creek and Chewuch Campgrounds and the trail to Falls Creek Falls.<br />
<br />
Visit USFS Pacific Northwest Region Emergency Closures for locations and details of current closures. Fire <br />
closure orders and maps are also available here. As more suppression repair work is completed over the next <br />
week, district staff will re-assess the extent of closure orders across both fires to look for more opportunities to <br />
open areas and trails. Meanwhile, we appreciate your patience and respect for these closures to ensure the <br />
safety of our firefighters and visitors.<br />
<br />

<br />
Yesterday, on the Cougar Peak Fire, there was widespread active surface fire noted throughout the fire. Air <br />
resources assisted firefighters throughout the afternoon with bucket drops of water. On the southeast corner of <br />
the fire, a slop over the line was found early in the day and crews worked hard to contain it, stopping it at three <br />
acres. On the west-northwest side of the fire, the heavy equipment group made great progress prepping <br />
contingency line. The west side of the fire was more active than in days past as the effects of the rain diminish <br />
and the fire got more active within contingency lines. On the north end of the fire, cold trailing of the grass and <br />
sage fuels, mop-up and patrol continued with the northeast corner of the fire having more active fire than to the <br />
north. A helitack crew was flown into an inaccessible  area on the northeast corner yesterday afternoon to work <br />
the hotspots in the area. The eastern portion of the fire is plumbed, and firefighters continue to work diligently to <br />
mop-up and extinguish areas of heat.  <br />
<br />
A night shift remained out on the fire last night, patrolling and watching for flareups.  <br />
<br />
The Team Fire Behavior Analyst is calling today the “calm before the storm”. Today’s efforts will be the same as <br />
yesterday, continuing to strengthen the line with added mop-up depth around the fire. Timber falling teams have <br />
been removing many hazard trees. Firefighters remain vigilant watching for fire weakened trees and snags, as <br />
they remain a major safety concern, especially with the increase in winds forecasted for Friday and Saturday. <br />
<br />
Behavior: Overnight, some areas of active surface fire and occasional single tree torching were observed. Today, <br />
moderate intensity surface fire, single to small group torching with an increased probability of ignition is <br />
expected. Winds are predicted to be north-northeast less than 10 mph on the northern end of the fire. On the <br />
southern end of the fire, the winds will be light and terrain driven.</span>

Cedar Creek, Cub Creek 2, and Delancy Fires September 10, 2021 Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest<br />
<br />
Minimal fire behavior occurred in the Cedar Creek Fire this week, with limited isolated creeping and some <br />
torching in the Varden Creek drainage and near Slate Lake.   On the Cub Creek 2 Fire, some creeping has been <br />
observed around the Farewell and Lake Creek vicinity. No activity was observed on the Delancy Fire. Cooler <br />
temperatures and higher humidities are expected across both fires this weekend, reducing the likelihood of active <br />
fire behavior and smoke production for the next few days.<br />
<br />
Crews and heavy equipment continue to complete suppression repair across both fire areas, repairing firelines, <br />
felling hazard trees along roads, chipping debris, and repairing roads damaged by suppression activity. The <br />
shortage of personnel and equipment nationally, plus the need to prioritize these resources for active fires with <br />
immediate suppression needs, have slowed the progress of this work on the Cedar Creek and Cub Creek 2 fires. <br />
<br />
Closure Area Update:<br />
<br />
In the Cedar Creek Fire area, the existing closure order remains unchanged for the next week. As of September <br />
10, the closure order for the Cub Creek 2 Fire has changed:<br />
<br />
·       Forest Service Roads 51 and 5160 (west of the Chewuch River) from Eightmile Ranch to Andrews Creek <br />
Trailhead are now open.<br />
<br />
·       Andrews Creek Trailhead and all trails leaving from this site are now open, including Andrews Creek, Little <br />
Andrews Creek, Coleman Ridge, and Fire Creek. Past Andrews Creek Trailhead, the road to Thirtymile Trailhead <br />
remains closed to allow for completion of road repair work that was scheduled for July but deferred because of <br />
fire activity. All other roads, trails, and trailheads in the existing closure order remain closed as crews continue to <br />
complete suppression repair and remove hazardous trees.<br />
<br />
·       Camp 4 Campground is now open.<br />
<br />
·       All other campgrounds, dispersed campsites, and trails in the Cub Creek 2 Fire closure area remain closed, <br />
including Falls Creek and Chewuch Campgrounds and the trail to Falls Creek Falls.<br />
<br />
Visit USFS Pacific Northwest Region Emergency Closures for locations and details of current closures. Fire <br />
closure orders and maps are also available here. As more suppression repair work is completed over the next <br />
week, district staff will re-assess the extent of closure orders across both fires to look for more opportunities to <br />
open areas and trails. Meanwhile, we appreciate your patience and respect for these closures to ensure the <br />
safety of our firefighters and visitors.<br />
<br />

<br />
Wednesday’s favorable weather conditions and decreased fire behavior allowed firefighters to work directly on <br />
the fire perimeter as they completed fireline in several locations. This work advanced containment across the <br />
Smith Fire to 28% and Big Hamlin Fire to 89%. Heavy equipment connected the indirect line in Division A along <br />
Forest Road 27 to the Jack Fire. Across all divisions, work included firefighting resources constructing fireline, <br />
continuing to secure values at risk, patrolling, mopping up, extinguishing spot fires, and executing suppression <br />
repair.        <br />
<br />
Today, firefighters will build on yesterday’s successes working on further extension of firelines along the <br />
perimeter. Uncontained firelines remain the highest priority, and crews will continue working around values at <br />
risk. Firefighters will need to stay alert as today begins a drying trend where fire activity may reach levels <br />
equivalent to last Tuesday. Fire managers have predicted that fire is aligned on many south and southwestern <br />
slopes containing dead and down fuels, potentially allowing for uphill runs. Humidity in the 20-30% range will <br />
contribute to the active fire potential. Firefighters, heavy equipment, and chippers will continue working in and <br />
around Ash Valley to secure firelines around structures and remove vegetation debris.  In Division B, where <br />
Highway 28 preparations were finished, crews are prepared to conduct firing operations should defensive actions <br />
be warranted from elevated fire behavior. Indirect line reinforcement will continue in Divisions A and G and direct <br />
line will continue on uncontained firelines in Divisions H of the Big Hamlin and G and B of the Smith Fire.  Newly <br />
secured lines will be monitored to ensure the perimeters remain uncompromised, and suppression repair will <br />
continue on contained lines without heat.</span>

Yesterday: No spots observed. Areas that were burned out yesterday consumed nicely and created a<br />
buffer of black along control lines. Fire behavior was moderate as areas crept through unburned fuels<br />
with occasional torching. Winds more or less pushed smoke and backing edge inward towards the black.<br />
Firefighters continued to patrol, and mop up throughout the fire perimeter.<br />
<br />
Today: Firefighters will continue to focus on SW and SE with Direct Attack. Firefighters continue<br />
assessments further out and monitor and observe remote areas of southern perimeter. Firefighters<br />
continue to hold and improve completed lines to the west, continue to hold and improve completed lines<br />
to the south.<br />
<br />
Weather & Smoke Information:<br />
Sunny, with a high near 63. RH 27-29% Southwest wind around 10 mph becoming north in the afternoon.<br />
Overall, the westerly flow will continue through the week with chance of wetting rains by Friday and<br />
Saturday combined with cooler temperatures. Overall fuels conditions remain very dry and susceptible to<br />
fire spread. Will evaluate systems as they move through area but NO Season Ending type weather<br />
forecasted.</span>

<br />
Firefighting operations continue across all areas of the complex by applying a full suppression strategy. A dry <br />
warming trend continues to move over the fire area similar to yesterday with fire activity expected to pick up <br />
slightly earlier in the day. Modest to poor humidity recoveries are expected on the upper ridges with winds from <br />
the southeast and west. These elevated weather concerns will bring an increase in fire behavior but will also <br />
provide optimal burning conditions for continued controlled firing operations. Firing operations are expected to <br />
continue along the northeast side of the fires. These actions will create additional reinforcement to the north and <br />
east side of the fire, providing the greatest defense for the expected south winds on Friday prior to moisture <br />
moving into the area. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Chaos and Little Bend Fires:   <br />
<br />
The Chaos Fire is 26,284 acres and the Little Bend Creek Fire is 9,087 acres. Crews will continue conducting <br />
firing operations and connecting the ground to the east between the fire’s edge and the 3829 road. Arial ignitions <br />
were successful yesterday, consuming unburned fuels in open pocket areas near the fire’s perimeter which will <br />
also improve securing the perimeter from northerly growth. Firefighters tied direct hand line into the road and <br />
Horse Heaven Creek. This area continues to be the focus with the forecasted south winds on Friday. Today, <br />
firefighters will implement the plan to remove hazardous trees on the southeast corner of the Little Bend Fire by <br />
using explosives to safely remove hazard trees that cannot be removed with chainsaws or mechanical <br />
equipment. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Jack and Buckhead Fires:   <br />
<br />
The Jack Fire is 24,165 acres, and the Buckhead Fire is 6,925 acres.  Containment lines are holding on the west <br />
and north, and northeast perimeters. Yesterday’s warm weather did bring in increase in fire activity to the <br />
eastside of the Buckhead Fire. Firefighters will focus on this priority area along the southeast piece of the <br />
Buckhead Fire and continue to work areas south of the 2715 road. Today, fire crews will continue patrolling <br />
containment lines to identify and eliminate any previously undetected areas of heat.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Near Minky Fire:   <br />

Yesterday, crews continued to mop up and remove heavier 1000-hour fuels (dead wood 3 to 8 inches in <br />
diameter) near the fireline along the west and northwest perimeter of the fire. Additional firing operations were <br />
conducted along the southwest to secure the line near Helispot -13. Hose lays are being pulled out along <br />
contingency lines in Division M and backhauled to be cleaned, rolled and returned to the cache. With <br />
precipitation in the forecast, crews are constructing water bars on dozer and hand lines to help channel run-off <br />
and prevent erosion. More equipment will be arriving on site to speed up the process. <br />
<br />
Firefighters will continue to actively improve containment on the west flank of Gales Fire, south of Forest Road <br />
18. Crews will mop-up and hold recently completed burns, strengthening primary containment lines, on the NW <br />
(N USFS Rd 18 & Rd 1832) and the SW (USFS Rd 1824) flanks of the fire. Resources will be improving indirect <br />
lines on the east side of the fires and scouting for opportunities to move indirect lines closer to the main fire. <br />
Firing operations will be continuing in Division G and T as conditions allow. <br />
<br />
Weather: High pressure building back in overnight brought cool temperatures and poor humidity recovery levels <br />
to start the day. Expect dry conditions today along with lower relative humidity, but lighter winds. Elevated to <br />
near-critical fire weather is expected on Friday ahead of the precipitation, which is forecasted to arrive late in the <br />
day and overnight. Rainfall from ½ to ¾ of an inch is expected to continue into Saturday and Sunday. <br />
<br />
Smoke: Expect winds to be primarily terrain driven this morning, and smoke that settled in overnight will likely <br />
begin to dissipate by upslope/up valley wind movement later this morning. Smoke from the Bull Complex Fire will <br />
likely drift toward Bend and La Pine again today as was observed yesterday. <br />
<br />
Safety: Know how to prevent wildfires by properly using outdoor equipment, learning campfire safety, and <br />
checking for fire restrictions and closures. Please recreate responsibly! Learn more at <br />
https://www.recreateresponsibly.org. <br />
<br />
Closures: Hunting season is in effect and as such, please be sure to check all the area closures before heading <br />
out. Please visit https://www.fs.usda.gov/alerts/willamette/alerts-notices for information on additional closures <br />
and maps.</span>

<br />
Firefighting operations continue across all areas of the complex by applying a full suppression strategy. A dry <br />
warming trend continues to move over the fire area similar to yesterday with fire activity expected to pick up <br />
slightly earlier in the day. Modest to poor humidity recoveries are expected on the upper ridges with winds from <br />
the southeast and west. These elevated weather concerns will bring an increase in fire behavior but will also <br />
provide optimal burning conditions for continued controlled firing operations. Firing operations are expected to <br />
continue along the northeast side of the fires. These actions will create additional reinforcement to the north and <br />
east side of the fire, providing the greatest defense for the expected south winds on Friday prior to moisture <br />
moving into the area. <br />
<br />
Chaos and Little Bend Fires:   <br />
<br />
The Chaos Fire is 26,284 acres and the Little Bend Creek Fire is 9,087 acres. Crews will continue conducting <br />
firing operations and connecting the ground to the east between the fire’s edge and the 3829 road. Arial ignitions <br />
were successful yesterday, consuming unburned fuels in open pocket areas near the fire’s perimeter which will <br />
also improve securing the perimeter from northerly growth. Firefighters tied direct hand line into the road and <br />
Horse Heaven Creek. This area continues to be the focus with the forecasted south winds on Friday. Today, <br />
firefighters will implement the plan to remove hazardous trees on the southeast corner of the Little Bend Fire by <br />
using explosives to safely remove hazard trees that cannot be removed with chainsaws or mechanical <br />
equipment. <br />
<br />
Jack and Buckhead Fires:   <br />
<br />
The Jack Fire is 24,165 acres, and the Buckhead Fire is 6,925 acres.  Containment lines are holding on the west <br />
and north, and northeast perimeters. Yesterday’s warm weather did bring in increase in fire activity to the <br />
eastside of the Buckhead Fire. Firefighters will focus on this priority area along the southeast piece of the <br />
Buckhead Fire and continue to work areas south of the 2715 road. Today, fire crews will continue patrolling <br />
containment lines to identify and eliminate any previously undetected areas of heat.  <br />
<br />
Near Minky Fire:   <br />
<br />
The Near Minky Fire is at 4,869 acres. All containment lines are holding well, and there was no significant fire <br />
activity today. The Rocky Mountain Incident Management Team on the Devil’s Knob Complex is coordinating with <br />
the Great Basin Incident Management Team 2 to manage impacts from the nearby Smith Fire.   <br />

<br />
Yesterday and Overnight: Windy conditions did not result in unexpected fire activity. Firefighters and air <br />
resources focused suppression efforts where active fire is adjacent to communities in and around Cliffdell, Goose <br />
Prairie, and Bumping Lake. Crews continued firing operations to strengthen the north/south fireline (about one <br />
and a half miles northwest of Cliffdell) to keep active fire from moving west. Firefighters began installing dozer <br />
line from the most western point of Forest Road 1706 northwest toward American Ridge. Crews monitored and <br />
strengthened structure protection operations (hose lays, sprinklers, fuels clearing) in the Goose Prairie, Bumping <br />
Lake, Bumping River Road, and north/south portion of Highway 410 corridor areas. As expected, fire continued <br />
backing downslope on the western flank toward the Bumping River and on the northern flank at American Ridge <br />
toward Highway 410. Suppression repairs (e.g. road grading, naturalizing dozer lines that are no longer needed, <br />
installing water bars, hazard tree mitigation) were focused on areas important for winter recreation activities. <br />
Repair work continued with heavy equipment and personnel along the road systems north of Rimrock Lake, <br />
Bethel Ridge, and Nile Road.<br />
 <br />
Today: A dry, sunny day is forecast, with light winds coming from the south/southeast. Moderate fire behavior is <br />
expected near Edgar Rock, American Ridge, and Goose Prairie, with potential for isolated torching. Structure <br />
protection personnel, equipment, and air resources are ready to respond. Continued firing operations on the new <br />
fire line northwest of Cliffdell will depend on weather conditions. Creeping fire activity will be monitored on the <br />
eastern flank in the Wilderness.</span>

The Summit Trail Fire Information phone number, email address, and InciWeb page will no longer be active after <br />
8 p.m. tonight. Any future fire information will be posted on the Mt. Tolman Fire Center Facebook page at <br />
https://www.facebook.com/Mt-Tolman-Fire-Center-1049496928435678. <br />
<br />
At 7:00 a.m. on Wednesday, September 15, the Southwest Area Type 2 Incident Management Team 4 will <br />
transfer command of the Summit Trail Fire to a local Type 3 organization, led by Incident Commander Lonny <br />
Cawston. This is the final update from the Type 2 Incident Management Team. Team 4 extends its sincere thanks <br />
to the local communities for their support and hospitality throughout this incident. Due to successful firefighting <br />
efforts, the Summit Trail Fire is now 85% contained, and resources are either demobilizing to return to their home <br />
units or reassigning to assist other wildfires across the country. <br />
<br />
Operations: Firefighters are achieving success along the northern portion of the fire, increasing the depth of <br />
existing containment lines by 100 feet and extending containment on both sides. Crews will continue to pull <br />
pumps, tanks, and hoses from this area until all property is accounted for. On the northeastern flank of the fire, <br />
crews are searching on foot for any remaining heat along existing handlines. On the southern side of Hall Creek <br />
near Bear Springs, vegetation continues to smolder in a few isolated areas, although the northern section is now <br />
secured. Although some sections of fireline remain open, natural features such as wet drainages and marshes <br />
are acting as natural holding features to prevent fire spread. Interior portions of Brush Mountain continue to <br />
produce light smoke, but no flames have been detected. Crews are working across the fire area to backhaul <br />
excess equipment and return it to identified staging areas. The Suppression Repair Group is grading Hall Creek <br />
Road north of Inchelium as timber is hauled to the mills in the surrounding communities. Air resources remain <br />
available and ready to respond if the need arises.<br />
 <br />
Weather: Today will be mostly sunny and rain-free with seasonably mild temperatures. A weak cold front will <br />
move through on Wednesday, resulting in a few more clouds and breezy winds in the afternoon. Thursday will be <br />
the last rain-free and mild day of the week with light rain and cooler temperatures expected Friday through <br />
Sunday.<br />
 <br />
Safety: The health and safety of firefighters and the public is the first priority. The public is strongly encouraged to <br />
stay safely clear of the active fire area. Firefighters are conducting operations under protocols to mitigate the risk <br />
of COVID-19.  <br />
 <br />
Smoke: Smoke from surrounding fires may be visible in the area surrounding Inchelium. An interactive smoke <br />
map at https://wasmoke.blogspot.com/ allows you to zoom into your location to see the latest smoke information. <br />
Smoke-sensitive individuals and people with respiratory problems or heart disease are encouraged to take <br />
precautionary measures.</span>

<br />
Yesterday: Due to the high winds, a flare up occurred within the containment lines in the northeast section. <br />
Firefighting crews, engines, and a helicopter were able to respond quickly. The suppression efforts were effective <br />
and kept it within the containment lines.<br />
Road crews continued to work on road repairs to ensure safe access for fire personnel. Work on containment <br />
lines and mopping up continued. Firefighters patrolled and monitored the perimeters of the fire area.<br />
 <br />
Today: Firefighters will monitor and patrol containment lines. Mop up operations will continue in the burned <br />
areas. Chipping will be conducted along the 8410 Road. Backhaul of equipment and supplies from spike camps <br />
should be completed in the next few days. Firefighters will begin focusing on repair and rehab on areas damaged <br />
from suppression efforts.<br />
 <br />
Weather and Fire Behavior:  Wind is expected to be calmer today with stronger winds possible on the south <br />
slope of the ridges. Wet and colder weather is moving in this weekend with most of the precipitation occurring <br />
Friday night into Saturday morning.<br />
Conditions are expected to dappen fuels powering the fire and decrease the intensity of fire behavior. Fuels are <br />
starting to return to seasonal moisture levels and requiring more heat to start burning. This will help decrease the <br />
fire activity.<br />
 <br />
Evacuations: Effective at noon on September 13, all remaining evacuation notices related to the Twentyfive Mile <br />
Fire were removed. For more information, contact Chelan County Emergency Management, or follow their <br />
Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/CCSOEM.</span>

Yesterday, excavators continued to work on dozer line repairs in the Diamond Bell, Fox and Bunch road areas.  <br />
Hand crews worked around cabins and other structures to restore dozer berms to help the land recover. Crews <br />
continue to patrol the fire line and monitor the fire behavior at the northwest flank of Mt Bonaparte. <br />
<br />
Today, tree removal will continue along Bunch Road and residences in the area should use caution and expect <br />
delays.  The team is meeting with landowners in the area to address rehabilitation concerns. If any landowners <br />
have questions regarding rehabilitation standards on dozer lines or suppression efforts on their property, please <br />
contact Fire Information: 509-557-7257 (please leave a message).<br />
<br />
Attention Hunters: The Walker Creek Fire area (within the 204 GMU) remains closed to hunting.  Please respect <br />
closed road signs in the area.  Crews are continuing with suppression and repair efforts around the fire. Fire <br />
weakened trees and ash pits still exist throughout the landscape. Please help keep our firefighters working on <br />
the fire safe and avoid the area. <br />
<br />
Temperatures are cold this morning, in the upper 20’s at the crew spike camp near Havilla.  Winds will moderate <br />
today and temperatures will reach the mid 50’s. Rain chances will increase Friday and into Friday night with <br />
totals up to a half an inch over the weekend.<br />
<br />
Road closures and level 1 evacuations are still in effect for the fire area. Law enforcement officers continue to <br />
patrol the closed roads.</span>
