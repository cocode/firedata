<br />
John Day, OR – Firefighting operations on the Black Butte Fire are maintaining a steady pace. Yesterday and <br />
last night, fire crews monitored smoldering areas, keeping creeping flames under control. While cooler <br />
temperatures and higher humidity assisted the efforts, fuels are still extraordinarily receptive to fire and can <br />
readily ignite.<br />
<br />
Temperatures are anticipated to warm to the upper 70s today dropping into the upper 40s or and lower 50s at <br />
night. Winds will be at more typical levels from the northwest with afternoon gusts up to 15 mph. Fire behavior <br />
has moderated with the current cold weather pattern. In the afternoon, there could be some single tree <br />
torching in isolated pockets of fuel.<br />
<br />
Today, firefighters will work to keep the fire area controlled through mop up operations. This on-the-ground <br />
tactic is critical to successfully increase containment. Crews will be ensuring hotspots are put out at least 100 <br />
feet in from the perimeter. In addition, they will remain vigilant watching for any new fire starts as the weather <br />
returns to hotter and drier conditions.<br />
<br />
Closures:<br />
Recreation Sites within the closure boundary: North Fork Malheur River Trailheads both north and south, <br />
North Fork Malheur Campground, Crane Crossing Trailheads both east and west, Short Creek Guard Station, <br />
Elk Creek Campground, Sunshine Flat Trailhead and Trail, Horseshoe Trailhead and Trail, Sheep Creek Trail <br />
and Trailhead, Little Crane Campground.</span>

<br />
Announcement: Virtual community meeting scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Friday August 20, 2021 via Zoom.   <br />
<br />
Overview: Crews will utilize an Unmanned Aircraft System &#40;UAS&#41; or drone, to perform reconnaissance and <br />
gather information on the location of the fire and potential anchor points for burn operations. A spike camp will <br />
be setup for firefighters near the City of Detroit. A spike camp is a temporary camp that is set up closer to the <br />
fire to decrease travel time to and from the fire. This increases productivity and decreases risk of accidents as <br />
firefighters travel along mountain roads early in the morning or late in the evening. <br />
Yesterday’s Activities: Clear skies and decreased humidity resulted in moderate fire activity which provided <br />
firefighters a great opportunity to gain ground in preparing fire lines. Crews monitored for additional spot fires <br />
and continued mop up operations on the spot fire to the east. A Type 2 helicopter dropped water on the east <br />
side of the fire along Forest Road 6370 to help strengthen containment lines. Firefighters continued to <br />
construct indirect containment lines on the south, along Forest Road 4696 and prep for a low intensity burn <br />
operation along the road to reduce heavy fuels near the line.  <br />
Today’s Planned Activities: The primary objective is protecting the values to the south, Detroit and Breitinbush. <br />
Crews will continue to mop up the spot fire to the northeast while monitoring for any additional spot fires. <br />
Firefighters will continue to construct indirect containment lines to the southeast of the fire, along Forest Road <br />
6350, and Forest Road 6370 to the east. Masticators will be utilized to clear dense vegetation along the <br />
containment line. Mastication is a fuel reduction treatment used to reduce wildfire risk, by mulching vegetation <br />
into small chunks. <br />
Weather: Weather continues to be cooler with temps in the mid 70’s, with wind gusts up to 20 mph along the <br />
ridgetops. Smoke will continue to remain over the fire area and will be visible throughout the area. Affected <br />
communities should remain aware of smoke advisories and conditions. More information can be found at - <br />
www.airnow.gov or the Oregon Smoke Blog - https://oregonsmoke.blogspot.com/?m=1   <br />
Road Closures: Oregon Highway 224 is currently closed east of Promontory Park.    <br />
Area Closures:  Closure orders on National Forest System lands, roads, and trails within the Clackamas River <br />
Ranger District, Mt. Hood National Forest ORDER NO. 06-06-05-21-07. Forest closures are still in effect from <br />
the 2020 Beachie Creek and Lionshead Fires within the Willamette National Forest ORDER NO. 06-18-00-21-<br />
09.   <br />
Restrictions: Building, maintaining, attending, or using fire, campfire, or cooking fire, is prohibited throughout <br />
the Willamette National Forest ORDER NO. 06-18-00-21-16 and the Mt. Hood National Forest ORDER NO. <br />
06-06-00-21-04.</span>

<br />
Bulldog Mountain Fire:  Yesterday mild weather over the fire helped crews make good progress.  Firefighters <br />
continued working on the NE corner of the fire and were able to construct another indirect fire line to keep the <br />
fire away from private land and residents on the Hodgson-Lakin Rd.  Crews were also successful in scouting <br />
and constructing additional indirect line to the west of the fire.  Contingency line construction continued in the <br />
Davis Lake and Deadman Creek areas.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Today firefighters will strengthen indirect containment lines on northeast and west flanks of the fire.  <br />
Firefighters will patrol and perform direct fire attack on FS Road 6110 where appropriate.  Heavy equipment <br />
will be active again in Davis Lake and Deadman Creek.   Aircraft will be requested to assist if needed.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
The Bulldog Mountain Fire started August 5. 2021, located 20 miles north of Kettle Falls. The lightning caused <br />
fire spread quickly due to low relative humidity and unseasonably dry conditions.  The fire is burning in heavy <br />
timber and slash.  The fire is currently estimated at 5087 acres with 5% containment. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Mack Mountain Fire:  The Mack Mountain Fire started August 5, 2021 and is just south west of the Bulldog <br />
Mountain Fire.  The fire is estimated at approximately 1210 acres.  Residents in the Deadman Creek area will <br />
see increased firefighting traffic as crews move more heavy equipment into the area.  The fire area is located <br />
in steep, rugged terrain with limited access.  Firefighters will work west on Deadman Creek Road to <br />
strengthen the road as an indirect fire line.  Scouting work is underway to establish indirect fire line to the east <br />
of the fire.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Citizens should remain vigilant and are strongly encouraged to sign up for alerts at Ferry County Alerts.  <br />
Motorists traveling on the Boulder Hwy and SR395 should watch for heavy equipment and firefighters turning <br />
off and onto the roadway.  There are 200 personnel assigned to the incident. There have been two minor <br />
injuries with no structures lost.  Firefighter and public safety is our number one priority.  <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Level 1 evacuation orders and road closures are in place. For current evacuation orders please see Ferry <br />
County Sheriff’s Office Facebook page.  Boulder Creek Hwy and State Route 395 remain open.  For <br />
information on area & road closures on the Colville National Forest please see <br />
https://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fseprd938379.pdf   Citizens are asked to stay clear of <br />
the fire area and adhere to road and area closures. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />

<br />
With the lower wind speeds and improved overnight relative humidity, crews were able to make progress on <br />
both fires. Acreage on the Chickadee Fire was recently updated after inclement weather prevented infrared <br />
aircraft flights for multiple days. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Walker Creek Fire:  Firefighters were able to secure the 050 road to Bonaparte Lake Road, as well as tying <br />
into other existing roads, fortifying the northern edge of the fire. Activity by Squattersville kept firefighters and <br />
engines engaged yesterday. Crews were able to establish control line from Bonaparte Road to the 3230 <br />
Road. Aerial operations continued their bucket drops, making progress south of the 3230 road. Structure <br />
protection continues to be a top priority along with patrolling and scouting potential line improvements. On the <br />
north/northeast portion of the fire, crews will focus on prepping roads and putting in direct line. Cooling of <br />
hotspots around structures in that area is underway. Patrolling will also be done around Walker Lake and west <br />
of Summer Road. <br />
<br />
Chickadee Creek Fire:  Crews experienced spot fires east/northeast of control lines and concentrated on <br />
suppressing fire in that area. Firefighters continue to work down in the difficult Wickiup Creek area and <br />
southwest of the fire, securing lines. There was growth on Sarsapkin Road yesterday and hand crews, along <br />
with heavy equipment, prepped the roadway, attempting to box around that area and connect with Chickadee <br />
Creek Road.<br />
<br />
Evacuations: Evacuations remain in place. Refer to the Okanogan County, WA  county wide advisory map for <br />
updated changes.<br />

The Devil's Knob Complex is a group of lightning-caused fires with the majority burning on the Tiller Ranger <br />
District, of the Umpqua National Forest and on private lands protected by Douglas Forest Protective <br />
Association. The Devil’s Knob Complex is situated beneath the Rough Patch Complex and Jack Fire to the <br />
north, all of which are being managed by Great Basin Team 2.<br />
<br />
Evacuations and Closures: Visit the Douglas County Sheriff Office’s interactive evacuation map at<br />
www.dcso.com/evacuations Residents can opt in to receive emergency alerts by registering at <br />
www.dcso.com/alerts.<br />
<br />
The Umpqua National Forest has implemented an Emergency Fire Closure Order restricting public access to <br />
most of the Steamboat, North Umpqua, and South Umpqua drainages due to high fire danger and the safety <br />
of firefighting resources in the area. To view the Closure in its entirety, visit this link.<br />
General Updates: As firefighters continue with a full suppression strategy, they are maintaining a focus on <br />
protecting local values at risk for Douglas County. Incident Commander Tony DeMasters emphasized that <br />
coordination efforts between north and south County and working with agency partners and stakeholders is <br />
the key to success.<br />
<br />
“With 900 square miles of fire to manage, we really do appreciate the effort required to coordinate the <br />
operations and logistics required across the landscape,” said Forest officials on Wednesday. Other <br />
cooperators also noted, “We appreciate the work being done in cooperation with landowners in Seneca.”<br />
Smith Fire – 4037 acres –Firefighters continue to work on indirect and primary fireline. Construction of <br />
additional line continues with some burning operations to secure and protect lands west of the fire. The 100+ <br />
acre spot across the South Umpqua River to the east side has been challenging firefighters, although they are <br />
making some good progress.<br />
<br />
Mule Creek Fire – 1,023 acres – All containment lines held the fire in its current footprint; mop up operations<br />
continue.<br />
Big Hamlin Fire – 10,171 acres – Control lines on the west side of the fire are holding well. Firefighters are <br />
working on options for primary and alternate lines and expect to make additional progress on the west flank <br />
over the next several days. Fire crews are looking for additional lines on the south/southeast flank working off <br />
the primary road system and plan to conduct burnout operations on the south flank. A small spot was <br />
contained on the north side.<br />
Wild Cat - 215 acres – fire behavior was minimal, mop up operations continue.<br />
Little Applegate Fire – – 135 acres –contained and in patrol status. (This is the last report on this fire).<br />
Dismal Creek (444) Fire – 40 acres – contained and in patrol status; no smoke visible. (This swill be the last <br />
report on this fire).<br />
Section 30 (Railroad) Fire – 76 acres – Contained and in patrol status; no smokes.<br />
<br />
Weather: Wednesday’s weather was a bit warmer and drier with 70-80% humidity recovery overnight. Today <br />
will be a little warmer than Wednesday in the upper 70s to lower 80s with relative humidity in the mid 20-30 <br />
range and gusty winds to 25 mph, with possibility of some light drizzle overnight.<br />
<br />
Air Quality: Smoke levels can change rapidly depending on weather. Check current conditions on the Oregon <br />
Smoke Information Blog: http://oregonsmoke.blogspot.com/.<br />
<br />
Temporary Flight Restrictions: For the safety of the firefighters and aircraft fighting the Devil’s Knob Complex, <br />
a temporary flight restriction remains over portions of the fire area. Wildfires are a “No Drone Zone.”<br />
Conditions in the forest remain very dry. Any spark has a very high probability of starting a new fire, so the <br />
public is reminded to be extra careful while enjoying the out-of-doors. ”One Less Spark, One Less Wildfire.”</span>

Announcement:  A virtual public meeting for the Ford Corkscrew Fire will be held tonight, August 19, 2021, via <br />
Facebook at 7pm/PDT. To join, please visit the Northeast Washington Fire Information Facebook page at <br />
https://www.facebook.com/newfireinfo. <br />
<br />
Overview: Yesterday, the Southwest Area Incident Management Team 5 assumed command of the Ford <br />
Corkscrew Fire and immediately went to work to build on the success of the local initial attack team. Ground <br />
and aerial operations, including hand crews, engines, heavy equipment, helicopters, and airtankers continued <br />
to support firefighting operations, successfully increasing containment on the west side of the perimeter. <br />
Residents and visitors should continue to expect an increase in fire traffic around the Lakeside Middle School <br />
in Nine Mile Falls as more crews arrive to support the fire fighting efforts. <br />
<br />
Fire Update: The Ford Corkscrew Fire showed active fire behavior yesterday with torching, spotting, and <br />
uphill pushes throughout the fire area. Crews were successful in putting out several spot fires on the southern <br />
edge yesterday and will continue structural protection efforts as well as constructing direct and indirect line <br />
where safe to do so. <br />
<br />
Today, crews will continue the extensive including work being done across the fire area to protect surrounding <br />
communities including Williams Valley, infrastructure, and the perimeter as a whole. Residents are <br />
encouraged to contact Stevens County Emergency Management for more information on structure status <br />
assessments and follow updates on the Northeast Washington Fire Information Facebook page and Ford <br />
Corkscrew Fire Inciweb page (links below). Crews will continue monitoring fire behavior, conducting mop up <br />
operations, and patrolling/securing the fire perimeter today and throughout the night. <br />
<br />
Weather: Weather today will be hotter and drier than yesterday, which will support an increase in fire behavior. <br />
A return of southwest winds with lower relative humidity values and higher temperatures are expected today. <br />
These conditions are expected to be followed by two days of moderated fire weather prior to a stronger wind <br />
event and chance for showers or thunderstorms by the weekend. <br />
<br />
Closures/Restrictions: The following roads are closed: SR 231 between milepost 50, from the Ford-Wellpinit <br />
Road to Hidden Road, milepost 60 northwest of Spokane; Rail Canyon Road; McAlister Road and Scott’s <br />
Valley Road (at intersection with Burroughs). Additionally, a temporary flight restriction (TFR) is in effect <br />
around the fire area. Residents and visitors are also encouraged to maintain a safe distance from working air <br />
craft conducting water filling operations on local water ways and lakes, including Loon and Long lakes.<br />
<br />
Ways you can help: We greatly appreciate the support and generosity of the community! Our team’s focus is <br />
on the mission of fire suppression while keeping firefighter and public safety our number one priority. Our <br />
wildland fire crews and staff at Incident Command are well equipped and cared for. While we will not be <br />
accepting donations, residents are encouraged to support firefighter efforts and the local community in other <br />
ways such posting thank you or consider financial contributions to a voluntary organization of your choice <br />
(i.e., American Red Cross, local fire department, etc.).<br />
<br />
If you fly, we can’t: Flying recreational drones over or near wildfires could cause injury or death to firefighters <br />
and hamper the effectiveness of wildfire suppression operations. If recreational drones are detected over or <br />
near a wildfire, aerial firefighting aircraft may be grounded, causing wildfires to grow larger and unduly <br />
threaten lives, property, and natural and cultural resources. Individuals who interfere with wildfire suppression <br />
efforts may be subject to civil penalties.</span>

<br />
Lakeview, OR – Crews continue to make progress on the Fox Complex fires. This evening crews started a <br />
small burnout operation along the northern line of the Patton Meadow Fire beginning the process of “black <br />
lining” in the steep, rocky terrain. They will continue burnout operations along the northern perimeter as <br />
weather conditions allow.<br />
<br />
While a small spot fire was discovered and extinguished on the south end of the fire south of Highway 140, <br />
the southern edge continues to improve with mop-up operations hitting 50 feet into the fire’s interior. The spot <br />
fire had been smoldering beneath the surface for a few days and flared up due to increased wind in the area. <br />
Crews were able to catch the fire without difficulty.<br />
<br />
Crews on the west edge, along Patton Meadow Lane, have also reached a depth of 50 feet with mop-up <br />
activities. Crews on the eastern edge are working to extinguish hot spots and begin transitioning to mop-up.<br />
<br />
OSFM currently has 8 task forces assigned to the Patton Meadow Fire. OSFM crews patrolled the perimeter <br />
of the fire and structures to work on strengthening the fire line. Task forces assisted our local wildland <br />
partners with an initial attack of a fire that began between Lakeview and Bly along Highway 140. The task <br />
forces and crews were able to extinguish the fire quickly.<br />
<br />
With the successful efforts on the Willow Valley Fire, tonight will be the last night shift on the fire. Tomorrow <br />
will be the last day shift with the fire team handing the fire back to the local ODF Lake Unit Friday.<br />
<br />
ODF Team 3, OSFM Blue Team, and Lake County Sheriff's Office would like to invite you to a Fireside Chat <br />
with the Fox Complex Leadership. Please join us on Thursday, August 19, at 2:00 pm on the front lawn of the <br />
Lake County Fairgrounds. Details can be found here - https://fb.me/e/2CIkOohpD</span>

<br />
Containment Continues to Increase on the Green Ridge Fire<br />
<br />
Current Situation: Green Ridge Fire: On Wednesday, containment on the Green Ridge Fire increased to 29%. <br />
The fire is currently 38,787 acres. The additional containment line was added in Division M on Skyline Dr <br />
continuing up to the Panjab Campground, where it ties into previously contained line. The increased acreage <br />
was gained on the uncontained fire line on the southern perimeter the fire in Branch II. Fire activity was <br />
minimal yesterday, with no new growth in divisions K or M. Precipitation fell on the east side of the fire on <br />
Wednesday afternoon, helping minimize the fire’s growth.<br />
<br />
With lower relative humidity and higher temperatures than yesterday, a slight uptick in fire behavior is <br />
expected today. The fire is expected to slowly continue creeping and smoldering upslope in divisions W, S, <br />
and P, pushed by the upslope winds from the northwest. With severe fires burning across the west, firefighting <br />
resources are scarce. With the limited number of resources on the Green Ridge Fire, firefighters are focusing <br />
efforts on the area of highest priority and where there is a high probability of containment actions being <br />
successful. Currently, the highest priority area is the uncontained southeast perimeter of the fire. Crews will <br />
be in place in Branch II, improving the Hansen Ridge Road on Forest Service, state, and county lands to <br />
create a shaded fuel break as a contingency line. Crews will continue to hold and improve on the fire line in <br />
Branch I along the 22 (4022) Road, strengthening the fire line along the remaining uncontained perimeter and <br />
patrolling the contained fire line. <br />
<br />
Current Situation: Lick Creek Fire: The Lick Creek fire remains 80,421 acres and 97% contained.  Today’s <br />
northwest winds are expected to push the heat and smoke towards the interior of the fire. Interior fuels are <br />
expected to continue to smolder and burn minimally throughout the day. Firefighters assigned to Lick Creek <br />
fire will provide support to the Green Ridge fire when needed and continue to monitor and improve <br />
containment lines along the fire’s perimeter. <br />
<br />
Rocky Mountain Team Black will be hosting a community informational update on the Green Ridge and Lick <br />
Creek fires today at 7:00 p.m. at the Anatone Community Hall in Anatone, WA. Operations staff will give the <br />
community a brief update on the fire followed by an opportunity for the community to meet with incident <br />
managers and agency officials as well as ask questions about the fires. This event will not be livestreamed <br />
due to the informality of the event.<br />
<br />
Weather & Smoke Information: Weather is expected to be mostly sunny today, warming slightly from <br />
yesterday. Northwest winds are expected to be 4-8 mph, with gusts to 17 mph. Temperatures will be 64-70 <br />
degrees along the ridges and 77-83 degrees in the valley bottoms. Smoke information is available on <br />
Washington Smoke Blog at: https://wasmoke.blogspot.com/ <br />
<br />
Forest Closures: Closures are in place on the Umatilla National Forest. The forest closure for some areas on <br />
the Umatilla NF have been amended. The amended order reopened most Umatilla NF lands in Oregon. The <br />
order also closed all lands on the Walla Walla Ranger District in Washington; forest lands in Washington on <br />
the Pomeroy Ranger District remain closed to entry. The closure order is available at <br />
https://go.usa.gov/xFyhn.<br />
<br />
Evacuations: Garfield County currently has Level 1, 2 and 3 evacuations in place. Columbia County currently <br />
has Level 3, Level 2, and Level 1 evacuations in place. The Grouse Flats area is currently under a Level 1 <br />
evacuation in Garfield County, Asotin County, and Wallowa County, Oregon. An interactive fire map that <br />
shows evacuations and other important information is available at https://arcg.is/0mrCe1.</span>

Fire Update for Wednesday, August 18, 2021<br />
<br />
Overall Objective The Rough Patch Complex and Jack Fire are being managed under a full suppression <br />
strategy using containment and confinement tactics to minimize fire spread to prevent loss of valuable <br />
resource.  Leaders’ intent is to not allow the fire to progress to the west by using the PACE model – Primary, <br />
Alternate, Contingency and Emergency control Lines and to keep the fires as small as possible while working <br />
toward full containment.<br />
<br />
Closures The Umpqua and Willamette National Forests have updated existing closure orders to encompass <br />
the Rough Patch, Jack, Archie Creek and Devil's Knob Fire Areas. This includes Canton Creek Campground, <br />
Musick Guard Station and Cover Campground. <br />
<br />
Roseburg District Bureau of Land Management has expanded its closure area to include the Scaredman <br />
Recreation Site. Francis Creek Road from the junction with Canton Creek Road north to the district boundary <br />
has been and remains closed since August 5. <br />
<br />
Highway 138 between Roseburg and Diamond Lake and Crater Lake remains open.  Slow down and be alert <br />
while passing through the fire area.  <br />
<br />
Chaos and Little Bend Fires:  The primary containment lines of these fires lay on the west and northwest <br />
flanks.  Direct fire line construction and indirect fire lines with burnout operations are occurring in these areas <br />
of the fire. On the west and south flanks of these fire the primary containment lines are at the perimeter of the <br />
fire and heavy equipment is working to construct and reinforce alternate and contingency lines.  These two <br />
fires are at 0% containment, but progress is being made.<br />
<br />
Jack Fire:  The Jack Fire does have containment lines that are holding on the west and north flanks of the <br />
fires and these account for the 51% containment of the fire.  Fire crews are patrolling these flanks and taking <br />
action to hold the lines as necessary.  The southwest and south flanks of the fire is seeing active fire behavior  <br />
tactics on these flanks include direct dozer line, the construction of primary and alternate lines using the road <br />
system and building and reinforcing contingency lines along the 27 and 2715 roads.  The northeast part of the <br />
fire actively burn on Monday and increased the overall fire size by approximately 2,000 acres.<br />
<br />
Buckhead and Near Minky Fires:  These fires lay south of the Jack fire and have similar active fire behavior <br />
on the west flanks.  The contingency line being constructed with heavy equipment for the Jack fire will extend <br />
to the south and act as the primary holding line to prevent these fires from moving to the west.  On the south <br />
and east flanks of these fire, heavy equipment is working to build fire line to hold and prevent fire from <br />
escaping to the south and east.</span>

Containment Continues to Increase on the Green Ridge Fire<br />
<br />
Current Situation: Green Ridge Fire: On Wednesday, containment on the Green Ridge Fire increased to 29%. <br />
The fire is currently 38,787 acres. The additional containment line was added in Division M on Skyline Dr <br />
continuing up to the Panjab Campground, where it ties into previously contained line. The increased acreage <br />
was gained on the uncontained fire line on the southern perimeter the fire in Branch II. Fire activity was <br />
minimal yesterday, with no new growth in divisions K or M. Precipitation fell on the east side of the fire on <br />
Wednesday afternoon, helping minimize the fire’s growth.<br />
<br />
With lower relative humidity and higher temperatures than yesterday, a slight uptick in fire behavior is <br />
expected today. The fire is expected to slowly continue creeping and smoldering upslope in divisions W, S, <br />
and P, pushed by the upslope winds from the northwest. With severe fires burning across the west, firefighting <br />
resources are scarce. With the limited number of resources on the Green Ridge Fire, firefighters are focusing <br />
efforts on the area of highest priority and where there is a high probability of containment actions being <br />
successful. Currently, the highest priority area is the uncontained southeast perimeter of the fire. Crews will <br />
be in place in Branch II, improving the Hansen Ridge Road on Forest Service, state, and county lands to <br />
create a shaded fuel break as a contingency line. Crews will continue to hold and improve on the fire line in <br />
Branch I along the 22 (4022) Road, strengthening the fire line along the remaining uncontained perimeter and <br />
patrolling the contained fire line. <br />
<br />
Current Situation: Lick Creek Fire: The Lick Creek fire remains 80,421 acres and 97% contained.  Today’s <br />
northwest winds are expected to push the heat and smoke towards the interior of the fire. Interior fuels are <br />
expected to continue to smolder and burn minimally throughout the day. Firefighters assigned to Lick Creek <br />
fire will provide support to the Green Ridge fire when needed and continue to monitor and improve <br />
containment lines along the fire’s perimeter. <br />
<br />
Rocky Mountain Team Black will be hosting a community informational update on the Green Ridge and Lick <br />
Creek fires today at 7:00 p.m. at the Anatone Community Hall in Anatone, WA. Operations staff will give the <br />
community a brief update on the fire followed by an opportunity for the community to meet with incident <br />
managers and agency officials as well as ask questions about the fires. This event will not be livestreamed <br />
due to the informality of the event.<br />
<br />
Weather & Smoke Information: Weather is expected to be mostly sunny today, warming slightly from <br />
yesterday. Northwest winds are expected to be 4-8 mph, with gusts to 17 mph. Temperatures will be 64-70 <br />
degrees along the ridges and 77-83 degrees in the valley bottoms. Smoke information is available on <br />
Washington Smoke Blog at: https://wasmoke.blogspot.com/ <br />
<br />
Forest Closures: Closures are in place on the Umatilla National Forest. The forest closure for some areas on <br />
the Umatilla NF have been amended. The amended order reopened most Umatilla NF lands in Oregon. The <br />
order also closed all lands on the Walla Walla Ranger District in Washington; forest lands in Washington on <br />
the Pomeroy Ranger District remain closed to entry. The closure order is available at <br />
https://go.usa.gov/xFyhn.<br />
<br />
Evacuations: Garfield County currently has Level 1, 2 and 3 evacuations in place. Columbia County currently <br />
has Level 3, Level 2, and Level 1 evacuations in place. The Grouse Flats area is currently under a Level 1 <br />
evacuation in Garfield County, Asotin County, and Wallowa County, Oregon. An interactive fire map that <br />
shows evacuations and other important information is available at https://arcg.is/0mrCe1.</span>

Managed with the Bulldog Mountain Fire<br />
<br />
Bulldog Mountain Fire:  Yesterday low pressure moved into the region and assisted firefighters on the ground <br />
with wetting rain in the afternoon.  Crews conducted direct fire attack on the NE portion of the fire including <br />
some burnout operations to help tie in direct fire line to established containment lines. <br />
<br />
Forest Service Road 6110 continues to hold the fire from spreading to the east.  Heavy equipment crews <br />
continued contingency fire line construction into Deadman Creek.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Today firefighters will continue with small burnouts to help strengthen fire lines where the fire is approaching.  <br />
Heavy equipment will work east of the fire to strengthen established contingency lines.  Scouting continues to <br />
the west to determine places where additional indirect fire line construction may occur.  Aircraft will be <br />
requested to assist if needed.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
The Bulldog Mountain Fire started August 5. 2021, located 20 miles north of Kettle Falls. The lightning caused <br />
fire spread quickly due to low relative humidity and unseasonably dry conditions.  The fire is burning in heavy <br />
timber and slash.  The fire is currently estimated at 4625 acres with 5% containment. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Mack Mountain Fire:  The Mack Mountain Fire started August 5, 2021 and is just south west of the Bulldog <br />
Mountain Fire.  The fire is estimated at approximately 1200 acres.  Residents in the Deadman Creek area will <br />
see increased firefighting traffic as crews move more heavy equipment into the area.  The fire area is located <br />
in steep, rugged terrain with limited access.  Firefighters will work west on Deadman Creek Road to <br />
strengthen the road as an indirect fire line.  Scouting work is underway to establish indirect fire line to the east <br />
of the fire.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Citizens should remain vigilant and are strongly encouraged to sign up for alerts at Ferry County Alerts.  <br />
Motorists traveling on the Boulder Hwy and SR395 should watch for heavy equipment and firefighters turning <br />
off and onto the roadway.  There are 180 personnel assigned to the incident. There have been two minor <br />
injuries with no structures lost.  Firefighter and public safety is our number one priority.  <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Level 1 evacuation orders and road closures are in place. For current evacuation orders please see Ferry <br />
County Sheriff’s Office Facebook page.  Boulder Creek Hwy and State Route 395 remain open.  For <br />
information on area & road closures on the Colville National Forest please see <br />
https://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fseprd938379.pdf   Citizens are asked to stay clear of <br />
the fire area and adhere to road and area closures. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Northeast Washington IMT 2 assumed command of the fire August 7th.  Fire information and the incident <br />
command post is located at Kettle Falls High School in Kettle Falls, WA. Fire information contact is Jeff <br />

<br />
The limited resources available to the Middle Fork Complex are being utilized where they will be most <br />
effective in providing for life-safety and protection of communities; shifting to priority areas as needed. <br />
<br />
Kwis Fire: The remaining crews and equipment on Kwis continue to mop-up and complete alternate fire lines. <br />
Hazard trees that could fall and compromise fire lines by carrying fire into unburned areas are being removed. <br />
Crews are expecting similar fire behavior to what occurred yesterday with unburned islands of vegetation <br />
naturally consuming well within the fire perimeter and producing smoke, but with no increase to the size of the <br />
fire perimeter. Please continue to respect the closure area as there are still hazards in the area, as well as fire <br />
personnel and equipment. <br />
<br />
Gales and Ninemile Fires: The strategy for the Gales and Ninemile fires involves connecting roads and <br />
ridgetops to serve as containment line. For those containment lines to be effective, depth needs to be added.  <br />
This is accomplished by burning ground vegetation between the edge of the fire line and the advancing fire. <br />
Burnout operations to strengthen the fire line down into the Portland Creek drainage have progressed well <br />
and firefighters, supported with aviation assets, continue to work along the edge to ensure the fire stays within <br />
containment lines. North of the fire, crews and equipment are working along the 1832 road to improve it for <br />
use as a fire line.  North of Fall Creek, there is a small area where fire crossed the road on Tuesday and <br />
firefighters are working to tie that back into the 1832 road. While the initial priority for Gales and Ninemile <br />
Fires is to limit western and northward growth to protect communities and homes, firefighters are also working <br />
along road systems south and east of the fire while scouting for opportunities to connect roads via ridgetops <br />
or other natural features. <br />
<br />
Weather & Fire Behavior: Today’s humidity is expected to increase slightly from yesterday. Temperatures are <br />
expected to be similar to previous days. Winds will primarily be northwest with gusts reaching 15 miles per <br />
hour. The forecast shows a cool front arriving in the evening with the possibility of spotty showers. These <br />
showers are not expected to produce enough moisture to penetrate the canopy or affect fire activity.  <br />
<br />
When fire gets established in drainages, large diameter vegetation holds heat until the finer fuels dry in the <br />
afternoon and terrain driven winds push fire. Bubble Creek, Portland Creek and Tiller Creek are all holding <br />
quite a bit of heat and Delp and Saturn Creeks are expected to get wind alignment at some point. Aviation <br />
support will be dropping water as needed to slow fire spread in these drainages.  <br />
<br />
Evacuations: Level 1 and 3 evacuation notices have been issued by Lane County.  For current evacuation <br />
information and an interactive map of evacuation areas, visit: www.lanecounty.org.  <br />
<br />
Closures: Some National Forest System lands near the Middle Fork Complex are temporarily closed to <br />
provide for public safety. For more information, visit www.fs.usda.gov/willamette.</span>

<br />
Current Situation: Firefighters are using a combination of direct and indirect fire line from the northeast end of <br />
Conconully Lake toward NF-38 Road. Bulldozers have been working this area and will construct this line <br />
around Funk Mountain until terrain changes near the 38 Road. Crews are scouting the north portion of the fire <br />
from the 38 Road toward Muckamuck Mountain for terrain features favorable for line construction. A firing <br />
operation planned for the area west of Mineral Hill was discontinued yesterday due to unreceptive fuel <br />
conditions. The plan is to burn out the vegetation between the main body of the fire and the dozer lines <br />
constructed over the last several days. If conditions are favorable today that operation will resume. <br />
Firefighters are expected to complete structure work around Conconully today. No homes have been <br />
destroyed but the threat to the 387 homes in the area will remain until the established lines along the fire’s <br />
edge can be controlled around and above Conconully.  <br />
<br />
Weather: Today weather conditions will begin to change. This morning will be hazy and then partly cloudy in <br />
the afternoon. Temperatures will range from 75-85, winds will be from the northwest in the afternoon and <br />
there will be a slight increase in relative humidity. The forecast calls for a chance of showers beginning Friday <br />
morning with a slight chance of Thunderstorms.<br />

<br />
The Rough Patch Complex and Jack Fire are being managed under a full suppression strategy using <br />
containment and confinement tactics to minimize fire spread to prevent loss of valuable resource.  Leaders’ <br />
intent is to not allow the fire to progress to the west by using the PACE model – Primary, Alternate, <br />
Contingency and Emergency control Lines and to keep the fires as small as possible while working toward full <br />
containment. <br />
<br />
The Jack Fire does have containment lines that are holding on the west and north flanks of the fires and these <br />
account for the 51 percent containment of the fire.  Fire crews are patrolling these flanks and taking action to <br />
hold the lines as necessary.  The southwest and south flanks of the fire are seeing active fire behavior – <br />
tactics on these flanks include direct dozer line, the construction of primary and alternate lines using the road <br />
system and building and reinforcing contingency lines along the 27 and 2715 roads.</span>

<br />
Yesterday: Strong, gusty north and west winds led to extreme fire behavior. This resulted in several areas of <br />
spotting across control lines on the northeast side of the fire, west of Hwy 410. A Level 3 evacuation order <br />
was issued at 3:30 PM for areas along Hwy 410 from Rock Creek Road to Little Naches Road. When the <br />
evacuation orders were issued, fire crews went into structure protection mode, engaging pumps and sprinkler <br />
systems to protect structures. The fire was active on all fronts with most of the activity on the north and east <br />
sides. On Bumping River Road, the fire reached the River and a small fire spotted across the river, but crews <br />
held it between the river and the road.<br />
Today: Cooler weather and higher humidity will be beneficial for fire activity today and will provide fire <br />
managers a chance to assess the fire spread from yesterday. Crews are actively working along the Highway <br />
410 corridor and Bumping River Road, and in the interior where additional fire lines are being developed or <br />
strengthened. Air assets in the form of federally-operated drones will confirm fire spread, and aircraft will fly as <br />
resources are available and weather conditions permit. The southeast corner at Rattlesnake Springs drainage <br />
is currently holding well, as are containment measures along Bumping River Road and the Goose Prairie <br />
community. Evaluation for pump systems and sprinkler systems will continue, and adjustments will be made <br />
where necessary. Resources are continuing to arrive by the hour. A Red Cross shelter has been established <br />
at Summit View Church of Christ, 100 North 72nd Avenue in Yakima.<br />
Evacuations: A LEVEL 3 evacuation order has been issued from Rock Creek Road to Little Naches Road <br />
along Hwy 410.  Bumping River Road and drainage remains at a LEVEL 3 evacuation.  This means if you live <br />
in either of these two LEVEL 3 areas, you need to GO NOW and evacuate.  Additionally, Hwy 410 from Eagle <br />
Rock north to Rock Creek Rd and from Little Naches Road west to Bumping River Road is currently in a <br />
LEVEL 2. Those living in these LEVEL 2 areas need to BE SET and prepared for potential evacuation. Check <br />
with Yakima County Office of Emergency Management for updates on evacuation information. Residents and <br />
visitors are encouraged to sign up for emergency alerts through Yakima County: yakimacounty.us/2222/Alert-<br />

TAll Evacuations Lifted on Skyline Ridge Complex<br />
<br />
CANYONVILLE, Ore. – Due to reduced fire activity, the Douglas County Sheriff's Office has lifted the Level 1 <br />
(Be Ready) evacuation notice for Ferguson Lane and Moore Ranch Road, north of the Poole Creek Fire. <br />
There are no evacuations associated with the Skyline Ridge Complex at this time, but evacuations on the <br />
Devil's Knob Complex are still in effect. Check the Douglas County website at <br />
https://www.dcso.com/EVACUATIONS for more information.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Firefighters have made significant progress on the Skyline Ridge Complex. All of the smaller fires are fully <br />
contained and containment for the Complex has risen to 93%. The number of personnel on the fire is <br />
dropping rapidly as crews are reassigned to other fires or sent home to rest.<br />
<br />
The northern part of the Poole Creek Fire and some areas near Stouts Creek did not burn clean. Known as <br />
“dirty burns”, these areas have enough vegetation remaining after a fire passes through them to continue to <br />
have small flare-ups. Slow, methodical work is needed to locate residual heat and cool it. While steep slopes <br />
and hazardous snags complicate the work, crews detect less heat in these areas each day.<br />
<br />
Gusty winds are expected this afternoon and evening, increasing the danger of falling snags and other hazard <br />
trees. Firefighters will stay out of snag patches during the windy spells. The interior of the fire has some <br />
unburned pockets of vegetation which may burn in the coming days. Firefighters will continue to monitor for <br />
interior flare-ups and will take action if necessary.<br />
<br />
The public is asked to please avoid driving the roads being used by firefighters. Many of the roads have <br />
limited room for passing vehicles.<br />
<br />
On Friday, Oregon Department of Forestry Incident Management Team 1 (ODF IMT1) will return the <br />
management of the Skyline Ridge Complex to local fire managers. At that time, the Incident Command Post <br />
(ICP) near Myrtle Creek will close. This is the last daily update from ODF IMT1. The Team would like to thank <br />
the local community and partners for their support during this incident.</span>

ISummit Trail Fire<br />
August 19, 2021<br />
Fire Information: 385-999-1380<br />
E-mail: 2021.summittrail@firenet.gov<br />
Inchelium, WA – The Summit Trail Fire was started by lightning on July 12, and is burning on the Colville <br />
Reservation approximately 17 miles west of Inchelium in terrain that is steep, rough and often difficult to <br />
access.  Favorable weather conditions and firefighters’ intensive work have made it possible to maximize <br />
resources for good progress on the fire’s containment. Officials at the Colville Tribes have reduced evacuation <br />
levels across the areas affected by the Summit Trail Fire. <br />
Yesterday, cooler temperatures and increased humidity continued to moderate fire behavior, making it safer <br />
for crews to make additional progress on both direct (situated directly on the fire’s edge) and indirect <br />
(positioned beyond the fire’s edge) containment. Without the smoke or rain to impair visibility, aircraft could <br />
support firefighters’ efforts with water bucket drops as well as aerial reconnaissance. Crews assisted Mount <br />
Tolman Fire Center personnel with containing a new fire start near Simpson Lake. Overnight, firefighters on <br />
patrol found and contained another new fire start west of Cuba Canyon. These could possibly be spot fires <br />
that have been smoldering since Sunday’s Red Flag conditions or the result of lightning strikes on Monday. <br />
The total size of the two new fires is 5-6 acres; both were quickly contained. <br />
Today, crews will continue to leverage the current weather pattern to construct and connect containment lines <br />
as close to the fire’s perimeter as possible on the north and east flanks.  On the south and west flanks, <br />
firefighters will engage in on-going efforts to mop-up and patrol the established lines as well as work on <br />
bringing a line from the fire’s northwest corner to tie in with the northern flank.    <br />
Summit Trail Evacuations: Evacuation levels are subject to change. For more information about evacuations, <br />

Level 1 (Green – “Get Ready”): Residences along the Inchelium Highway from Inchelium to the boundary of <br />
the Colville Reservation. East of Seyler Valley Road to Gwen Mine Road and Cobb Creek Road. Twin Lakes <br />
area and structures along Bridge Creek Road.  <br />
Evacuation Shelter: Located at the Inchelium Longhouse and Community Center – 9 Community Loop, <br />
Inchelium, Washington 509-936-2919. These facilities have been designated for those affected by the Summit <br />
Trail Fire.<br />

<br />
The Twentyfive Mile Fire was first reported at 3:45 p.m. on August 15, 2021. The fire was initially burning on <br />
the south shore of Lake Chelan near Twentyfive Mile Creek and has expanded south and west of the area. <br />
The fire is under joint jurisdiction of the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest, Washington Department of <br />
Natural Resources, Bureau of Land Management and Chelan County Fire District 7.<br />
<br />
A Type 3 Incident Management Team led by Incident Commander Escobar took command of the firefighting <br />
response at 6:00 a.m. August 16. Additional resources are continuing to arrive. The Southwest Type 1 (IC <br />
Sinclair) Incident Management Team have begun to arrive on scene and are expected to be briefed later this <br />
afternoon.<br />
  <br />
The fire continues to burn in timber, brush and grass. The fire size is estimated at 9,800 acres. Crews staffed <br />
the fire overnight and continued to reinforce structure protection lines. Overnight, crews were challenged by <br />
fire moving towards Lakeshore Road near the Twentyfive Mile drainage. Crews were able to engage the fire <br />
and prevent further movement toward the road and structures.<br />
<br />
Moderate fire behavior is expected today as crews continue to work. Higher winds with strong gusts have the <br />
potential to increase fire activity. Today crews will work on constructing and reinforcing new containment lines. <br />
The fire may continue to move to the south and east.<br />
<br />
Rotor and fixed-wing air resources will continue attack on the fire throughout the day. Aircraft may use local <br />
bodies of water, including Lake Chelan, to fill. Recreational boaters should be aware of aircraft takeoff and <br />
landings and keep a safe distance.<br />
<br />
Evacuations: The most up-to-date evacuation information is available through Chelan County Emergency <br />
Management at the following links. Current evacuation levels remained in place overnight and will continue <br />
throughout the day. The Chelan County Sherriff will update evacuation levels as conditions warrant.<br />
<br />
Level 3 (Go Now) evacuations for all properties north of Cove Marina on South Lakeshore Road, the area of <br />
Granite Falls Road and First Creek Road west of Lakeshore. Lakeshore Road is closed from Cove Marina <br />
north past the Twentyfive Mile drainage.<br />
 <br />
Level 2 (Get Set) from South from Cove Marina to Morning Sun Drive.<br />
 <br />
Level 1 (Get Ready) Lakeshore Road south of Granite Falls area.</span>

<br />
With the lower wind speeds and improved overnight relative humidity, crews were able to make progress on <br />
both fires. Acreage on the Chickadee Fire was recently updated after inclement weather prevented infrared <br />
aircraft flights for multiple days. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Walker Creek Fire:  Firefighters were able to secure the 050 road to Bonaparte Lake Road, as well as tying <br />
into other existing roads, fortifying the northern edge of the fire. Activity by Squattersville kept firefighters and <br />
engines engaged yesterday. Crews were able to establish control line from Bonaparte Road to the 3230 <br />
Road. Aerial operations continued their bucket drops, making progress south of the 3230 road. Structure <br />
protection continues to be a top priority along with patrolling and scouting potential line improvements. On the <br />
north/northeast portion of the fire, crews will focus on prepping roads and putting in direct line. Cooling of <br />
hotspots around structures in that area is underway. Patrolling will also be done around Walker Lake and west <br />
of Summer Road. <br />
<br />
Chickadee Creek Fire:  Crews experienced spot fires east/northeast of control lines and concentrated on <br />
suppressing fire in that area. Firefighters continue to work down in the difficult Wickiup Creek area and <br />
southwest of the fire, securing lines. There was growth on Sarsapkin Road yesterday and hand crews, along <br />
with heavy equipment, prepped the roadway, attempting to box around that area and connect with Chickadee <br />
Creek Road.<br />
<br />
Evacuations: Evacuations remain in place. Refer to the Okanogan County, WA  county wide advisory map for <br />
