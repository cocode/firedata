<br />
Fire activity picked up yesterday afternoon as temperatures warmed under the afternoon sun.  The Bull <br />
Complex grew approximately 350 acres; it continues to grow steadily around the fire perimeter.  Firefighters <br />
have successfully achieved some containment on the northern edge, where Elk Lake Creek meets the <br />
Collawash River.  They will continue taking fireline directly along the fire’s edge to both the west and the east, <br />
utilizing natural terrain features (such as ridges or meadows) to assist them in building containment lines. <br />
<br />
Firefighters are putting their main focus on the southern edge of the fire, where the fire is closest to <br />
communities.  Managers are in close coordination with Marion Country officials to ensure consistent and <br />
proactive communications should conditions change and create the need to facilitate evacuations.  At this <br />
time, firefighters are successfully holding the fire north of Forest Road 4696. <br />
<br />
All assigned helicopters are moving to the Davis Airstrip in Gates.  This consolidation will improve logistical <br />
support to the helicopters and their crews.  They will continue to support ground firefighters through water <br />
drops and supply deliveries as needed.  Please use caution if traveling near the Airstrip, as heavy equipment <br />
traffic will increase as a result of this move. <br />
<br />
Today and tomorrow will be warmer and drier as a high pressure ridge moves over the area.  Wind direction <br />
will switch to a north/northeast wind but are expected to remain light.  Increased fire activity is likely, and <br />
smoke is expected to be more visible than in previous days.  However, thanks to recent light rains and higher <br />
humidity, the overall conditions are not expected to produce extreme fire behavior.  Another cold front arrives <br />
on Monday, bringing a change back to westerly winds with lower temperatures and higher relative humidity. <br />
<br />
Closures:  For the safety of wildland firefighters and the public, the National Forests have enacted area <br />
closures that prevent the public from being upon National Forest System lands in the vicinity of the Bull <br />
Complex where uncontrolled fire and fire suppression activities are occurring. All Forest lands that are south <br />
and west of Forest Road 46, and east of the Riverside Fire perimeter are closed. The entire length of Forest <br />
Road 46 is closed. The lands within the 2020 Lionshead and Beachie Creek Fire areas are also closed.  See <br />
the closure orders and maps at https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/closures/7773/. <br />
<br />
Contractors approved by the Forest Service through a permit system are allowed through the closure order, <br />
as are vendors and others working on recovery efforts related to the 2020 area fires.  Breitenbush Hot <br />
Springs Resort is open; however, reservations are required to pass through a roadblock on Forest Road 46. <br />

Kettle Falls, WA – Yesterday on the Bulldog Mountain fire, chipping of fuels along the northeast edge <br />
continued. Firefighters patrolled and took actions to hold the remainder of the fire within containment lines. <br />
<br />
Work will continue today to chip woody material and remove dangerous snags along the South Boulder Road <br />
as well as along the Davis Lake area. This work will prepare these roads as fire lines in the event that the fire <br />
moves out of its current footprint.  <br />
<br />
On the Mack Mountain fire, crews completed chipping operations along the 800 Road ahead of the eastern <br />
flank. Firefighters will continue to monitor and reinforce fire lines around the fire. Air resources will monitor <br />
both fires for active fire behavior. <br />
<br />
Yesterday the slightly cooler and windier weather provided more moisture over the fire areas as expected. In <br />
the weather forecast for the next few days, there will be a wind shift from northwest to southwest. With a new <br />
wind pattern and expected warmer temperatures, unburned fuels in the understory will show potential for <br />
increased fire behavior.    <br />
<br />
Citizens should remain vigilant and are strongly encouraged to sign up for alerts at  Ferry County Alerts.  <br />
Motorists traveling on Boulder Hwy and SR395 should watch for heavy equipment and firefighters turning off <br />
and onto the roadway. Firefighter and public safety is our number one priority.  <br />
<br />
Smoke: Current weather conditions will moderate smoke impacts throughout the area today.  <br />
<br />
Closures: An area closure is in effect on Colville National Forest lands in the vicinity of the Bulldog Mountain <br />
Fire. For more information on area and road closures on the Colville National Forest, please visit: <br />
https://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fseprd938379.pdf <br />
<br />
Citizens are asked to stay clear of the fire area and comply with area closures.  <br />
<br />
While current weather conditions provide respite from the extreme fire potential present in northeast <br />
Washington, the forest can quickly dry out again in the many weeks of fire season ahead. Please continue to <br />
do all you can to prevent wildfires. The Colville National Forest remains at IFPL level 3. Road closures remain <br />
in effect.  <br />
<br />
<br />
The Colville National Forest has gone from IFPL level 4 to IFPL level 3 as of today. Road closures remain in <br />
effect.  <br />
<br />
The Incident Command Post is located in Inchelium, WA. A spike camp will remain in place in Kettle Falls, WA <br />
to support the Bulldog Mountain and Mack Mountain Fires.</span>

Winthrop, WA – The Cedar Creek, Cub Creek 2, and Delancy fires are burning on the Okanogan-Wenatchee <br />
National Forest and public and private lands within Okanogan County.<br />
<br />
Fire Information Line: (509) 557-0740 (8:00 am to 8:00 pm daily)<br />
<br />
Cedar Creek Fire: The fire is 55,187 acres and 80% contained. On Friday, several small pockets of smoke <br />
were observed in the drainages along the north side of the fire, but there was no threat to any of the <br />
containment lines. Drainages and ridges will continue to be monitored by air. As mop up continues in the <br />
burned area, crews will be focused on removing any heat near structures utilizing an infrared camera to aid in <br />
this work. Hand lines that were put in to contain the fire near Early Winters Creek are being repaired, and <br />
excavators will work to repair dozer lines along other sections of the fire.<br />
<br />
Cub Creek 2 Fire: The Cub Creek 2 Fire is 70,186 acres and 70% contained. Smoke seen on the southern <br />
edge of the fire was quickly mopped up by engines. Falling crews are working to remove hazard trees in the <br />
Nice Campground. In the area around the Brevicomis summer homes, an infrared camera will help fire <br />
personnel to find and remove any remaining heat. Mop up will also continue in the riparian corridor around <br />
Bud Creek, where crews are systematically searching for and cooling pockets of heat. Resource advisors are <br />
flagging areas for suppression repair. Excavators will repair dozer lines along the western edge of the fire.<br />
<br />
Delancy Fire: The Delancy Fire is being monitored by aerial surveillance and remains at 223 acres and 95% <br />
containment. <br />
<br />
Fire Weather: A warm-up is expected for the weekend as high pressure settles over the region. Temperatures <br />
will return to normal with highs in the lower 80s. It will also be much drier with humidity minimums between 20 <br />
and 30 percent. Winds are expected to be light and terrain-driven, with speeds under 15 mph.</span>

The Chickadee Creek Fire is located approximately 15 miles west of Tonasket, Washington. The Walker <br />
Creek Fire is located approximately 13 miles east/northeast of Tonasket, Washington, surrounding Lake <br />
Bonaparte. The Incident Command Post at the Omak Stampede Grounds is closed to all but essential <br />
personnel to help ensure the health and safety of community members and firefighters. There will be a <br />
warming and drying trend over the weekend, with temperatures today ranging from 70 to 80 degrees.<br />
 <br />
Operations - Fire crews and equipment are being shifted around both fires internally as assignments are <br />
completed to allow the most efficient use of resources:<br />
 <br />
Chickadee Creek Fire<br />
Fire crews are continuing mop-up on the western fire perimeter. Firefighters completed additional dozer line <br />
on the northern fire edge yesterday and prepared areas for burnout operations to secure containment lines. <br />
Fire crews built direct dozer line up against the fire’s edge on the southern portion of the fire, working to keep <br />
the fire in the smallest possible footprint. Helicopter water bucket drops cooled hot spots on the eastern edge <br />
of the fire. A burnout operation is planned today above the road on the eastern fire edge, to remove pockets of <br />
unburned fuels and secure the fire line.<br />
 <br />
Walker Creek Fire<br />
Firefighters completed a section of indirect line along the northwestern fire perimeter. Fire crews are mopping <br />
up the northeastern fire edge and are building direct fire line along the eastern fire perimeter to minimize the <br />
fire size. Firefighters continued mop-up work along the southern fire perimeter and patrolled to locate and <br />
extinguish remaining heat sources near the fire line yesterday. Today, fire crews will continue to mop-up and <br />
patrol across the fire and will construct direct fire line in areas where it is feasible.<br />
 <br />
Evacuations<br />
Evacuation levels decreased on both fires today. For details, see the Okanogan County Emergency <br />

containment lines. Drainages and ridges will continue to be monitored by air. As mop up continues in the <br />
burned area, crews will be focused on removing any heat near structures utilizing an infrared camera to aid in <br />
this work. Hand lines that were put in to contain the fire near Early Winters Creek are being repaired, and <br />
excavators will work to repair dozer lines along other sections of the fire.<br />
<br />
Cub Creek 2 Fire: The Cub Creek 2 Fire is 70,186 acres and 70% contained. Smoke seen on the southern <br />
edge of the fire was quickly mopped up by engines. Falling crews are working to remove hazard trees in the <br />
Nice Campground. In the area around the Brevicomis summer homes, an infrared camera will help fire <br />
personnel to find and remove any remaining heat. Mop up will also continue in the riparian corridor around <br />
Bud Creek, where crews are systematically searching for and cooling pockets of heat. Resource advisors are <br />
flagging areas for suppression repair. Excavators will repair dozer lines along the western edge of the fire.<br />
<br />
Delancy Fire: The Delancy Fire is being monitored by aerial surveillance and remains at 223 acres and 95% <br />
containment. <br />
<br />
Fire Weather: A warm-up is expected for the weekend as high pressure settles over the region. Temperatures <br />
will return to normal with highs in the lower 80s. It will also be much drier with humidity minimums between 20 <br />
and 30 percent. Winds are expected to be light and terrain-driven, with speeds under 15 mph.</span>

The Devil's Knob Complex is a group of lightning-caused fires on the Tiller Ranger District of the Umpqua <br />
National Forest and private lands protected by Douglas Forest Protective Association and the Cow Creek <br />
Band of the Umpqua Tribe of Indians.  <br />
<br />
Smith Fire (16,158 acres): Firefighters continue working to expand control lines on all sides with air resources <br />
providing support where feasible and as weather allows. In Ash Valley, two engine task forces from Douglas <br />
and Linn counties through the Office of Oregon State Fire Marshall and resources from Douglas Forest <br />
Protective Association have timed out. However, a system of hose lays and sprinklers remains in place for <br />
structure protection. Along the fire’s northwest side, firefighters are improving holding lines and planning for <br />
strategic firing operations to further extend fireline.  <br />
<br />
Big Hamlin Fire (13,587 acres): Firefighters are working to build and scout firelines as the fire shows relatively <br />
slow growth overall. Containment lines along the western perimeter are holding well. Crews continue strategic <br />
firing operations along the southeastern edge from Fawn Creek toward Whiskey Creek as conditions allow. <br />
The Douglas County Sheriff’s Office has lifted the Level 3 evacuation advisory previously put in place for <br />
homes on Beaver Creek Road. <br />
<br />
Dismal Creek, Little Applegate, Mule Creek, Section 30 (Railroad) and Wild Cat fires (1,489 total acres): <br />
These fires are containedand remain in patrol status. <br />
<br />
Weather: Temperatures are anticipated to rise into the upper 80s, with hot and dry conditions contributing to <br />
the potential for increased fire activity. However, fire behavior might be moderated depending on amount of <br />
smoke cover. Winds shifted to a light northeasterly flow yesterday but have not significantly impacted fire <br />
activity and are expected to shift back to a northwesterly flow today. <br />
<br />
Air Quality: Check latest conditions on the Oregon Smoke Information Blog: <br />
http://oregonsmoke.blogspot.com. <br />
<br />
Aviation Operations: The Incident Management Team has established a helibase near Days Creek to better <br />
support firefighting efforts. For the safety of firefighters and aircraft fighting the Devil’s Knob Complex, a <br />
temporary flight restriction remains in place over the firearea. Wildfires are also a “No Drone Zone.” <br />

<br />
Announcement:  There will continue to be unburned pockets of trees putting up smoke for the foreseeable <br />
future. Until there is wetting rain, or the snow flies, warm, sunny days will cause unburned islands of trees to <br />
flame up and put up smoke. Please do not report these smoke plumes unless they are close to the fire line. <br />
<br />
Overview: The Ford Corkscrew Fire showed Minimal fire behavior yesterday due to overnight light <br />
precipitation, increased cloud cover, and higher RH values. Interior creeping, backing, and flanking fire <br />
behavior will continue and will likely cause visible smoke columns.  <br />
<br />
Fire Update: During yesterday’s operational period for the Ford Corkscrew Fire, resources continued mop up <br />
activities, patrolled containment lines, and identified suppression repair needs. Crews continue to utilize <br />
infrared monitors to identify and secure unburned islands around structures in Rail Canyon.  <br />
<br />
Evacuations are still in place for the Ford Corkscrew Fire. Please refer to the map on Inciweb at <br />
https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/7803/ or Stevens County Sheriff’s Office Facebook page. If you have <br />
questions, please call the fire information phone lines above. Please note, the reduction in acres is due to <br />
better data on containment line locations. As containment line and fire edge confirmations are received from <br />
field personnel, further adjustments in acreage are expected. <br />
<br />
For structure status information, please email your name, contact information, and address of the property <br />
you are inquiring about to 2021.fordcorkscrew@firenet.gov or call 509-508-3311 between the hours of 8am <br />
and 8pm PDT. An agency representative from the Stevens County Fire District 1 will contact you as soon as <br />
possible. <br />
<br />
Weather: For the weekend ahead, a weak ridge of high pressure returns with warming and drying conditions <br />
returning, but with lighter winds to keep conditions moderated. Temperatures will warm back to around <br />
seasonal norms or slightly warmer, as relative humidity values drop back into the lower 20 percent range. <br />
Winds will favor a southwesterly direction and remain below breezy levels. Mid week, next week, a few low <br />
pressure systems arrive that look to lower temperatures, with more clouds, and slight rises in moisture to <br />
increase relative humidity. Winds may also become a bit breezy, but no extreme conditions are expected. <br />
<br />
Closures/Restrictions: Some roads within the and near the fire perimeter remain closed and a temporary flight <br />
restriction (TFR) remains in effect around the fire area. Residents and visitors are also encouraged to <br />
maintain a safe distance from working aircraft conducting water filling operations on local water ways and <br />
lakes, including Loon and Long lakes.  <br />
<br />
Ways you can help: We greatly appreciate the support and generosity of the community! Our team’s focus is <br />
on the mission of fire suppression while keeping firefighter and public safety our number one priority. Our <br />
wildland fire crews and staff at Incident Command are well equipped and cared for. While we will not be <br />
accepting donations, residents are encouraged to support firefighter efforts and the local community in other <br />
ways such posting thank you or consider financial contributions to a voluntary organization of your choice <br />
(i.e., American Red Cross, local fire department, etc.). <br />
<br />
If you fly, we can’t: Flying recreational drones over or near wildfires could cause injury or death to firefighters <br />
and hamper the effectiveness of wildfire suppression operations. If recreational drones are detected over or <br />
near a wildfire, aerial firefighting aircraft may be grounded, causing wildfires to grow larger and unduly <br />
threaten lives, property, and natural and cultural resources. Individuals who interfere with wildfire suppression <br />
efforts may be subject to civil penalties.</span>

<br />
Lakeview, OR- This is the final update from the Fox Complex.<br />
<br />
The Patton Meadow Fire of the Fox Complex remained at 8,930 acres yesterday with containment growing to <br />
90%.<br />
<br />
Tomorrow a local Type 4 team assumes management of the fire at 8:00am. Today they will shadow ODF <br />
Team 3 as they prepare to take over. When they assume management, they will complete any remaining mop <br />
up, patrol the perimeter of the fire, bring back any remaining, unnecessary equipment, and continue <br />
suppression repair work.<br />
<br />
Crews will continue mop up operations on the north side of the fire, going 200-300 feet deep, extinguishing <br />
any hot spots they discover. In the morning briefing, Operations Section Chief Rob Pentzer told crews, “Do <br />
one more grid, one more look for hot spots so we can have this wrapped up.” By the end of the shift, the <br />
entire fire perimeter will have a rind at least 200 feet deep into the interior.<br />
<br />
Efforts on the east, south and west sides of the fire will continue with hauling equipment back to fire camp and <br />
repairing dozer and hand lines that were part of the firefighting effort. As the firefighting effort winds down, <br />
most crews will be demobilizing and heading home or onto other fire assignments. There will be some crews <br />
and equipment remaining to help the Type 4 team manage the fire going forward.<br />
<br />
As the work continues, and the season continues, the public may see smoke from the interior of the fire. This <br />
is normal and does not pose any threat to the public.<br />
<br />
The Fremont-Winema Forest, and fire area, remains closed due to fire danger. For the latest information on <br />
the forest closures, go to https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/fremont-winema/alerts-notices/?cid=stelprdb5317501.</span>

<br />
Current Situation: Green Ridge Fire: Activity on the Green Ridge Fire was minimal due to periods of rain <br />
Thursday night, high relative humidity, and cooler temperatures.  A Wilfire Use Module and Umatilla National <br />
Forest Type-2 IA crews made good progress yesterday and will keep building direct control line along the <br />
southeast corner of the fire from the Jeffery Spring area heading south to Diamond Creek Road in the area <br />
around Mount Misery.  Winds may be gusty on sections of the fire that today that could test secured line. <br />
Crews continued to patrol and mop up other sections of uncontrolled line along portions of the northeast <br />
corner, near Clear Water lookout tower and guard station, and southwest corner near Godman Trailhead <br />
along Skyline Drive. <br />
<br />
Current Situation: Lick Creek Fire: The Lick Creek Fire remains 80,421 acres and is now 100% contained. <br />
Smoke will continue to be visible as unburned pockets of vegetation inside the fire perimeter are consumed. <br />
Crews will continue to mop-up any interior pockets of heat and patrol lines as they can safely.  <br />
<br />
Weather & Smoke Information: Today’s weather will be mostly sunny with haze. Temperatures will have highs <br />
between 66-71 degrees along the ridges and 75-80 degrees in the valley bottoms. Winds will shift east-<br />
northeast to 5 – 8 mph with gusts up to 15 mph in the afternoon. Relative humidity will range from 30-35% <br />
above 5000 feet and 25-30% in the valleys. Smoke information is available on Washington Smoke Blog at: <br />
https://wasmoke.blogspot.com/  <br />
<br />
Forest Closures: A reduced Fire Emergency Closure is in place on the Umatilla National Forest and has been <br />
updated as of today (August 28, 2021). The closure order map can be found at <br />

<br />
Northern Rockies Incident Management Team 1 took command of the Rough Patch Complex and Jack Fire at <br />
6:00 a.m. this morning. There is a new number for Fire Information: 541-482-1331. <br />
<br />
Summary:  The Rough Patch Complex and Jack Fire are being managed under a full suppression strategy <br />
using direct and indirect tactics to minimize fire spread to prevent loss of valuable resources. Leaders’ intent <br />
is to minimize any fire progression to the west and to protect private structures throughout the fire area. The <br />
Rough Patch consists of four fires: Chaos, Little Bend, Buckhead and Near Minky.  <br />
<br />
Chaos and Little Bend Fires:  The Chaos fire is at 15,301 acres and the Little Bend fire is at 6,573 acres. <br />
Fireline on the west side of the Chaos fire continues to hold. Crews are making progress on the northwest <br />
side of the fire constructing line from Shane Saddle to Bohemia Mountain. Structure protection needs are <br />
being evaluated north of the Chaos. Along the southern boundary of Chaos, line construction along the 3821 <br />
road continues toward the southern end of Little Bend. Crews are continuing to improve containment lines by <br />
conducting mop-up operations from previous days burnout. When conditions are favorable, firing operations <br />
will continue along this southern boundary toward the Little Bend.  <br />
<br />
Jack and Buckhead Fires:  The Jack fire is at 23,866 acres and the Buckhead fire is at 3,226 acres. The Jack <br />
fire has containment lines that are holding on the west, north, and northeast flanks of the fires. These lines <br />
account for a large amount of containment of the fire. The north end of the Buckhead has burned into the <br />
south end of the Jack fire; fire crews are patrolling the area and mopping up where necessary to hold the <br />
lines. Today, fire managers will be looking for opportunities to secure the eastern edge. <br />
<br />
Near Minky Fire:  The Near Minky Fire is at 4,641 acres. This fire is located south of the Jack and Buckhead <br />
fires. The eastern edge and a portion of the western edge have been contained. The focus is now on the <br />
northwest corner and the southern end of the Near Minky. The Smith fire, located to the south and part of the <br />
Devil’s Knob complex, is actively growing northeast in the Ash Valley area. Northern Rockies Team 1 and <br />
Florida Red Team are working on a joint strategy for the Near Minky and Smith fires to limit western spread.  <br />
<br />
Weather:  Temperatures will be warmer this weekend, with highs in the 80’s and relative humidity in the upper <br />
teens to mid-20s. This will be warmer and drier weather than previously seen on the fire for the last ten days. <br />
Today, winds will be from the northeast, switching to north in the afternoon. Wind gusts will be up to 18 mph <br />
along ridgetops. This weather has the potential to increase fire activity on both the Rough Patch Complex and <br />
the Jack fire. Expect dense smoke in the lower elevations until the afternoon when winds shift to the north.</span>

 <br />
Kettle Falls, WA – Yesterday on the Bulldog Mountain fire, chipping of fuels along the northeast edge <br />
continued. Firefighters patrolled and took actions to hold the remainder of the fire within containment lines. <br />
<br />
Work will continue today to chip woody material and remove dangerous snags along the South Boulder Road <br />
as well as along the Davis Lake area. This work will prepare these roads as fire lines in the event that the fire <br />
moves out of its current footprint.  <br />
<br />
On the Mack Mountain fire, crews completed chipping operations along the 800 Road ahead of the eastern <br />
flank. Firefighters will continue to monitor and reinforce fire lines around the fire. Air resources will monitor <br />
both fires for active fire behavior. <br />
<br />
Yesterday the slightly cooler and windier weather provided more moisture over the fire areas as expected. In <br />
the weather forecast for the next few days, there will be a wind shift from northwest to southwest. With a new <br />
wind pattern and expected warmer temperatures, unburned fuels in the understory will show potential for <br />
increased fire behavior.    <br />
<br />
Citizens should remain vigilant and are strongly encouraged to sign up for alerts at  Ferry County Alerts.  <br />
Motorists traveling on Boulder Hwy and SR395 should watch for heavy equipment and firefighters turning off <br />
and onto the roadway. Firefighter and public safety is our number one priority.  <br />
<br />
Smoke: Current weather conditions will moderate smoke impacts throughout the area today.  <br />
<br />
Closures: An area closure is in effect on Colville National Forest lands in the vicinity of the Bulldog Mountain <br />
Fire. For more information on area and road closures on the Colville National Forest, please visit: <br />
https://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fseprd938379.pdf <br />
<br />
Citizens are asked to stay clear of the fire area and comply with area closures.  <br />
<br />
While current weather conditions provide respite from the extreme fire potential present in northeast <br />
Washington, the forest can quickly dry out again in the many weeks of fire season ahead. Please continue to <br />
do all you can to prevent wildfires. The Colville National Forest remains at IFPL level 3. Road closures remain <br />
in effect.  <br />
<br />
<br />
The Colville National Forest has gone from IFPL level 4 to IFPL level 3 as of today. Road closures remain in <br />
effect.  <br />
<br />
The Incident Command Post is located in Inchelium, WA. A spike camp will remain in place in Kettle Falls, WA <br />
to support the Bulldog Mountain and Mack Mountain Fires.</span>

<br />
WESTFIR, Ore. – Warmer weather and low humidities will test fire lines and challenge firefighters this <br />
weekend. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
For the past ten days, the fire has stayed on the ground and burned at relatively low intensities, according to <br />
Northwest Incident Management Team 13 Fire Behavior Analyst Dean Warner, but the change in weather will <br />
likely cause extreme fire behavior later today and tomorrow.  <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Lichen have become extremely dry and higher flame lengths could ignite them, carrying fire into the forest <br />
canopy. There is also potential for column development, torching and spotting across fire lines.  <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Line construction is progressing steadily around the Gales Fire footprint, especially along the western edge. <br />
Crews and heavy equipment are still building contingency and alternate lines around the northeast edge of <br />
the fire and laying hose in preparation for strategic ignitions. A total of five helicopters supported on-the-<br />
ground efforts Friday by cooling fire edges with water.  <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
On the Kwis Fire, interior burning will increase, but should not cross fire lines. Crews will continue to patrol <br />
and mop up to ensure its containment is not compromised. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Safety: Fuels are extra receptive and extreme caution should be taken during all outdoor recreation. Sparks <br />
from equipment, metal hitting rocks and hot exhaust systems parked over dry vegetation can start a fire. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Hunting: Archery deer and elk season begin today, which will increase the volume of traffic in non-closure <br />
areas on public lands. A large part of McKenzie Unit 19 lies within fire closure areas and will not be open to <br />
hunters. Full text of closure orders and maps on the Willamette National Forest can be found at <br />
https://go.usa.gov/xFEP2.  <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Evacuations: Level 1 and Level 3 evacuation orders remain in place. For current evacuation information and <br />
an interactive map of evacuation areas, visit: www.lanecounty.org.</span>

Current Situation: The Muckamuck Fire is 50% contained, with spread to the north limited due to suppression <br />
action. The priority is to increase control in the fire’s existing footprint with tactics that include hand line <br />
construction, burning vegetation and maintaining established dozer lines. Fire crews continue to mop up and <br />
back haul excess fire suppression equipment. On Friday, aviation personnel deployed infrared radar to <br />
determine and act upon hot spots and other areas with excessive heat, and crews on the ground reported <br />
some smoldering and hot spots near the 38 road.<br />
<br />
Weather: Friday was breezy with gusty northwest winds. Warming is expected this weekend as high pressure <br />
settles over the region. Anticipate drier weather with humidity between 20 and 30 percent. Winds are forecast <br />
to be light and terrain driven, with wind speeds under 15 mph.<br />

Northern Rockies Incident Management Team 1 took command of the Rough Patch Complex and Jack Fire at <br />
6:00 a.m. this morning. There is a new number for Fire Information: 541-482-1331. <br />
<br />
Summary:  The Rough Patch Complex and Jack Fire are being managed under a full suppression strategy <br />
using direct and indirect tactics to minimize fire spread to prevent loss of valuable resources. Leaders’ intent <br />
is to minimize any fire progression to the west and to protect private structures throughout the fire area. The <br />
Rough Patch consists of four fires: Chaos, Little Bend, Buckhead and Near Minky.  <br />
<br />
Chaos and Little Bend Fires:  The Chaos fire is at 15,301 acres and the Little Bend fire is at 6,573 acres. <br />
Fireline on the west side of the Chaos fire continues to hold. Crews are making progress on the northwest <br />
side of the fire constructing line from Shane Saddle to Bohemia Mountain. Structure protection needs are <br />
being evaluated north of the Chaos. Along the southern boundary of Chaos, line construction along the 3821 <br />
road continues toward the southern end of Little Bend. Crews are continuing to improve containment lines by <br />
conducting mop-up operations from previous days burnout. When conditions are favorable, firing operations <br />
will continue along this southern boundary toward the Little Bend.  <br />
<br />
Jack and Buckhead Fires:  The Jack fire is at 23,866 acres and the Buckhead fire is at 3,226 acres. The Jack <br />
fire has containment lines that are holding on the west, north, and northeast flanks of the fires. These lines <br />
account for a large amount of containment of the fire. The north end of the Buckhead has burned into the <br />
south end of the Jack fire; fire crews are patrolling the area and mopping up where necessary to hold the <br />
lines. Today, fire managers will be looking for opportunities to secure the eastern edge. <br />
<br />
Near Minky Fire:  The Near Minky Fire is at 4,641 acres. This fire is located south of the Jack and Buckhead <br />
fires. The eastern edge and a portion of the western edge have been contained. The focus is now on the <br />
northwest corner and the southern end of the Near Minky. The Smith fire, located to the south and part of the <br />
Devil’s Knob complex, is actively growing northeast in the Ash Valley area. Northern Rockies Team 1 and <br />
Florida Red Team are working on a joint strategy for the Near Minky and Smith fires to limit western spread.  <br />
<br />
Weather:  Temperatures will be warmer this weekend, with highs in the 80’s and relative humidity in the upper <br />
teens to mid-20s. This will be warmer and drier weather than previously seen on the fire for the last ten days. <br />
Today, winds will be from the northeast, switching to north in the afternoon. Wind gusts will be up to 18 mph <br />
along ridgetops. This weather has the potential to increase fire activity on both the Rough Patch Complex and <br />
the Jack fire. Expect dense smoke in the lower elevations until the afternoon when winds shift to the north.</span>

<br />
Yesterday: Forecasted northwest winds gusting to 20 mph delayed firing operations southeast of the fire area on <br />
Bethel Ridge on Washington Department of Natural Resources managed lands for most of the day. Winds <br />
moderated in the afternoon and crews were able to resume the firing operation and continued lighting through <br />
the evening hours. There was some increased fire behavior on the the northern portion of the fire, but crews and <br />
helicopters performing bucket drops were able to keep the fire in check without any issues. In the area of Cliffdell <br />
on the east flank of the fire, the fire became visible from Highway 410, with flames backing and material rolling <br />
down the steep slopes near the highway corridor.<br />
 <br />
Today: Gusty winds are predicted over the fire area again, which could delay the firing operation on the <br />
southeast portion of the fire. Fire managers want to ensure that this operation is completed in precise wind and <br />
weather conditions in order to be successful and will work with the Incident Meteorologist and Fire Behavior <br />
Analyst to ensure it is done in optimal conditions. Construction of indirect fire line continues west on Bethel Ridge <br />
to the William O. Douglas Wilderness boundary on the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest today. Dozers are <br />
connecting natural features on their way to Forest Road (FR) 199 and down FR 1500 to Wildcat Road area to <br />
contain the southern perimeter of the fire. Structure protection work continues north of the fire near the junction <br />
of Highway 410 and US 12 today. Crews will also be using heavy equipment where possible to improve indirect <br />
containment lines on Old River Road. Firefighters working the night shift will continue the important work of <br />
monitoring fire activity and structures in the Gold Creek and Bumping River areas on the north end of the fire and <br />
on the south, crews will be holding and securing the recently burned fire perimeter on Bethel Ridge.<br />
<br />
Evacuations: LEVEL 3: Bumping River Road from north to south; LEVEL 2: Hwy 410 from Bumping River Road <br />
to U.S. Route 12. LEVEL 1: From U.S. 12 at Hwy 410 west to Tieton Reservoir Road; Yakima County Office of <br />
Emergency Management’s official Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/YakimaCountyOEM. Yakima <br />

Inchelium, WA – Yesterday, sunny and windy weather with lower humidity returned forest fuels to a drier <br />
condition that supported fire in exposed areas of unburned fuels. Some active fire spread occurred as the fire <br />
backed toward containment lines along the north and northeast flanks.<br />
<br />
Firefighters worked to secure direct and indirect lines and conducted some small-scale burning operations to <br />
widen containment lines, supported by helicopter water drops. A small spot fire outside the perimeter was <br />
detected and suppressed on the north end. Mop-up and patrol continued around the southeast, south, and <br />
west flanks.<br />
<br />
A warming and drying trend will continue through the weekend. Sunday will be the warmest and driest day <br />
with temperatures near 80 degrees. Tuesday a cooling trend is expected to begin with a chance of rain. Fire <br />
behavior is expected to increase slightly with the warmer weather.<br />
<br />
Today, crews will continue to work on direct and indirect fire line on the north flank of the fire, preparing roads <br />
in the Lynx Mountain area to serve as contingency line, and patrolling and mopping up on the rest of the <br />
perimeter.<br />
<br />
On all unlined portions of the fire, the strategy is to build fire line as close to the fire’s edge as possible, and to <br />
strengthen these lines with small-scale burning where it can be effective.<br />
<br />
The Colville Reservation has reopened to industrial activities and the general public.<br />
<br />
While current weather conditions provide respite from the extreme fire potential present in northeast <br />
Washington, the forest can quickly dry out again in the many weeks of fire season ahead. Please continue to <br />
do all you can to prevent wildfires.<br />
<br />
Smoke: Current weather conditions will moderate fire behavior and smoke impacts throughout the area today.<br />

<br />
Early yesterday morning crews enroute to the morning briefing noticed a grass fire adjacent to South <br />
Lakeshore Road near Twentyfive Mile Creek State Park where a tree had fallen on a power line. Local Fire <br />
department was dispatched and initial attack was carried out by wildland engines using powerline fire safety <br />
protocol. Suppression and mop up was transferred to Chelan County Fire Department resources upon their <br />
arrival. <br />
<br />
Smoke seen in Chelan and Manson was from interior pockets of fuel burning within the perimeter. Active fire <br />
behavior was observed to the west of Darby Draw with Scooper Aircraft dropping water to slow the westward <br />
spread. Dozers will be deployed to this area today. Containment line was completed from Windy Saddle north <br />
to Crescent Hill. Some firefighters who have working from Spike Camps along Devil’s Backbone returned to <br />
base camp at end of shift. <br />
<br />
Today much of the northern perimeter will be in watch and hold status, while the area from Twentyfive Mile <br />
Creek State Park southward to near Fields Point Landing will be observed by an Unmanned Aerial System <br />
&#40;UAS&#41; to detect any remaining hot spots. Along Slide Ridge, line construction and improvement is planned to <br />
be completed by end of shift on Sunday; firing operations will be used as needed. Structural protection <br />
resources will continue to improve water delivery systems. Crews who have been in Spike Camps along <br />
Devil’s Backbone will return to base camp at the end of shift. <br />
<br />
Moderate to active fire behavior can be expected today with westward expansion anticipated. Smoke will <br />
likely be visible from Lake Chelan and the surrounding communities. <br />
<br />
Fields Point Landing is open to the public for ferry pick up and drop off only. Fire support operations are <br />
ongoing at Fields Point. Members of the public are reminded to yield to fire traffic and to stay in areas clearly <br />
marked for public use. <br />
<br />
Rotor and fixed-wing air resources will continue to be available to support ground crews.  Aircraft may use <br />
local bodies of water, including Lake Chelan. Recreational boaters should be aware of aircraft takeoff and <br />
landings and keep a safe distance.<br />
<br />
The Twentyfive Mile Fire was first reported at 3:45 p.m. on August 15, 2021. The fire was initially burning on <br />
the south shore of Lake Chelan near Twentyfive Mile Creek and has expanded south and west of the area. <br />
The fire is under joint jurisdiction of the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest, Washington Department of <br />
Natural Resources, Bureau of Land Management and Chelan County Fire District 7.<br />
<br />
Weather: Sunny and warm with lowering humidity and calm winds expected. <br />
<br />
Evacuations: The most up-to-date evacuation information is available through Chelan County Emergency <br />
Management at the following links. Current evacuation levels remained in place overnight and will continue <br />
throughout the day. The Chelan County Sherriff will update evacuation levels as conditions warrant.</span>

The Chickadee Creek Fire is located approximately 15 miles west of Tonasket, Washington. The Walker <br />
Creek Fire is located approximately 13 miles east/northeast of Tonasket, Washington, surrounding Lake <br />
Bonaparte. The Incident Command Post at the Omak Stampede Grounds is closed to all but essential <br />
personnel to help ensure the health and safety of community members and firefighters. There will be a <br />
warming and drying trend over the weekend, with temperatures today ranging from 70 to 80 degrees.<br />
 <br />
Operations - Fire crews and equipment are being shifted around both fires internally as assignments are <br />
completed to allow the most efficient use of resources:<br />
 <br />
Chickadee Creek Fire<br />
Fire crews are continuing mop-up on the western fire perimeter. Firefighters completed additional dozer line <br />
on the northern fire edge yesterday and prepared areas for burnout operations to secure containment lines. <br />
Fire crews built direct dozer line up against the fire’s edge on the southern portion of the fire, working to keep <br />
the fire in the smallest possible footprint. Helicopter water bucket drops cooled hot spots on the eastern edge <br />
of the fire. A burnout operation is planned today above the road on the eastern fire edge, to remove pockets of <br />
unburned fuels and secure the fire line.<br />
 <br />
Walker Creek Fire<br />
Firefighters completed a section of indirect line along the northwestern fire perimeter. Fire crews are mopping <br />
up the northeastern fire edge and are building direct fire line along the eastern fire perimeter to minimize the <br />
fire size. Firefighters continued mop-up work along the southern fire perimeter and patrolled to locate and <br />
extinguish remaining heat sources near the fire line yesterday. Today, fire crews will continue to mop-up and <br />
patrol across the fire and will construct direct fire line in areas where it is feasible.<br />
 <br />
Evacuations<br />
Evacuation levels decreased on both fires today. For details, see the Okanogan County Emergency <br />
