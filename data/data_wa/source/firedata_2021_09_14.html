Current Status: Recent cool and damp weather has kept fire activity moderated. A Distributed Real-Time Infrared <br />
(DRTI) flight as well as an overnight infrared (IR) flight mapped an increase of only 601 acres over the past <br />
couple of days. Along the eastern side of the fire crews increased the depth of mop up working from the edge of <br />
the containment line. Firefighters monitored and patrolled the southeast corner and did not see fire movement. <br />
Crews patrolled the northeast corner and the containment line to the west searching for any hot spots or heat <br />
that could threaten the line. The fire continued to creep, smolder, and torch trees in the Upper Dickey Creek, <br />
Mother Lode Creek, and Battle drainages. Helicopter bucket water drops were used to slow fire spread in these <br />
areas on the northwest corner of the fire. On the south side the fire slowly backed downslope in the Elk Lake <br />
Creek and East Humbug Creek drainages. Firefighters monitored the fire movement and tested the tanks, <br />
pumps, and hose lines set up on the primary line. Firefighters continued mop up work along Forest Road 4696. <br />
Crews and equipment prepared primary and contingency lines on road systems and hand lines north and <br />
northwest of the fire as part of the long-term fire suppression strategy. <br />
<br />
Planned Actions: The weather conditions will moderate fire activity today. Vegetation and woody debris continue <br />
to be extremely dry which will allow occasional surface fire, some group tree torching, smoldering, and creeping <br />
fire movement. Fire movement upslope as well as backing downslopes is expected to slowly continue in the <br />
drainages. Most of the fire activity will continue in the Upper Dickey Creek, Mother Lode Creek, Pansey Creek, <br />
and Battle Creek drainages. Crews will test pumps and hoses along the primary line below the East Humbug <br />
Creek and Elk Lake Creek drainages. Five helicopters remain assigned to the fire and will be used for aerial <br />
suppression action. Crews and Engines will patrol and monitor along the south and east sides of the fire. <br />
Equipment and crews will be used to prepare primary lines on road systems north and northwest of the fire. The <br />
existing containment lines will be strengthened as firefighters watch for any trees or pockets of heat that could <br />
threaten the lines. <br />
<br />
Weather: The weather forecast outlines seasonable conditions today with temperatures 62-72 degrees, minimum <br />
humidity levels from 35% to 50%, and winds out of the west/northwest at 5-10 mph with gusts up to 20 mph in <br />
the afternoon. <br />
<br />
Temporary Flight Restriction (TFR): There is a TFR in place for air space over the Bull Complex (FDC 1-2073) to <br />
reduce impacts to fire aviation operations. Fire aviation response is halted or delayed if an unauthorized aircraft <br />
enters the TFR. Temporary flight restrictions also apply to unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) or drones. If you fly, <br />
we can’t! <br />
<br />
Evacuations:  The Marion County Sheriff has issued a Level 1 “Be Ready” evacuation advisory only for <br />
Breitenbush Hot Springs. Residents should be aware of the danger that exists in their area, monitor emergency <br />
services websites and local media, and make an action plan should the evacuation level rise. The advisory can <br />
be viewed at:  https://www.flashalert.net/id/MarionSheriff?alert=1.  <br />
<br />
Closures:  For the safety of wildland firefighters and the public, the National Forests have enacted area closures <br />
that prevent the public from being upon National Forest System lands in the vicinity of the Bull Complex Fire. All <br />
Forest lands that are south and west of Forest Road 46, and east of the Riverside Fire perimeter are closed. The <br />
entire length of Forest Road 46 is closed. Lands within the 2020 Lionshead and Beachie Creek Fire areas are <br />
also closed.  See the closure orders and maps at https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/closures/7773/.</span>

<br />
Cedar Creek, Cub Creek 2, and Delancy Fires September 10, 2021 Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest<br />
<br />
Minimal fire behavior occurred in the Cedar Creek Fire this week, with limited isolated creeping and some <br />
torching in the Varden Creek drainage and near Slate Lake.   On the Cub Creek 2 Fire, some creeping has been <br />
observed around the Farewell and Lake Creek vicinity. No activity was observed on the Delancy Fire. Cooler <br />
temperatures and higher humidities are expected across both fires this weekend, reducing the likelihood of active <br />
fire behavior and smoke production for the next few days.<br />
<br />
Crews and heavy equipment continue to complete suppression repair across both fire areas, repairing firelines, <br />
felling hazard trees along roads, chipping debris, and repairing roads damaged by suppression activity. The <br />
shortage of personnel and equipment nationally, plus the need to prioritize these resources for active fires with <br />
immediate suppression needs, have slowed the progress of this work on the Cedar Creek and Cub Creek 2 fires. <br />
<br />
Closure Area Update:<br />
<br />
In the Cedar Creek Fire area, the existing closure order remains unchanged for the next week. As of September <br />
10, the closure order for the Cub Creek 2 Fire has changed:<br />
<br />
·       Forest Service Roads 51 and 5160 (west of the Chewuch River) from Eightmile Ranch to Andrews Creek <br />
Trailhead are now open.<br />
<br />
·       Andrews Creek Trailhead and all trails leaving from this site are now open, including Andrews Creek, Little <br />
Andrews Creek, Coleman Ridge, and Fire Creek. Past Andrews Creek Trailhead, the road to Thirtymile Trailhead <br />
remains closed to allow for completion of road repair work that was scheduled for July but deferred because of <br />
fire activity. All other roads, trails, and trailheads in the existing closure order remain closed as crews continue to <br />
complete suppression repair and remove hazardous trees.<br />
<br />
·       Camp 4 Campground is now open.<br />
<br />
·       All other campgrounds, dispersed campsites, and trails in the Cub Creek 2 Fire closure area remain closed, <br />
including Falls Creek and Chewuch Campgrounds and the trail to Falls Creek Falls.<br />
<br />
Visit USFS Pacific Northwest Region Emergency Closures for locations and details of current closures. Fire <br />
closure orders and maps are also available here. As more suppression repair work is completed over the next <br />
week, district staff will re-assess the extent of closure orders across both fires to look for more opportunities to <br />
open areas and trails. Meanwhile, we appreciate your patience and respect for these closures to ensure the <br />
safety of our firefighters and visitors.<br />
<br />

Firefighters continue to make progress on lining the 230 miles of fire perimeter of the Cougar Peak Fire. The <br />
Oregon State Fire Marshal’s office had four task forces of 16 engines and 4 water tenders continuing efforts of <br />
securing and prepping structures. The task forces also worked the fire line on the northeast side by putting in <br />
hose lays, mopping up and cold trailing. Fire activity in the area of Willow Springs ranch became active again <br />
today and the crews were able to stop forward spread at one acre, saving the last 150 acres of unburned <br />
pasture. Protection of the communication sites, tracking cattle, and haystacks remain a priority. <br />
<br />
Along the southern edge of the fire, wildland fire resources continue to make great progress putting in hand and <br />
dozer line around the fire. Crews are building line as close to the fire’s edge as possible. Indirect line will be built <br />
in areas along the southern and western sides of the fire, due to difficult terrain and dangerous hazard trees. <br />
Burnout operations are planned in the future to secure those lines. A small fire camp will be going up in Paisley to <br />
support the western side of the fire. <br />
<br />
Dozer and hand lines have been completed along most of the eastern side, however, winds over the next couple <br />
days are expected to test the eastern edge of the fire. Crews have been working to mop-up hotspots closest to <br />
the line in preparation for the expected winds. Great progress has been made on the southeast corner of the fire, <br />
it is now mopped in 25 feet. With the clearer air this afternoon helicopters were able to fly and help support the <br />
firefighters in containment efforts. <br />
<br />
Behavior: With the clear skies and warm temperatures, fuels in the fire area are drying and patches of unburned <br />
fuels within the fire perimeter are now burning. Smoke from these areas will be visible. Fire resources will be on <br />
the lookout for possible torching and spotting of unburned fuels due to wind changes.</span>

Cedar Creek, Cub Creek 2, and Delancy Fires September 10, 2021 Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest<br />
<br />
Minimal fire behavior occurred in the Cedar Creek Fire this week, with limited isolated creeping and some <br />
torching in the Varden Creek drainage and near Slate Lake.   On the Cub Creek 2 Fire, some creeping has been <br />
observed around the Farewell and Lake Creek vicinity. No activity was observed on the Delancy Fire. Cooler <br />
temperatures and higher humidities are expected across both fires this weekend, reducing the likelihood of active <br />
fire behavior and smoke production for the next few days.<br />
<br />
Crews and heavy equipment continue to complete suppression repair across both fire areas, repairing firelines, <br />
felling hazard trees along roads, chipping debris, and repairing roads damaged by suppression activity. The <br />
shortage of personnel and equipment nationally, plus the need to prioritize these resources for active fires with <br />
immediate suppression needs, have slowed the progress of this work on the Cedar Creek and Cub Creek 2 fires. <br />
<br />
Closure Area Update:<br />
<br />
In the Cedar Creek Fire area, the existing closure order remains unchanged for the next week. As of September <br />
10, the closure order for the Cub Creek 2 Fire has changed:<br />
<br />
·       Forest Service Roads 51 and 5160 (west of the Chewuch River) from Eightmile Ranch to Andrews Creek <br />
Trailhead are now open.<br />
<br />
·       Andrews Creek Trailhead and all trails leaving from this site are now open, including Andrews Creek, Little <br />
Andrews Creek, Coleman Ridge, and Fire Creek. Past Andrews Creek Trailhead, the road to Thirtymile Trailhead <br />
remains closed to allow for completion of road repair work that was scheduled for July but deferred because of <br />
fire activity. All other roads, trails, and trailheads in the existing closure order remain closed as crews continue to <br />
complete suppression repair and remove hazardous trees.<br />
<br />
·       Camp 4 Campground is now open.<br />
<br />
·       All other campgrounds, dispersed campsites, and trails in the Cub Creek 2 Fire closure area remain closed, <br />
including Falls Creek and Chewuch Campgrounds and the trail to Falls Creek Falls.<br />
<br />
Visit USFS Pacific Northwest Region Emergency Closures for locations and details of current closures. Fire <br />
closure orders and maps are also available here. As more suppression repair work is completed over the next <br />
week, district staff will re-assess the extent of closure orders across both fires to look for more opportunities to <br />
open areas and trails. Meanwhile, we appreciate your patience and respect for these closures to ensure the <br />
safety of our firefighters and visitors.<br />
<br />

As expected, fire activity remained consistent with the past few days with minimal perimeter fire growth. <br />
Firefighters took advantage of the cool temperatures and elevated humidity by adding fireline depth through firing <br />
operations in Division H of the Big Hamlin Fire and Division F on the Smith Fire. Heavy equipment also <br />
supported operations through the continued construction of indirect firelines in Divisions G and A and finished <br />
line construction to the north in Division G.    <br />
<br />
Weather will be similar to yesterday, ranging between 70 and 80 degrees, but humidity will drop by about 3-5%. <br />
The area is in a Pacific flow pattern resulting in weather that changes daily and differs across the complex; both <br />
temperature and humidity have changes ranging from 10-12, degrees and percent, respectively. Weather <br />
continues to be a significant driver of fire behavior. With so much variation across the landscape, fire activity can <br />
be different on two adjacent ridges, and result in less predictability for firefighters. Firefighters mitigate for this <br />
variability through constant observation of both the weather and fire behavior.  In the coming days, weather will <br />
become increasingly hotter and drier, punctuated with a day of lower temperatures and higher humidity on <br />
Wednesday.     <br />
<br />
Today, fire behavior is expected to be sluggish in the morning while humidity is high and temperatures cool and <br />
then increase throughout the day proportionate with rising temperatures and falling humidity.  The presence of <br />
smoke below 4000’ elevation may also play a role in moderating fire behavior where it is prevalent.  Firefighters <br />
will continue the work of the last several days with careful observation of localized weather and its impact on fire <br />
behavior.      <br />
<br />
Evacuation Notices: <br />
The Ash Creek-South Umpqua Road remains at a Level 3: Go (Leave immediately). As of 8 am on September <br />
11, Dumont 2810 to Jackson Creek was reduced to Level 1: Be Ready. The interactive web map depicts <br />
evacuation areas and levels: https://dcor.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?<br />

Please, stay clear of firefighting operations and drive safely! The public should watch out for fire crews and <br />
equipment while traveling on forest roads. Some roads remain closed with barriers. Barriers are in place to <br />
protect firefighters and the public, so please respect the closed areas. <br />
<br />
Stay clear of fire-blackened areas for the many unseen hazards that exist, including live green, fire-weakened, <br />
trees which may fall without warning, and scalding hot stump holes.  Please maintain situational awareness of <br />
your surroundings when traveling and hiking in fire-damaged forests. <br />
<br />
Yesterday: Firefighters continued to focus on SW and SE, continued assessments further out, and monitored and <br />
observed remote areas of southern perimeter. Firefighters continued to hold and improve completed lines to the <br />
west, continued to hold and improve completed lines to the south. Firefighters provided continued point <br />
protection of assets and resources.  <br />
<br />
Today: Firefighters will continue to patrol, mop up, and eliminate hot spots throughout fire perimeter. Additionally, <br />
rehab of dozer line and mastication of downed vegetation are planned.  <br />
<br />

<br />
Incident Summary:  The Great Basin Incident Management Team 2 took command of the Rough Patch Complex <br />
and Jack Fires at 6:00 a.m. Both fires are being managed under a full suppression strategy using containment <br />
and confinement tactics to minimize fire spread to prevent loss of valuable resources.  Objectives include <br />
keeping the fires as small as possible while working toward full containment. <br />
<br />
Weather in the area is forecast to be cooler and more humid. Some precipitation was received across the fire <br />
Thursday night, with .10 to .30 inches of rain received in some locations.  It is predicted to remain at these <br />
seasonably lower temperatures for the next few days. Weather conditions east of the Cascades could bring more <br />
humidity and cloud cover to the fire area, perhaps even some drizzle on Friday. These changes reflect the typical <br />
patterns for this time of year and may have the potential to diminish fire activity, especially if prolonged over <br />
several days.  <br />
<br />
Chaos and Little Bend Fires:  The Chaos fire is at 24,462 acres and the Little Bend Creek Fire is at 8,569 acres.  <br />
On the north end of the Chaos Fire, firefighters assessed the spot fire that crossed the 2460 road.   It is currently <br />
burning at approximately three acres. With the very steep and rugged landscape in mind, crews have identified <br />
specific terrain features they are using in efforts to contain the spot and minimize its growth. Helicopters continue <br />
to support this priority with water drops and reconnaissance flights. On the southeast section of the Little Bend <br />
Creek Fire, crews are utilizing the 3816 road as a primary control line after the fire crossed over a section of the <br />
3850 road on Tuesday. <br />
<br />
Jack and Buckhead Fires:  The Jack Fire is at 23,990 acres and the Buckhead fire is at 6,536 acres.  The Jack <br />
Fire is contained along the west, north, and northeast perimeter. The fire has not grown for several days.  Fire <br />
crews are assessing the eastern edge for direct control operations. Firefighters are focusing on the southwest <br />
corner of the Buckhead Fire near the 100 road where they have contained small spot fires that resulted also <br />
during Tuesday’s wind event.  Due to the proximity of the Smith Fire, which is part of the Devil’s Knob Complex, <br />
close coordination is ongoing between the two Incident Management Teams managing each complex.  <br />
<br />
Near Minky Fire:  The Near Minky Fire is at 4,867 acres.  This fire lays south of the Jack and Buckhead Fires.  <br />
The entire perimeter is contained except for the northwest corner, which is where it connects to the Buckhead <br />
Fire. Activity has been minimal for approximately two weeks. <br />
<br />
Closures:  Copies of all closures and maps can be found at https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/closures/7758/. <br />
<br />
Amended BLM Roseburg District fire closure: BLM road 24-1-26 (Francis Creek) from the junction with BLM road <br />

The UAS (drone) was utilized yesterday and was successful in locating, mapping and estimating sizes of the <br />
spot fires in Nehi Creek. There are three spots, outside the main body of fire but within the primary lines; one <br />
approximately 25 acres, another approximately 20 acres and one approximately 3-5 acres. The 3-5 acre spot is <br />
on the east side of the creek. The UAS was unable to deploy the plastic spheres, as planned to fire a pocket of <br />
unburned fuel in Division W, due to mechanical issues.  <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Crews were able to work directly on the fire’s edge in the vicinity of Helispot 13 and construct handline to the <br />
south and then to the north and tie in with FS 646. The work along the 1926 road has been completed and will <br />
serve as a contingency line in case the spot fires in Nehi Creek decide to move east. Improving the 1925 Road <br />
and connecting it to the 1926 Road will be completed today. This will serve as a contingency line for the <br />
southeast corner.  <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Weather: There was excellent humidity recovery last night ranging from 85% to 100% over the fire. We will <br />
experience slightly cooler high temperatures, 65-70 degrees today as a result of a weak cold frontal passage. <br />
Expect to see clearer skies and warming temperatures for Tuesday and Wednesday as high pressure builds in.  <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Smoke: Today will be very similar to yesterday. Most areas will see 'Good' or 'Moderate' air quality, with a few <br />
periods of smoke in the afternoon. Oakridge, Fall Creek, and areas closest to the fire will see the most smoke, <br />
possibly at 'USG' or 'Unhealthy' levels, around mid-day and late afternoon. Smoke from other large fires in <br />
Oregon and California should stay to our south. https://oregonsmoke.blogspot.com/  or  https://fire.airnow.gov/.       <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Safety:  We are seeing increased fire traffic on road 21 with other fire resources using Hills Creek. Please keep a <br />
safe distance when traveling as logs and other materials continue to be hauled out.  <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Closures: Roads 24, 19 and 18 still remain closed in the area. Please visit <br />
https://www.fs.usda.gov/alerts/willamette/alerts-notices for information on additional closures and maps.</span>

Incident Summary:  The Great Basin Incident Management Team 2 took command of the Rough Patch Complex <br />
and Jack Fires at 6:00 a.m. Both fires are being managed under a full suppression strategy using containment <br />
and confinement tactics to minimize fire spread to prevent loss of valuable resources.  Objectives include <br />
keeping the fires as small as possible while working toward full containment. <br />
<br />
Weather in the area is forecast to be cooler and more humid. Some precipitation was received across the fire <br />
Thursday night, with .10 to .30 inches of rain received in some locations.  It is predicted to remain at these <br />
seasonably lower temperatures for the next few days. Weather conditions east of the Cascades could bring more <br />
humidity and cloud cover to the fire area, perhaps even some drizzle on Friday. These changes reflect the typical <br />
patterns for this time of year and may have the potential to diminish fire activity, especially if prolonged over <br />
several days.  <br />
<br />
Chaos and Little Bend Fires:  The Chaos fire is at 24,462 acres and the Little Bend Creek Fire is at 8,569 acres.  <br />
On the north end of the Chaos Fire, firefighters assessed the spot fire that crossed the 2460 road.   It is currently <br />
burning at approximately three acres. With the very steep and rugged landscape in mind, crews have identified <br />
specific terrain features they are using in efforts to contain the spot and minimize its growth. Helicopters continue <br />
to support this priority with water drops and reconnaissance flights. On the southeast section of the Little Bend <br />
Creek Fire, crews are utilizing the 3816 road as a primary control line after the fire crossed over a section of the <br />
3850 road on Tuesday. <br />
<br />
Jack and Buckhead Fires:  The Jack Fire is at 23,990 acres and the Buckhead fire is at 6,536 acres.  The Jack <br />
Fire is contained along the west, north, and northeast perimeter. The fire has not grown for several days.  Fire <br />
crews are assessing the eastern edge for direct control operations. Firefighters are focusing on the southwest <br />
corner of the Buckhead Fire near the 100 road where they have contained small spot fires that resulted also <br />
during Tuesday’s wind event.  Due to the proximity of the Smith Fire, which is part of the Devil’s Knob Complex, <br />
close coordination is ongoing between the two Incident Management Teams managing each complex.  <br />
<br />
Near Minky Fire:  The Near Minky Fire is at 4,867 acres.  This fire lays south of the Jack and Buckhead Fires.  <br />
The entire perimeter is contained except for the northwest corner, which is where it connects to the Buckhead <br />
Fire. Activity has been minimal for approximately two weeks. <br />
<br />
Closures:  Copies of all closures and maps can be found at https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/closures/7758/. <br />
<br />
Amended BLM Roseburg District fire closure: BLM road 24-1-26 (Francis Creek) from the junction with BLM road <br />
25-1E-31 (Canton Creek Road) North to the Roseburg District Boundary in Township 24 South Range 1 West <br />
Section 1 will remain closed. <br />
<br />
The Umpqua and Willamette National Forests have temporarily closed areas of both forests due to the Jack Fire, <br />
Rough Patch Complex Fire, and Devil's Knob Complex Fire. <br />
<br />
Highway 138 between Roseburg and Diamond remains open. Expect short delays for hazard tree removal <br />
operations east of Glide. Slow down and be alert.</span>

<br />
Yesterday:  Yakima Valley Emergency Management lowered areas previously under a Level 3 evacuation to <br />
Level 2. Fire progression was minimal due to favorable terrain and weather conditions. Last night’s winds were <br />
stronger in Yakima Valley than on the fire. Fire continues to be active in the northern sections of the fire, backing <br />
downslope and burning in heavier fuel types. Nightshift firefighters used firing operations to create a new fireline <br />
from an anchor point northwest of Cliffdell toward the junction of Forest Road 1706 and Highway 410. To reduce <br />
the distance between active wildfire and cabins and homes in the north portion of the Highway 410 corridor, <br />
firefighters used firing operations to strengthen the fireline along the east west portion of FR 1706 near Swamp <br />
Creek. Air resources supported day operations. Structure protection, including hose lays and fuels reduction <br />
work, continued near Goose Prairie and areas near Cliffdell.<br />
<br />
Today:  Cooler, drier conditions are forecasted across the area today, with potential for down valley wind gusts <br />
that may contribute to a slight increase in fire behavior. Firefighters will maintain their focus on the northern <br />
sections of the fire to secure line from east to west. Crews plan to work further north of Edgar Rock, <br />
strengthening dozer and handline to anchor the northeast area of the fire near Cliffdell. Structure protection will <br />
remain another primary focus in both the Bumping Lake/Goose Prairie and Cliffdell areas. Operations within the <br />
William O. Douglas area are expected to continue utilizing Burnt Mountain as an anchor point to prevent further <br />
growth.<br />
<br />
Evacuations:  LEVEL 2: Bumping River Road corridor from north to south; Highway 410 corridor from Salmon <br />
Cove to Pinecliff; LEVEL 1: Highway 410 corridor from Pinecliff to the junction of U.S. Route 12, and from U.S. <br />
12 at Hwy 410 west to Tieton Reservoir Rd. See map at Yakima Valley Emergency Management: <br />

<br />
In preparation for a transition to a local Type 3 organization on Wednesday, firefighters are continuing with <br />
backhaul operations across the fire area to retrieve excess hose lines, heavy equipment, and supplies. The <br />
rainstorm has proven beneficial in reducing fire behavior, although some areas are drying out after receiving <br />
more direct sunlight yesterday. The Suppression Repair Group is focusing their efforts on the area north of Brush <br />
Mountain. Increased traffic is likely on roadways surrounding the fire area as logs are transported to nearby mills.   <br />
 <br />
Operations: Containment has increased around the fire area as portions of the perimeter have cooled after <br />
recent rain and firefighter mop-up efforts. Along the western flank, crews backhauled hose lines, mopped up <br />
remaining hot spots, and patrolled the perimeter. From the interior, several miles of hose, equipment, and <br />
supplies were backhauled along Sitdown Creek Road. The northern portion of the fire remains in patrol status <br />
while crews pull hose line and move heavy equipment to various staging areas. From Stall Creek to Little White <br />
Mountain, crews were able to reengage the handline and perform mop-up procedures. On the east side, the area <br />
from Bear Springs to Lynx Mountain was relatively quiet with only a few smoldering areas discovered near <br />
Bitterroot Mountain. Lynx Mountain continues to smolder from the burnout operations performed over a week <br />
ago. As fuels dry out, increased smoke from smoldering areas will allow for easier detection as crews seek out <br />
and extinguish remaining hot spots. The Suppression Repair Group is processing trees, consolidating log decks, <br />
and identifying roads in need of repair. Aviation resources remain available to respond to any new fire starts or <br />
medical emergencies. <br />
<br />
Weather: Slightly warmer and drier weather is expected today, although temperatures will still remain seasonably <br />
mild. Similar weather conditions are expected Tuesday, but some subtle changes are expected on Wednesday <br />
with the passage of another weak cold front. A few showers may accompany the cold front followed by breezy <br />
west to northwest winds in the afternoon. Thursday will be rain-free and mild, but rain will likely return to the <br />
region on Friday. <br />
<br />
<br />
Safety: The health and safety of firefighters and the public is the first priority. The public is strongly encouraged to <br />
stay safely clear of the active fire area. Firefighters are conducting operations under protocols to mitigate the risk <br />
of COVID-19.  <br />
<br />
Smoke: Smoke from the Summit Trail Fire, along with other fires in the region, may be visible in the area <br />
surrounding Inchelium. An interactive smoke map at https://wasmoke.blogspot.com/ allows you to zoom into your <br />
location to see the latest smoke information. Smoke-sensitive individuals and people with respiratory problems or <br />
heart disease are encouraged to take precautionary measures.</span>

<br />
Yesterday: With sunshine and increased winds drying out fuels following recent rainfall, burnout operations were <br />
successfully resumed Sunday afternoon. Favorable winds helped firefighters gain up to 300 feet of depth along <br />
the fire line on Devils Backbone toward Stormy Mountain. The fire burned actively in pockets of unburned <br />
vegetation that were well within the perimeter in the Twenty-five Mile Creek drainage and the tributary to the <br />
north. Early in the evening, a large root wad flared up near the fireline, requiring five helicopter bucket loads of <br />
water to fully saturate it and ensure it could not ignite spot fires by rolling outside the line. Monitoring continued <br />
on the inactive eastern edge, while firefighters worked to break-down and remove hoselays and equipment from <br />
the north and northwestern sections to return and refurbish it for use on other fires.<br />
 <br />
Today: Work will continue to connect and strengthen fireline northward along the Devils Backbone toward Angle <br />
Peak. Aerial ignitions will involve the use of a helicopter mounted plastic sphere dispenser (PSD) that distributes <br />
spheres about the shape and size of ping pong balls. The plastic spheres contain potassium permanganate and <br />
are injected with ethylene glycol (antifreeze). A chemical reaction causes the sphere to ignite approximately 20 to <br />
30 seconds after injection. A short video describing PSD use is available at www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iPNOw-<br />
oQgo.<br />
<br />
Use of aerial ignition helps to limit firefighter exposure to risk in this steep and rocky area by reducing time <br />
needed to burn. As vegetation becomes more sparse along the northwest edge, firefighters continue to assess <br />
options to solidify the fire’s edge before fall weather patterns begin to limit options. Meanwhile, on the fire’s <br />
northwest and northern perimeter, firefighters continue work to mop up, chip, and remove hoses, pumps, and <br />
other equipment that is no longer needed to contain the fire in that area.<br />
<br />
Weather and Fire Behavior: Lighter winds and sunshine, along with slightly lower relative humidity, is forecasted <br />
today. Winds are expected to slowly move fire along in alignment with area landscape features, with an easterly <br />
flow in the morning shifting to west/southwest in the early afternoon wind speeds of 5 to 10 ridgetops.<br />
<br />
Evacuations: Level 1 (Be Ready): All properties along South Lakeshore Road (from just north of Lake Chelan <br />
State Park to the end of the roadway), First Creek Road and Granite Falls Road. A map of current evacuation <br />
levels is available at: bit.ly/2WhU9Nu and additional information is available from Chelan County Emergency <br />
Management (facebook.com/ccsoem/).</span>

<br />
Yesterday, crews pushed in the fire line from the USFS 3230 road to Antoine Creek, along the northwest flank of <br />
Bonaparte Mountain.  Fire behavior in this area continues to be minimal, which is allowing crews to engage in <br />
direct line on the fire, where safe to do so.  Fallers have been working on removing fire weakened trees along <br />
roads and behind the cabins on the west side of Bonaparte Lake. <br />
<br />
Today, crews will continue to scout out areas for indirect line towards the USFS 300 road, on the northwest flank <br />
of Bonaparte Mountain.  Repairs crews will be utilizing excavators and dozers, as well as hand crews, to work on <br />
suppression dozer and hand lines where they can impact water resources or on steep slopes. <br />
<br />
Road closures are in effect for the fire area and law enforcement will be patrolling the closed roads.  Water <br />
tenders and road graders will be maintaining access roads throughout the fire area as well as fallers evaluating <br />
and removing fire weakened trees.  For public and fire fighter safety, please help keep everyone safe and stay <br />
out of the fire area.  <br />
<br />
 The weather is expected to be dry and mostly clear for Monday and Tuesday with near normal temperatures.  <br />
With a higher relative humidity, moderating temperatures and shrinking burn window, fire behavior is continued to <br />
be minimal throughout the week.<br />
<br />
Evacuation levels have been reduced to level 1 throughout the area.</span>
