Road Closures:  <br />
Washington Department of Transportation (WSDOT) has completed felling operations along the Highway 2 corridor and currently plan <br />
to open the highway on Monday. We want to remind the public that firefighters are still operating along the side of the road. Please <br />
follow all posted speed limits and expect delays. For the most current information about the highway closure, please check <br />
https://wsdot.com/travel/real-time/alerts/road/002. <br />
<br />
At this time, Highway 2 remains closed just east of Index Galena Road near Sunset Falls (MP 36), to the junction of 5th St. N into the <br />
town of Skykomish (MP 49). Local highway access is permitted for residents with identification from the west closure at Index-Galena <br />
Road to the Money Creek tunnel.  Highway 2 from the west end of Money Creek Tunnel to 5th Street in Skykomish remains closed to <br />
all.   <br />
<br />
<br />
Update: <br />
<br />
Activity continues to be moderate on the east side of the fire near Skykomish. Firefighting tactics include monitoring for rollout and fire <br />
backing down steep hillsides to areas that are more accessible for firefighting operations. Crews are monitoring firelines and prepping <br />
structures to protect against rollout debris. The west side of the fire is backing down the mountain and working its way toward <br />
containment lines. Large fuels continue to burn and smolder within the control perimeter, making it more visible at night. A night shift <br />
patrol is in place to monitor this activity.     <br />
<br />
Today’s weather will be partly sunny with light winds west 5-6 MPH. Relative humidity's will remain in the mid 60’s with maximum temps <br />
around 65 degrees. <br />

Firefighters are completing containment lines in key areas of the fire, while mopping up and rehabilitating lines in areas that are fully <br />
secured. <br />
<br />
Saw lines have been completed in the northwest corner of the fire where vegetation was too dense to effectively build handline or dozer <br />
lines. Instead, firefighters used chain saws to cut down or thin out heavy brush, tree limbs, and trees to disrupt fuel continuity.  <br />
<br />
On the northeast part of the incident some dozer lines still need to be cleaned up and repaired. <br />
<br />
Mop-up, gridding for heat, suppression repair and rehabilitation are simultaneously taking place around the fire perimeter. This work <br />
includes removing brush/slash from road shoulders and grading where necessary.  The incident has begun the removal process of <br />
dispersed equipment across the incident this process is known as backhaul.  This back-haul process includes the gathering up of <br />
supplies and equipment no longer needed for suppressing the fire. Another important step is removing signage, flagging tape and other <br />
debris established during suppression operations. The goal of this work is to provide restoration to the landscape to the greatest extent <br />
possible, post fire. <br />
<br />
“Suppression repair is an important process toward finalizing our suppression work for the Boulder Mountain fire, and we want to finish <br />
our assignment strong,” said Bill Neckels, incident commander trainee for Northwest 13 IMT.   <br />
<br />
Weather was cooler on Friday as temperatures were cooler than seasonal norms for this time of year. Forecasted Weather, is predicting <br />
a return to warmer and drier conditions for the weekend, which could stimulate interior consumption but not jeopardize containment <br />
lines. <br />
<br />
Closures: An area closure remains in place for the Boulder Mountain Fire on the Colville National Forest. For a map and complete <br />
description of the closure area, including a list of trails and roads, go to https://www.fs.usda.gov/alerts/colville/alerts-notices.</span>

West Zone Operations: Fire activity within the perimeter of the Cedar Creek Fire is expected to increase with the warming and drying <br />
weather. Ridgetops within the fire area are expected to dry out quicker and, therefore have active fire sooner than lower elevations. <br />
Crews and mechanized equipment continue work on the north side of the fire to prepare Forest Service Road 19 as a containment line. <br />
Firefighters are actively searching for areas of heat and any remaining hazards such as snags along the western edge of the fire. The <br />
control line to the south and southwest of the fire is prepared with cleared vegetation and is ready for future burning operations.  <br />
<br />
During aerial reconnaissance flights, firefighters were able to look at some of the recreation sites and other special sites within the fire <br />
area. Many of these sites are in the interior of the fire and cannot be safely accessed on the ground due to hazards such as snags and <br />
downed trees. Taylor Burn Guard Station is in good condition and wrapped with fire-protective material. Much of the area around Blair <br />
Lake experience high severity fire with high tree mortality and trees with broken tops. The aerial view of Joe Goddard Grove shows <br />
primarily green forest with some smaller pockets where the tree canopy burned. Joe Goddard Grove and Constitution Grove were <br />
prepared with hoselays, pumps and sprinklers as a protective measure in case the fire reached those areas. Photographs of the sites <br />
that have been assessed are available on the incident Inciweb or Facebook pages. Waldo Lake Lookout survived the fire and fire crews <br />
unwrapped the building on Friday.  <br />
<br />
East Zone Operations: The Deschutes National Forest has slightly modified the fire closure that went into effect on September 9, 2022.  <br />
The new order opens access to Lava Lake from the north on Cascade Lakes Highway.  All fire equipment has been moved out of the <br />
area, and lake access is available through Lava Lake Resort, which will open this weekend.  Lava Lake Campground and Little Lava <br />
Lake Campground remain closed.  The Cascade Lakes Highway will remain closed between Lava Lake and the Crescent Cutoff/ Road <br />
61.  When driving in areas adjacent to the road closures make sure to watch out for slow moving commercial trucks and fire traffic. <br />
<br />
Crews have completed work on 24 miles of the 52-mile shaded fuel break on Highway 46.  Operational crews are making good <br />
progress on creating a defensible space along the scenic highway using equipment such as skidders, log trucks, masticators, chippers, <br />
and dump trucks.  Fuel break work continues to the west side of Cultus Mountain, tying together Little Cultus Lake to Cultus Lake. <br />
<br />
Weather: Warmer and drier weather is forecasted for the weather bringing temperatures in the 70s. Overnight lows will be cold with <br />
some higher elevation valleys nearing freezing.  <br />
<br />
Closures: The Deschutes National Forest and Willamette National Forest both have closures and fire restrictions in effect. Please visit <br />
Willamette National Forest and Deschutes National Forest for the most recent closure orders and maps. Elijah Bristow State Park is in <br />
use by firefighters and closed to the public. A Temporary Flight Restriction (TFR) is in place. The use of drones is prohibited in the fire <br />
area, please make it safe for our firefighters to use aircraft on the fire. Pacific Crest Trail hikers should visit pcta.org for current <br />
information.</span>

Highlights: Forest Service Road 39 is open to the public, as are most other roads outside of the fire closure areas. Four roads of note <br />
that remain closed are the Upper and Lower Imnaha roads and Hat Point road and Dug Bar road. All roads and trails within the fire <br />
closure areas are closed. FOREST ORDER NO. 06-16-04-22-13 details all of the road, area and trail closures related to the Double <br />
Creek, Sturgill and Nebo fires.  <br />
<br />
Double Creek Fire: 157,704 acres | 81% contained | 575 personnel assigned  <br />
<br />
The fire grew six acres in the last twenty-four hours. The northern and southern edges of the fire are the main area of interest in that <br />
they are still producing heat and smoke. Daily reconnaissance flights are utilized to monitor both edges for increased fire activity and <br />
contingency plans are in place to deal with any flare ups. An uptick in smoke was identified yesterday in the Freezeout drainage.  <br />
<br />
Eagle Cap Wilderness Fires  <br />
<br />
The Nebo, Sturgill, and Goat Mountain 2 Fires were lightning-caused and are being managed to protect public and private infrastructure <br />
while playing a natural role within designated Wilderness. Progress on managed fires is expressed through the accomplishment of <br />
ecological and fuel reduction objectives as opposed to progress on full suppression fires, which is expressed through containment. <br />
<br />
Nebo Fire: 12,600 acres | 50% of management objectives achieved | 11 personnel assigned <br />
<br />
There was no measurable growth of the fire in the last forty-eight hours. Fire suppression repair is the order of the day. Fire control lines <br />
are being covered with native vegetation and water bars are being installed where needed. These actions will prevent control lines from <br />
becoming erosion channels. Crews will continue to monitor for any hot spots and mop them up when discovered. <br />
<br />
Sturgill Fire: 20,192 acres | 53% of management objectives achieved | 47 personnel assigned <br />
<br />
There was no measurable growth of the fire in the last forty-eight hours. Log trucks continue hauling trees to staging areas where they <br />
will be sold and then processed into wood products. Excavators and masticators are chipping brush and debris along several roads <br />
outside of the wilderness. Those chips then play a vital role in recycling nutrients back into the soil. Pumps, hoses, and other equipment <br />
are being transported by trucks back to Joseph for rehab.  <br />
<br />
Goat Mountain 2 Fire: 536 acres | 0 personnel assigned <br />
<br />
The Goat Mountain 2 Fire exhibited zero growth in the last twenty-four hours. Aircraft will continue to monitor the fire as smoke and <br />
weather permit. <br />
<br />
Weather: Temperatures should reach the high 70s and into the 80s in the valleys and on the north end of the Double Creek fire. <br />
Relative humidity only recovered to about 40% over nigh and will drop to about 20% today. A warming trend is expected through <br />
Tuesday. <br />
<br />
Wallowa-Whitman National Forest Temporary Area Closures:  The Wallowa-Whitman National Forest issued Temporary Area Closures <br />
for the Double Creek Fire, Nebo Fire, and Sturgill and Goat Mountain 2 Fires. Closure Orders and Maps are available on the Wallowa-<br />
Whitman National Forest Fire Incident Updates page. <br />
<br />
 Road Closures: Forest Service Road (FSR) 8250 east to the junction with FSR 8250-040, FSR 3900-100, and FSR 3900-200 remain <br />
closed. All forest service roads within the new area closure boundaries are closed. Wallowa County Road 727 remains open.</span>

Overview: The Goat Rocks Fire continues to burn 1.5 miles northeastof the town of Packwood,Washington in and around the Goat <br />
Rocks Wilderness. Despite yesterday’s more active fire behavior, its edge remains about ½ mile from Upper Timberline. Firefighter and <br />
public safety are the highest priority on the Goat Rocks Fire.  Fire managers continue to make good progress toward completing <br />
firefighting objectives; 85% of indirect control lines have been completed with additional direct control line in place around the spot and <br />
slop fires in the Coal Creek drainage near the 4610 Road.    <br />
<br />
Firefighting Activity: Yesterday, crews on the fire’s western edge focused on containing the fire that had “slopped” (crossed) over the <br />
containment line around the previous day’s successful burn operation.  Dozers and hand-crews along with helicopter bucket drops were <br />
used to limit growth; fire managers plan to have it mopped up by the end of today’s shift. A fire spotted south across Coal Creek, and <br />
was mopped up by the end of yesterday’s shift. Forest Roads 4610 and 4612 have been “plumbed” (hose lines with water supply are in <br />
place in case they are needed to hold the fire at established control lines). On the northeastern edge near Dam Creek, fire continued to <br />
burn through heavy fuels in that area’s challenging terrain and helicopters worked to suppress that portion of the fire with on-going <br />
bucket drops. Mastication and chipping along Forest Road 46 continues, further strengthening it as a control line. A small crew patrolled <br />
the Timberline and Goat Rocks communities. Though firefighters have finished work in those neighborhoods, they are leaving <br />
equipment in place. Fire managers ask the public to leave the equipment where it is; crews will remove it when appropriate.  <br />
<br />
Today, firefighters will watch for hot spots around Coal Creek and scout for another spur that could be treated to serve as another <br />
control line near the 4610 and 4612 Roads. Patrols in the neighborhoods will be on-going for the next few days. Along Forest Road 46 <br />
in the north, crews will continue mitigating hazard trees and conducting mechanized woody debris removal. Fire managers will monitor <br />
the fire in the Dam Creek area. Northwest Incident Management Team (IMT) 10 will welcome Nevada IMT 4 as members of that Type 3 <br />
IMT begin arriving today. To ensure an orderly and safe transition, the incoming team will shadow the current team for over a day before <br />
taking command of the Goat Rocks Fire on Sunday evening.  <br />
<br />
Weather: Lower temperatures and higher humidity with light westerly winds are expected today through Saturday. Only a trace of <br />
precipitation is possible. On Sunday, the pattern changes to offshore bringing a shift to easterly winds and warmer temperatures.  <br />
<br />

<br />
Evacuations: Areas northeast of Butter Creek and north of US-12, including Lower Timberline and Goat Rocks, are still at an Evacuation <br />
Level 1 (Be Ready). Upper Timberline remains at an Evacuation Level 2 (Be Set). <br />
<br />

Plain, WA – Lightning started the White River and Irving Peak Fires on August 11th. The Minnow Ridge Fire cause is undetermined. <br />
These fires are burning on the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest.<br />
<br />
Suppression Strategy – Due to rugged and steep terrain, fire managers continue to implement a long-term strategy to manage these <br />
fires, including the use of primary and contingency perimeter lines for containment. Tactics include completion and reinforcement of fire <br />
lines utilizing forest roads and constructed hand line.<br />
<br />
Current Situation – A local Type 3 Incident Management Team assumed command of the fires on September 7th and is currently <br />
managing the White River, Irving Peak, Meander, and now Minnow Ridge fires. The Meander Fire remains at 6 acres with very minimal <br />
fire activity. Smoke may be visible over the next several weeks as interior fuels continue to smolder and burn out, and multiple fires burn <br />
region-wide. Updates will be posted weekly unless significant new activity occurs.<br />
<br />
White River Fire – Acres: 3,184 (as of 9/13/2022); 5% contained; Location: Sears Creek area of the White River drainage, <br />
approximately 14 miles NW of Plain, WA.<br />
The fire area remains drier and more active along the southern edges. The fire footprint remains within the control lines, and geographic <br />
features being utilized as containment lines. Firefighters are working to establish an anchor point and maintain the structure protection <br />
along Sears Creek Road and Windmill Lane.<br />
<br />
Irving Peak Fire – Acres: 3,226 (as of 9/9/2022); 5% contained; Location: Approximately 16 miles NW of Plain, WA<br />
The Irving Peak Fire received some precipitation yesterday with minimal growth and fire activity. Firefighters continue to improve roads <br />
used as containment lines and monitor fire activity.<br />
<br />
Minnow Ridge Fire – Acres: 502 (as of 9/13/2022); 0% contained; Location: Chikamin Ridge, approximately 14 miles N of Plain, WA.<br />
Fire activity has been moderate and mainly consuming ground fuels. Firefighters continue scouting forest roads and fire lines previously <br />
utilized during past wildfire activity to determine if they may benefit the current fire suppression strategy.  <br />
<br />
Weather – A chance of showers exists over the fire area today, Wednesday, September 14th, with west winds around 6-8 mph. Cooler <br />
temperatures and higher relative humidity continue into later this week.<br />
<br />
Air Quality and Smoke – Current information about air quality and health recommendations during smoky conditions is available on the <br />
Washington Smoke Blog https://wasmoke.blogspot.com/<br />
<br />
Closures – An emergency closure issued by the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest remains in place and can be viewed here: <br />
www.fs.usda.gov/alerts/okawen/alerts-notices. The PCT remains open and is not directly impacted by these fires. Several trails in the <br />
Chikamin Ridge area are pending closure due to the Minnow Ridge Fire. Fire managers are asking people to please respect these <br />
closures while recreating in the area.<br />
<br />
Restrictions – Campfires are not allowed anywhere within the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest. Stage 2 Restrictions are now in <br />
effect for the entire forest, including campgrounds and wilderness areas: www.fs.usda.gov/detail/okawen/alerts-notices/?<br />
cid=fsbdev3_053600.<br />
<br />
Evacuations – Current Chelan County evacuation levels include a Level 2 evacuation (Be Prepared) for Sears Creek Road and Level 1 <br />
(Stay Alert) for White River Road and Little Wenatchee Road. www.co.chelan.wa.us/emergency-management/pages/active-<br />

						    <span class="textarea">White River and Irving Peak Fire Update<br />
September 14, 2022<br />
<br />
Plain, WA – Lightning started the White River and Irving Peak Fires on August 11th. The Minnow Ridge Fire cause is undetermined. <br />
These fires are burning on the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest.<br />
<br />
Suppression Strategy – Due to rugged and steep terrain, fire managers continue to implement a long-term strategy to manage these <br />
fires, including the use of primary and contingency perimeter lines for containment. Tactics include completion and reinforcement of fire <br />
lines utilizing forest roads and constructed hand line.<br />
<br />
Current Situation – A local Type 3 Incident Management Team assumed command of the fires on September 7th and is currently <br />
managing the White River, Irving Peak, Meander, and now Minnow Ridge fires. The Meander Fire remains at 6 acres with very minimal <br />
fire activity. Smoke may be visible over the next several weeks as interior fuels continue to smolder and burn out, and multiple fires burn <br />
region-wide. Updates will be posted weekly unless significant new activity occurs.<br />
<br />
White River Fire – Acres: 3,184 (as of 9/13/2022); 5% contained; Location: Sears Creek area of the White River drainage, <br />
approximately 14 miles NW of Plain, WA.<br />
The fire area remains drier and more active along the southern edges. The fire footprint remains within the control lines, and geographic <br />
features being utilized as containment lines. Firefighters are working to establish an anchor point and maintain the structure protection <br />
along Sears Creek Road and Windmill Lane.<br />
<br />
Irving Peak Fire – Acres: 3,226 (as of 9/9/2022); 5% contained; Location: Approximately 16 miles NW of Plain, WA<br />
The Irving Peak Fire received some precipitation yesterday with minimal growth and fire activity. Firefighters continue to improve roads <br />
used as containment lines and monitor fire activity.<br />
<br />
Minnow Ridge Fire – Acres: 502 (as of 9/13/2022); 0% contained; Location: Chikamin Ridge, approximately 14 miles N of Plain, WA.<br />
Fire activity has been moderate and mainly consuming ground fuels. Firefighters continue scouting forest roads and fire lines previously <br />
utilized during past wildfire activity to determine if they may benefit the current fire suppression strategy.  <br />
<br />
Weather – A chance of showers exists over the fire area today, Wednesday, September 14th, with west winds around 6-8 mph. Cooler <br />
temperatures and higher relative humidity continue into later this week.<br />
