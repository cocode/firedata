<br />
John Day, OR – Fire operations on the Black Butte Fire went well yesterday.  East of the North Fork Malheur <br />
River and south towards Black Butte, crews patrolled and mopped up, strengthening the containment line.  Air <br />
resources assisted with water drops on hotspots within the fire perimeter.  The night shift continued the day <br />
shift’s work and did not need to use burning operations.  Today, smoke columns may be visible due to interior <br />
pockets of fuel igniting.<br />
 <br />
<br />
Temperatures are predicted to reach the low 70s today.  Winds should ease to 10-15 mph with gusts up to 25 <br />
mph in the afternoon.  There is also a slight chance of showers and thunderstorms in the afternoon.  There is <br />
still extreme fire danger given the long term persistent drought conditions.<br />
<br />
The west side of the fire will experience the most active fire behavior today.  The fire has the potential to spot <br />
up to ½ mile with the wind.  Areas may flare up with afternoon gusts combined with the extreme fuel dryness <br />
and low relative humidity.  For today’s operations, firefighters will be going direct, fighting active fire within 100 <br />
feet of the fire’s edge, stabilizing the lines, and monitoring the eastern side.<br />
<br />
Closures:<br />
<br />
Recreation Sites within the closure boundary: North Fork Malheur River Trailheads both north and south, <br />
North Fork Malheur Campground, Crane Crossing Trailheads both east and west, Short Creek Guard Station, <br />
Elk Creek Campground, Sunshine Flat Trailhead and Trail, Horseshoe Trailhead and Trail, Sheep Creek Trail <br />
and Trailhead, Little Crane Campground.<br />
<br />
Currently the Trout Farm and Crescent Campgrounds are still open to the public.<br />
<br />

<br />
Overview: Infra-red (IR) sensing technology mapping has shown that the Janus/Ridge and Kola Fires have <br />
merged. Moving forward we will be updating as one fire, the Bull Complex. Lower humidity, and wind gusts up <br />
to 15 mph across the ridge tops increased fire activity. A Type 2 initial attack helicopter, assigned from the <br />
Willamette National Forest, dropped water along the southern border to keep fire away from the cities of <br />
Detroit and Breitenbush, while monitoring for any areas of concern. <br />
<br />
Current Situation: Fire activity continued to be primarily in the north and northwest side of the fire. The fire <br />
entered the area of the 2010 Bull of the Woods Fire. High numbers of large dead trees and grassy fuels in the <br />
burn scar increased fire activity and created dangerous hazards for firefighters.   <br />
<br />
Afternoon winds out of the west and southwest shifted the fire to the northeast. A spot fire crossed the <br />
containment line outside of the wilderness along Forest Road 6370. Firefighters quickly established a <br />
containment line around the spot fire. Crews will be monitoring this spot while assessing the area for any <br />
additional spot fires.   <br />
<br />
Crews arranged hose lays along Forest Road 850 where Forest Road 6370 and Forest Road 4696 come <br />
together. This is to ensure water is available along containment lines to quickly extinguish any spot fires.   <br />
Weather: Cloud cover is expected in the morning with high temps in the mid-70s. West-northwest winds are to <br />
increase in the afternoon, with gusts up to 15 mph.   Smoke will continue to remain over the fire area and will <br />
be visible throughout the area. Affected communities should remain aware of smoke advisories and <br />
conditions. More information can be found at - www.airnow.gov or the Oregon Smoke Blog - <br />
https://oregonsmoke.blogspot.com/?m=1   Road Closures: Oregon Highway 224 is currently closed east of <br />
Promontory Park.    <br />
<br />
Area Closures:  Closure orders on National Forest System lands, roads, and trails within the Clackamas River <br />
Ranger District, Mt. Hood National Forest ORDER NO. 06-06-05-21-07. <br />
<br />
Forest closures are still in effect from the 2020 Beachie Creek and Lionshead Fires within the Willamette <br />
National Forest ORDER NO. 06-18-00-21-09.   Restrictions: Building, maintaining, attending, or using fire, <br />
campfire, or cooking fire, is prohibited throughout the Willamette National Forest ORDER NO. 06-18-00-21-16 <br />
and the Mt. Hood National Forest ORDER NO. 06-06-00-21-04.</span>

<br />
Bulldog Mountain Fire:  Yesterday low pressure moved into the region and assisted firefighters on the ground <br />
with wetting rain in the afternoon.  Crews conducted direct fire attack on the NE portion of the fire including <br />
some burnout operations to help tie in direct fire line to established containment lines. <br />
<br />
Forest Service Road 6110 continues to hold the fire from spreading to the east.  Heavy equipment crews <br />
continued contingency fire line construction into Deadman Creek.<br />
<br />
Today firefighters will continue with small burnouts to help strengthen fire lines where the fire is approaching.  <br />
Heavy equipment will work east of the fire to strengthen established contingency lines.  Scouting continues to <br />
the west to determine places where additional indirect fire line construction may occur.  Aircraft will be <br />
requested to assist if needed.<br />
<br />
The Bulldog Mountain Fire started August 5. 2021, located 20 miles north of Kettle Falls. The lightning caused <br />
fire spread quickly due to low relative humidity and unseasonably dry conditions.  The fire is burning in heavy <br />
timber and slash.  The fire is currently estimated at 4625 acres with 5% containment. <br />
<br />
Mack Mountain Fire:  The Mack Mountain Fire started August 5, 2021 and is just south west of the Bulldog <br />
Mountain Fire.  The fire is estimated at approximately 1200 acres.  Residents in the Deadman Creek area will <br />
see increased firefighting traffic as crews move more heavy equipment into the area.  The fire area is located <br />
in steep, rugged terrain with limited access.  Firefighters will work west on Deadman Creek Road to <br />
strengthen the road as an indirect fire line.  Scouting work is underway to establish indirect fire line to the east <br />
of the fire.<br />
<br />
Citizens should remain vigilant and are strongly encouraged to sign up for alerts at Ferry County Alerts.  <br />
Motorists traveling on the Boulder Hwy and SR395 should watch for heavy equipment and firefighters turning <br />
off and onto the roadway.  There are 180 personnel assigned to the incident. There have been two minor <br />
injuries with no structures lost.  Firefighter and public safety is our number one priority.  <br />
<br />
Level 1 evacuation orders and road closures are in place. For current evacuation orders please see Ferry <br />
County Sheriff’s Office Facebook page.  Boulder Creek Hwy and State Route 395 remain open.  For <br />
information on area & road closures on the Colville National Forest please see <br />
https://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fseprd938379.pdf   Citizens are asked to stay clear of <br />
the fire area and adhere to road and area closures. <br />
<br />
Northeast Washington IMT 2 assumed command of the fire August 7th.  Fire information and the incident <br />
command post is located at Kettle Falls High School in Kettle Falls, WA. Fire information contact is Jeff <br />

Winthrop, WA —The Cedar Creek, Cub Creek 2 and Delancy Fires are burning on the Okanogan-Wenatchee <br />
National Forest and public and private lands within Okanogan County.<br />
<br />
Fire Information Line: 509-557-0740 (8:00 am to 8:00 pm daily)<br />
<br />
Cedar Creek Fire: The fire is currently 54,261 acres and 50% contained. Forward spread has been halted on <br />
the north flank as well as on the southeast side. Two areas of heat have been a particular focus; the first on <br />
the north end of the fire is slowly burning out. The second, in Wolf Creek may require further intervention. <br />
Firefighters are assessing options to address the area. Indirect contingency line construction will continue <br />
along the Twisp River. Today firefighters will continue mopping up direct line from Thompson Ridge to Road <br />
4415 and Helispot 15.<br />
<br />
Cub Creek 2 Fire: The Cub Creek Fire is 69,678 acres and 65% contained. Fire activity on the west side of <br />
the fire was concentrated in between Honeymoon and Ruffed Grouse campground where spot fires have <br />
been burning for several days. Crews will be focused on containing that activity. Smoke was visible from logs <br />
were burning east of Ramsey Peak along the southeast fire edge. Much of the eastern perimeter remains <br />
quiet. Today, firefighters will be working to line spots near Honeymoon Campground, backhauling equipment <br />
from the area of contained firelines,  falling hazard trees and  mopping up heat within the fire perimeter.<br />
<br />
Delancy Fire:  The Delancy Fire remains at 223 acres and 95% containment.<br />
<br />
Fire Weather: Temperatures will be 7 to 10 degrees warmer, reaching upper 70s in the lower valleys and 60s <br />
up on the higher terrain. Expect generally light northwest wind during the day and some evening gusts up to <br />
15 mph in the evening. Other than a few clouds, it will be another sunny, dry, and warm summer day.  <br />
<br />
Evacuations: The community of Mazama (west) has been reduced to a Level 1 evacuation status.<br />

New Closure Order Implemented: The Buckhorn Closure Order was implemented yesterday for public safety.  <br />
The closure is located east of Chesaw in the Buckhorn Mt. area.    <br />
<br />
Walker Creek Fire:  Firefighters had a good day yesterday, despite gusty north-northwest winds to achieve <br />
three percent containment.  Assisting firefighters were air tankers and heavy helicopters. The fire size remains <br />
the same because no infrared mapping flight was conducted last evening. Weather conditions for firefighting <br />
will be favorable today with light winds and cooler temperatures.    <br />
<br />
Today’s activities include fireline construction from the southwest perimeter down to Highway 20, hot spotting <br />
west of Lost Lake, constructing indirect line with heavy equipment on the northwest perimeter, connecting the <br />
northeast perimeter of the fire into a rock quarry on the Toroda road and extinguishing smokes on the <br />
Summer and Bonaparte roads. Structure protection continues in all locations of the fire area.    <br />
<br />
Chickadee Creek Fire:  Fire acreage remains the same from yesterday because an infrared mapping flight <br />
was not performed last evening. Today’s activities include fireline preparation on the perimeter of the fire using <br />
existing roads, trails and natural features and scouting for secondary fireline locations. <br />
<br />
Evacuations: Evacuations remain in place. Refer to the Okanogan County, WA county wide advisory map for <br />
updated changes.<br />
<br />

<br />
General Updates:   Fire activity on Tuesday was moderate, due to light morning precipitation, decreased <br />
temperatures, and lingering humidity.  Clearing skies in the afternoon allowed firefighters to assess Monday’s <br />
fire growth on the Smith and Big Hamlin Fires as well as identify areas of additional spotting.  Control lines are <br />
generally holding well on the north and western portions of these fires.  Fire officials are scouting <br />
opportunities for additional locations to catch and suppress the fires in advance of the fire perimeters to the <br />
east and southeast, as well as directly creating line around spots and the fire perimeter where possible.  On <br />
Tuesday, transition of management of the Devil’s Knob Complex was transferred to Great Basin Incident <br />
Management Team 2. <br />
<br />
The following is a summary of the significant fire activity over the fire complex starting from north to south: <br />
Smith Fire – 2,805 acres – Following yesterday's west wind push on the fire, much of the fire is still holding on <br />
Dumont Creek Road on the north and is now down to the South Umpqua River and spotted across to the east <br />
side of the river.  Heavy equipment was mobilized to work on the spot which is approximately 100 acres.  Fire <br />
crews are assessing and scouting opportunities for containment to the east and south of the fire. <br />
Mule Creek Fire – 1,024 acres – all containment lines held the fire in its current footprint; mop up operations <br />
continue.<br />
 Big Hamlin Fire – 9,383 acres – Yesterday, the fire crossed indirect containment lines on the south and <br />
southeast flanks towards the Roque-Umpqua Divide. The fire is staying within the indirect containment line to <br />
the east.  The west flank is holding and good progress was made on mop up operations. Firefighters continue <br />
to work on spots created from Monday’s growth as well as identify additional locations for containment. Little <br />
Applegate Fire – 135 acres –contained and in patrol status.  <br />
Wild Cat Fire – 215 acres – fire behavior was minimal, mop up operations continue. An unstaffed sprinkler <br />
system along the east flank of the fire continues to be effective and will continue to be operated in areas too <br />
hazardous for firefighters. <br />
Section 30 (Railroad) Fire – 76 acres – contained and in patrol status; no smokes.<br />
 Dismal Creek (444) Fire – 40 acres – contained and in patrol status; no smokes. The firefighting resources <br />
on the Devil's Knob Complex are also responsible for conducting initial attack operations on the entire Tiller <br />
Ranger District and private land holdings. Firefighters are prepared to respond to any initial fire starts.</span>

<br />
Announcement:  The Southwest Area Incident Management Team 5 assumed command of the Ford <br />
Corkscrew Fire as of 6am, August 18, 2021. The team looks forward to building on the success of Northeast <br />
Washington Interagency Incident Management Team 1, as well as continuing to work closely with local <br />
partners. Evacuation orders remain in effect. Residents are encouraged to sign up for alerts from the Stevens <br />
County Sherriff’s Office via Hyper-Reach and follow the Northeast Washington Fire Information Facebook <br />
page (links available in “More Information” section, below).<br />
Overview: Yesterday, crews on the Ford Corkscrew Fire successfully constructed bulldozer line in several <br />
Divisions across the fire area. Today, crews will continue to monitor fire behavior and utilize direct firefighting <br />
tactics when and where possible. As additional resources continue to arrive at the fire, ground-based and <br />
aerial operations, including hand crews, engines, heavy equipment, helicopters, and airtankers will continue <br />
to support firefighting operations. Residents and visitors should expect an increase in fire traffic around the <br />
Lakeside Middle School in Nine Mile Falls. <br />
Fire Update: The Ford Corkscrew Fire has experienced extreme fire behavior since its start, including intense <br />
spotting and high rates of spread.  Fire behavior is expected to moderate slightly over the next few days, as <br />
the region experiences an increase in relative humidity and lighter winds. Critically low live fuel moistures will <br />
still support active fire behavior including individual and group tree torching and increased spread in areas <br />
with mixed conifer and heavier pine stands. Today and throughout the night, firefighters will continue utilizing <br />
direct tactics where possible, continue to secure the fire line, and monitor fire behavior across Ford Corkscrew <br />
Fire.<br />
Weather: Today will be partly cloudy with some patchy smoke and haze visible and temperatures in the mid-<br />
70s. The area will experience higher relative humidity and light winds.<br />
Closures/Restrictions: The following roads are closed: Highway 231 at Ford and Hidden Road (1 mile south of <br />
Springdale); Rail Canyon Road; McAlister Road and Scott’s Valley Road (at intersection with Burrows). <br />
Additionally, a temporary flight restriction (TFR) is in effect around the fire area.<br />
Ways you can help: We greatly appreciate the support and generosity of the community! Our team’s focus is <br />
on the mission of fire suppression while keeping firefighter and public safety our number one priority. Our <br />
wildland fire crews and staff at Incident Command are well equipped and cared for. While we will not be <br />
accepting donations, residents are encouraged to support firefighter efforts and the local community in other <br />
ways such posting thank you or consider financial contributions to a voluntary organization of your choice <br />
(i.e., American Red Cross, local fire department, etc.).<br />

<br />
Lakeview, OR – Overnight temperatures dropped down to 36 degrees as fire crews worked hard to plumb and <br />
strengthen lines around the Patton Meadow Fire. With dry and windy conditions gusting up to 32mph, some <br />
fire crossed the fire line on the northwest corner of the fire at Patton Meadow, but quick response by crews <br />
kept the fire from spreading any further.<br />
<br />
Operations Section Chief John Pellissier was upbeat at this morning’s briefing, saying “everyone’s happy with <br />
where we’re at right now and that lines are very secure.” Crews are preparing for burnout operations to further <br />
secure the fire line on the north side.<br />
<br />
On the south side of the fire, crews continue mop-up operations from the current 50 feet up to 100 or 150 feet <br />
into the perimeter to keep the fire from crossing containment lines. “Lines are in and water is flowing,” added <br />
Pellissier, in regard to perimeter lines along Highway 140 on the fire’s south side.<br />
Most of the remaining heat on the fire is along the north perimeter, burning in steep, rugged terrain towards <br />
Cottonwood Road. Dozers working along Cottonwood Road have completed a contingency line and crews <br />
are now working to develop a perimeter closer to the fire’s north front.<br />
<br />
OSFM will be sending two task forces home today since the risk to structures has reduced. There are still 8 <br />
structural task forces available for structure assessment, building defensible space, and assisting wildland <br />
crews where needed. As of this morning, 88 structures have been assessed.<br />
<br />
The overnight infrared flight showed Patton Meadow at 6,538 and Willow Valley at 824 acres. The fires are 30 <br />
percent and 65 percent contained respectively.<br />

The team will again provide a personal update during a Facebook Live informational meeting tonight at 7pm. <br />

<br />
Cooler, Wetter Weather Expected to Calm Fire Behavior<br />
<br />
Current Situation: Green Ridge Fire: Yesterday, containment on the Green Ride increased to 26%. The <br />
additional containment line was added along the Rattle Snake Fire burn scar in Division K on the north end of <br />
the fire and to the west on the 22 (4022) Road in Division M. The fire is currently 38,410 acres. The fire’s <br />
growth yesterday was primarily on the south side of the fire in Division S. The fire continued to burn to the <br />
south along the drainages in Branch II, burning in unburned pockets of fuel. Yesterday, the fire remained <br />
within the existing fire perimeter on the west and north sides of the fire in divisions K and M, as the <br />
established fire lines held in Branch I.<br />
<br />
With cooler weather and a chance of precipitation today, fire behavior is expected to calm across the fire area. <br />
Firefighters will continue to hold and improve completed containment lines in Division K and Division M, while <br />
improving the lines on the remaining uncontained fire line in this area. With firefighting resources continuing to <br />
transition from the north in Branch I to south in Branch II, heavy equipment will continue to be on the roads <br />
today. Crews will continue improving the Hansen Ridge Road on Forest Service, state, and county property to <br />
create a contingency line to prevent the fire from moving east. The fire is expected to continue slowly moving <br />
to the southeast with the expected northwest winds today.<br />
<br />
Current Situation: Lick Creek Fire: The Lick Creek fire remains 80,421 acres and 97% contained. Fire will <br />
continue to smolder as interior fuels continue burning over the next few days. The fire is not expected to grow <br />
outside of its existing footprint. Firefighters will continue to mop up along the fire’s perimeter and monitor <br />
containment lines and continue to support the Green Ridge fire with resources as requested and available.<br />
<br />
Rocky Mountain Team Black will be hosting a community informational update on the Green Ridge and Lick <br />
Creek fires today at 6:30 p.m. at the Laundry/Shower House (across from the Wenaha Bar & Grill) in Troy, <br />
OR. Operations staff will give the community a brief update on the fire followed by an opportunity for the <br />
community to meet with incident managers and agency officials as well as ask questions about the fires. This <br />
event will not be livestreamed due to constraints on bandwidth at the meeting site.<br />
<br />
Weather & Smoke Information: Today is expected to be cloudy and cool. There is a 70% chance of rain over <br />
the fire area. Northwest winds are expected to be 5-10 mph, with gusts to 17 mph. Temperatures will be 57-63 <br />
degrees along the ridges and 67-75 degrees in the valley bottoms. Smoke information is available on <br />
Washington Smoke Blog at: https://wasmoke.blogspot.com/<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Forest Closures: Closures are in place on the Umatilla National Forest. The forest closure for some areas on <br />
the Umatilla NF have been amended. The amended order reopened most Umatilla NF lands in Oregon. The <br />
order also closed all lands on the Walla Walla Ranger District in Washington; forest lands in Washington on <br />
the Pomeroy Ranger District remain closed to entry. The closure order is available at <br />
https://go.usa.gov/xFyhn.<br />
<br />
Evacuations: Garfield County currently has Level 1, 2 and 3 evacuations in place. Columbia County currently <br />
has Level 3, Level 2, and Level 1 evacuations in place. The Grouse Flats area is currently under a Level 1 <br />
evacuation in Garfield County, Asotin County, and Wallowa County, Oregon. An interactive fire map that <br />
shows evacuations and other important information is available at https://tinyurl.com/yv2sypd4.</span>

Fire Update for Wednesday, August 18, 2021<br />
<br />
Overall Objective The Rough Patch Complex and Jack Fire are being managed under a full suppression <br />
strategy using containment and confinement tactics to minimize fire spread to prevent loss of valuable <br />
resource.  Leaders’ intent is to not allow the fire to progress to the west by using the PACE model – Primary, <br />
Alternate, Contingency and Emergency control Lines and to keep the fires as small as possible while working <br />
toward full containment.<br />
<br />
Closures The Umpqua and Willamette National Forests have updated existing closure orders to encompass <br />
the Rough Patch, Jack, Archie Creek and Devil's Knob Fire Areas. This includes Canton Creek Campground, <br />
Musick Guard Station and Cover Campground. <br />
<br />
Roseburg District Bureau of Land Management has expanded its closure area to include the Scaredman <br />
Recreation Site. Francis Creek Road from the junction with Canton Creek Road north to the district boundary <br />
has been and remains closed since August 5. <br />
<br />
Highway 138 between Roseburg and Diamond Lake and Crater Lake remains open.  Slow down and be alert <br />
while passing through the fire area.  <br />
<br />
Chaos and Little Bend Fires:  The primary containment lines of these fires lay on the west and northwest <br />
flanks.  Direct fire line construction and indirect fire lines with burnout operations are occurring in these areas <br />
of the fire. On the west and south flanks of these fire the primary containment lines are at the perimeter of the <br />
fire and heavy equipment is working to construct and reinforce alternate and contingency lines.  These two <br />
fires are at 0% containment, but progress is being made.<br />
<br />
Jack Fire:  The Jack Fire does have containment lines that are holding on the west and north flanks of the <br />
fires and these account for the 51% containment of the fire.  Fire crews are patrolling these flanks and taking <br />
action to hold the lines as necessary.  The southwest and south flanks of the fire is seeing active fire behavior  <br />
tactics on these flanks include direct dozer line, the construction of primary and alternate lines using the road <br />
system and building and reinforcing contingency lines along the 27 and 2715 roads.  The northeast part of the <br />
fire actively burn on Monday and increased the overall fire size by approximately 2,000 acres.<br />
<br />
Buckhead and Near Minky Fires:  These fires lay south of the Jack fire and have similar active fire behavior <br />
on the west flanks.  The contingency line being constructed with heavy equipment for the Jack fire will extend <br />
to the south and act as the primary holding line to prevent these fires from moving to the west.  On the south <br />
and east flanks of these fire, heavy equipment is working to build fire line to hold and prevent fire from <br />
escaping to the south and east.</span>

<br />
Fireline on the Northern Perimeter Holds Against Gusty Winds<br />
 <br />
Current Situation: Green Ridge Fire: The Green Ridge Fire is currently 37,599 acres and is 19% contained. <br />
The last 48 hours have tested fire lines in Division M, on the 22 (4022) Road, with gusty southwest winds. <br />
Those lines held and Division M remains in the same footprint as before the increased winds over the last few <br />
days, demonstrating the effectiveness of the firing operation and fire line in place on the 22 (4022) Road. <br />
Yesterday, the north side of the fire saw minimal activity in Divisions K and M, spanning from the Kendall <br />
Skyline Road to the existing containment line on the north end of the Lick Creek Fire scar. The Green Ridge <br />
Fire continued to move slightly to the south in Division W, extending just south of Oregon Butte. The majority <br />
of the fire’s growth yesterday was on the southern perimeter where unburned pockets of fuel burned between <br />
previously burned areas in Division S.<br />
<br />
The fire is expected to continue burning southward today consuming unburned pockets of fuel along the fire’s <br />
southern perimeter in divisions W and P. With the fire line successfully holding in divisions M and K through <br />
the wind event over the last 48 hours, a number of firefighting resources will be strategically transitioned to <br />
the southern perimeter of the fire. There will still be firefighters in place in divisions K and M on the northern <br />
and western fire lines in to patrol and engage any existing pockets of heat. Indirect line construction will begin <br />
in Division P today to the south of the Lick Creek Fire scar. Heavy equipment is expected on the roads today <br />
with the transition of firefighting resources from Branch I to Branch II.<br />
<br />
Current Situation: Lick Creek Fire: The Lick Creek fire remains 80,421 acres and 97% contained. The <br />
uncontained 3% of fire line is east of Misery Springs campground on West Mountain Road. Torching and <br />
smoldering within the interior of the fire perimeter is expected to continue as the fire continues to burn <br />
unburned pockets of fuel from within the fire’s perimeter. Firefighters will continue to mop up along the fire’s <br />
perimeter and monitor containment lines.<br />
<br />
Weather & Smoke Information: The cooling trend is expected to continue today, which will be accompanied by <br />
moderate northwest winds. These gusty winds are expected to help with smoke dispersion across the area. <br />
West-southwest winds are expected to be 7-14 mph, with gusts to 20 mph. Temperatures will be 60-65 <br />
degrees along the ridges and 68-73 degrees in the valley bottoms. Smoke information is available on <br />
Washington Smoke Blog at: https://wasmoke.blogspot.com/<br />
<br />
Forest Closures: Closures are in place on the Umatilla National Forest. The forest closure for some areas on <br />
the Umatilla NF have been amended. The amended order reopened most Umatilla NF lands in Oregon. The <br />
order also closed all lands on the Walla Walla Ranger District in Washington; forest lands in the Pomeroy <br />
Ranger District remain closed to entry. the closure order is available at https://go.usa.gov/xFyhn.<br />
<br />
Evacuations: Garfield County currently has Level 1, 2 and 3 evacuations in place. Columbia County currently <br />
has Level 3, Level 2, and Level 1 evacuations in place. The Grouse Flats area is currently under a Level 1 <br />
evacuation in Garfield County, Asotin County, and Wallowa County, Oregon. An interactive fire map that <br />
shows evacuations and other important information is available at https://tinyurl.com/yv2sypd4.<br />
<br />
Temporary Flight Restrictions: A Temporary Flight Restriction is in place over the Green Ridge Fire and Lick <br />
Creek Fire. Wildfires are a No Drone Zone. If you fly, we can’t. Whenever a drone is spotted near the fire all <br />
aircraft are grounded until we can be sure the drone is clear of the area. For more information, visit <br />

<br />
Bulldog Mountain Fire:  Yesterday low pressure moved into the region and assisted firefighters on the ground <br />
with wetting rain in the afternoon.  Crews conducted direct fire attack on the NE portion of the fire including <br />
some burnout operations to help tie in direct fire line to established containment lines. <br />
<br />
Forest Service Road 6110 continues to hold the fire from spreading to the east.  Heavy equipment crews <br />
continued contingency fire line construction into Deadman Creek.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Today firefighters will continue with small burnouts to help strengthen fire lines where the fire is approaching.  <br />
Heavy equipment will work east of the fire to strengthen established contingency lines.  Scouting continues to <br />
the west to determine places where additional indirect fire line construction may occur.  Aircraft will be <br />
requested to assist if needed.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
The Bulldog Mountain Fire started August 5. 2021, located 20 miles north of Kettle Falls. The lightning caused <br />
fire spread quickly due to low relative humidity and unseasonably dry conditions.  The fire is burning in heavy <br />
timber and slash.  The fire is currently estimated at 4625 acres with 5% containment. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Mack Mountain Fire:  The Mack Mountain Fire started August 5, 2021 and is just south west of the Bulldog <br />
Mountain Fire.  The fire is estimated at approximately 1200 acres.  Residents in the Deadman Creek area will <br />
see increased firefighting traffic as crews move more heavy equipment into the area.  The fire area is located <br />
in steep, rugged terrain with limited access.  Firefighters will work west on Deadman Creek Road to <br />
strengthen the road as an indirect fire line.  Scouting work is underway to establish indirect fire line to the east <br />
of the fire.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Citizens should remain vigilant and are strongly encouraged to sign up for alerts at Ferry County Alerts.  <br />
Motorists traveling on the Boulder Hwy and SR395 should watch for heavy equipment and firefighters turning <br />
off and onto the roadway.  There are 180 personnel assigned to the incident. There have been two minor <br />
injuries with no structures lost.  Firefighter and public safety is our number one priority.  <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Level 1 evacuation orders and road closures are in place. For current evacuation orders please see Ferry <br />
County Sheriff’s Office Facebook page.  Boulder Creek Hwy and State Route 395 remain open.  For <br />
information on area & road closures on the Colville National Forest please see <br />
https://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fseprd938379.pdf   Citizens are asked to stay clear of <br />
the fire area and adhere to road and area closures. <br />
<br />
 <br />

Kwis Fire: Kwis fire held within its existing footprint again yesterday. Mop up and patrol are ongoing.  <br />
Unburned islands of trees and other vegetation in the interior areas will continue to burn for many days. <br />
Helicopters dropped bucket loads of water to check any spread from the interior burning, and firefighters are <br />
going in today to look for further opportunities to secure the fire perimeter.  Last night, a flare up was visible <br />
for about an hour as one of those interior islands burned.  Hazardous trees along roadways are being <br />
identified and felled.  The fire area is still very dangerous with many hazards and people not associated with <br />
the firefighting efforts are asked to heed the closed road signs and the Forest Closure Order.  <br />
Gales and Ninemile Fires: The Gales and Ninemile Fires are about seven miles south of Highway 126 and 11 <br />
miles north of Westfir, Oregon.  The fires are burning in steep terrain. Based on a combination of data <br />
modeling, mapping, and field observations, firefighters are determining the best placement of limited available <br />
resources.  They are scouting and constructing containment lines in areas with the greatest chance of <br />
success for protecting communities and providing for public and firefighter safety. <br />
Firelines are being further strengthened as crews add depth by burning out along the edge to consume <br />
vegetation that may otherwise compromise containment as the active fire approaches. Yesterday, firefighters <br />
conducted burnout operations, easing fire along Forest Road 1825 down to Road 1824 and securing a critical <br />
piece of containment line to prevent spread of the fire to the west. In the Fall Creek drainage, Wildland Fire <br />
Modules are working in conjunction with heavy equipment and aviation assets to prepare fire line west of <br />
Forest Road 1832 and its intersection with Forest Road 18. On the east side of the fire, crews are scouting <br />
and constructing line toward Forest Road 1912.<br />
Weather & Smoke: Last night’s humidity rose to 90% and is forecasted to be 35-40% today with day time high <br />
temperatures in the low 70’s.  Clearer skies today will facilitate aviation support to firefighters and can <br />
increase fire activity especially in the afternoons.  Winds will be primarily from the west and northwest.  <br />
Evacuations: Level 1 and 3 evacuation notices have been issued by Lane County.  For current evacuation <br />
information and an interactive map of evacuation areas, visit: www.lanecounty.org. <br />
Closures: Some National Forest System lands near the Middle Fork Complex are temporarily closed to <br />
provide for public safety. For more information, visit www.fs.usda.gov/willamette.</span>

<br />
Current Situation: Strong winds from the north with gusts up to 35 mph impacted the fire area yesterday. <br />
Firefighters, with the help of aviation assets, were able to hold the fire and no significant growth occurred. Fire <br />
behavior was very active with surface fire, some short range spotting and crown fire runs backing into the <br />
wind. Dozers worked to construct line west of Mineral Hill and firefighters prepared for structure defense in the <br />
town. No homes have been destroyed but the threat to the 387 homes in the area will remain until the <br />
established lines along the fire’s edge can be controlled around and above Conconully.  <br />
Today on the southwest portion of the fire west of Mineral Hill hand crews will continue constructing line where <br />
the dozers left of yesterday. When winds become favorable a tactical firing operation will tie the constructed <br />
line into the main body of the fire. This operation is intended to address southern spread. Firefighters will be <br />
scouting for areas to build primary and contingency indirect lines to address north-eastern spread. Due to the <br />
heavy dead and downed fuel loading there is a high potential for the fire to spot to the east if weather <br />
conditions are aligned. Residents in areas nearby or east of the fire are encouraged to sign up for emergency <br />
alerts through Okanogan County Emergency Management.<br />
<br />
Weather: Temperatures 7-10 degrees warmer with light northwest wind and low humidity<br />
Closures and Restrictions:<br />
Closure Order: 06-21-09-21-10 Southern Cub Creek 2 issued by the Colville National Forest has closed <br />
numerous areas, trails, and roads in and around the fire area<br />
FS Road 3700100 is closed at the junction with FS Road 4200000 west of Conconully<br />
FS Road 3800015 is closed at the forest boundary north of Conconully<br />
Mineral Hill Road is closed just west of Conconully<br />
Evacuations:<br />
Level Three: Salmon Meadows-Kerr, Mineral Hill, West Fork-Conconully, and the area immediately <br />
surrounding the town limits of Concunully<br />
Level One: The area within the town limits of Conconully</span>

Fire Update for Wednesday, August 18, 2021<br />
<br />
Overall Objective The Rough Patch Complex and Jack Fire are being managed under a full suppression <br />
strategy using containment and confinement tactics to minimize fire spread to prevent loss of valuable <br />
resource.  Leaders’ intent is to not allow the fire to progress to the west by using the PACE model – Primary, <br />
Alternate, Contingency and Emergency control Lines and to keep the fires as small as possible while working <br />
toward full containment.<br />
<br />
Closures The Umpqua and Willamette National Forests have updated existing closure orders to encompass <br />
the Rough Patch, Jack, Archie Creek and Devil's Knob Fire Areas. This includes Canton Creek Campground, <br />
Musick Guard Station and Cover Campground. <br />
<br />
Roseburg District Bureau of Land Management has expanded its closure area to include the Scaredman <br />
Recreation Site. Francis Creek Road from the junction with Canton Creek Road north to the district boundary <br />
has been and remains closed since August 5. <br />
<br />
Highway 138 between Roseburg and Diamond Lake and Crater Lake remains open.  Slow down and be alert <br />
while passing through the fire area.  <br />
<br />
Chaos and Little Bend Fires:  The primary containment lines of these fires lay on the west and northwest <br />
flanks.  Direct fire line construction and indirect fire lines with burnout operations are occurring in these areas <br />
of the fire. On the west and south flanks of these fire the primary containment lines are at the perimeter of the <br />
fire and heavy equipment is working to construct and reinforce alternate and contingency lines.  These two <br />
fires are at 0% containment, but progress is being made.<br />
<br />
Jack Fire:  The Jack Fire does have containment lines that are holding on the west and north flanks of the <br />
fires and these account for the 51% containment of the fire.  Fire crews are patrolling these flanks and taking <br />
action to hold the lines as necessary.  The southwest and south flanks of the fire is seeing active fire behavior  <br />
tactics on these flanks include direct dozer line, the construction of primary and alternate lines using the road <br />
system and building and reinforcing contingency lines along the 27 and 2715 roads.  The northeast part of the <br />
fire actively burn on Monday and increased the overall fire size by approximately 2,000 acres.<br />
<br />
Buckhead and Near Minky Fires:  These fires lay south of the Jack fire and have similar active fire behavior <br />
on the west flanks.  The contingency line being constructed with heavy equipment for the Jack fire will extend <br />
to the south and act as the primary holding line to prevent these fires from moving to the west.  On the south <br />
and east flanks of these fire, heavy equipment is working to build fire line to hold and prevent fire from <br />
escaping to the south and east.</span>

<br />
Yesterday: Strong, gusty north and west winds led to extreme fire behavior. This resulted in several areas of <br />
spotting across control lines on the northeast side of the fire, west of Hwy 410. A Level 3 evacuation order <br />
was issued at 3:30 PM for areas along Hwy 410 from Rock Creek Road to Little Naches Road. When the <br />
evacuation orders were issued, fire crews went into structure protection mode, engaging pumps and sprinkler <br />
systems to protect structures. The fire was active on all fronts with most of the activity on the north and east <br />
sides. On Bumping River Road, the fire reached the River and a small fire spotted across the river, but crews <br />
held it between the river and the road.<br />
Today: Cooler weather and higher humidity will be beneficial for fire activity today and will provide fire <br />
managers a chance to assess the fire spread from yesterday. Crews are actively working along the Highway <br />
410 corridor and Bumping River Road, and in the interior where additional fire lines are being developed or <br />
strengthened. Air assets in the form of federally-operated drones will confirm fire spread, and aircraft will fly as <br />
resources are available and weather conditions permit. The southeast corner at Rattlesnake Springs drainage <br />
is currently holding well, as are containment measures along Bumping River Road and the Goose Prairie <br />
community. Evaluation for pump systems and sprinkler systems will continue, and adjustments will be made <br />
where necessary. Resources are continuing to arrive by the hour. A Red Cross shelter has been established <br />
at Summit View Church of Christ, 100 North 72nd Avenue in Yakima.<br />
Evacuations: A LEVEL 3 evacuation order has been issued from Rock Creek Road to Little Naches Road <br />
along Hwy 410.  Bumping River Road and drainage remains at a LEVEL 3 evacuation.  This means if you live <br />
in either of these two LEVEL 3 areas, you need to GO NOW and evacuate.  Additionally, Hwy 410 from Eagle <br />
Rock north to Rock Creek Rd and from Little Naches Road west to Bumping River Road is currently in a <br />
LEVEL 2. Those living in these LEVEL 2 areas need to BE SET and prepared for potential evacuation. Check <br />
with Yakima County Office of Emergency Management for updates on evacuation information. Residents and <br />
visitors are encouraged to sign up for emergency alerts through Yakima County: yakimacounty.us/2222/Alert-<br />

Tuesday's Showers Help Firefighters Extinguish Fires<br />
<br />
CANYONVILLE, Ore. – Tuesday's light precipitation and cooler temperatures helped calm the Skyline Ridge <br />
Complex. The finer fuels that usually ignite easily were too wet to burn. Some of the moisture was able to <br />
reach pockets of heat, cooling them. Sometimes this created smoke or steam, helping firefighters find the hot <br />
spots.<br />
<br />
While the flammability of smaller fuels changes quickly with any rain or increase in humidity, larger fuels need <br />
much more moisture to make them harder to burn. Much of the what's burning on these fires is large rotting <br />
logs lying on the ground. These will continue to take a lot of work to cool, including cutting open burning <br />
sections, scraping away layers of coals, and mixing coals with water and dirt to extinguish them.<br />
<br />
Firefighters continue making good progress mopping up hot areas on the fires. They are taking advantage of <br />
the natural moisture and the cooler temperatures, On the Poole Creek Fire, crews cooled the outer edges of <br />
most of the fire, including areas burned-out last Friday night and Saturday morning. In many areas, they <br />
extinguished most of the heat within 150 feet of the control lines. Containment on the Complex has increased <br />
to 81%. Today's assignment is to continue safely deepening mop up toward the interior.<br />
<br />
The winds continue to be a threat to the firefighters. Gusty winds are toppling both dead trees known as <br />
“snags” and green trees damaged by the fire. One area on the north end of Poole Creek Fire has a large <br />
number of unstable trees, making it too hazardous for firefighters during windy periods.<br />
<br />
The Douglas County Sheriff's Office has reduced the evacuation area and level for Upper Cow Creek Road. <br />
To get the most up to date information visit https://www.dcso.com/evacuations. The Level 1 (Be Ready) <br />
evacuation order remains in place on Moore Ranch Rd. and Ferguson Lane.</span>

<br />
Inchelium, WA – The Summit Trail Fire was started by lightning on July 12, and is burning on the Colville <br />
Reservation approximately 17 miles west of Inchelium in terrain that is steep, rough and often difficult to <br />
access. <br />
Increased humidity and cooler temperatures have temporarily moderated fire behavior. Varying amounts of <br />
precipitation fell around the fire area yesterday, restoring some moisture to lighter fuels such as grasses but <br />
having minimal effect on heavier fuels such as brush and trees. The rain has also complicated firefighters’ <br />
movement around the perimeter as dirt roads became slippery with the moisture.<br />
Yesterday, firefighters built additional sections of containment line along the north and east flanks of the fire <br />
and, as of last evening, the Brush Mountain spot fire’s perimeter was nearly surrounded by line.<br />
Containment lines are secure on the fire’s southern edges and western flanks; today, firefighters in these <br />
areas will do mop-up and patrol. Crews are taking advantage of favorable weather conditions to safely build <br />
containment lines right at the fire’s edge around the north and east portions of the fire.<br />
Summit Trail Evacuations: Evacuation levels are subject to change. To verify the most current status of <br />

						    <span class="textarea">The Twentyfive Mile Fire was first reported at 3:45 p.m. on August 15, 2021. The fire was initially burning on <br />
the south shore of Lake Chelan near Twentyfive Mile Creek and has expanded south and west of the area. <br />
The fire is under joint jurisdiction of the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest, Washington Department of <br />
Natural Resources, Bureau of Land Management and Chelan County Fire District 7.<br />
A Type 3 Incident Management Team led by Incident Commander Escobar took command of the firefighting <br />
response at 6:00 a.m. August 16. Additional resources are continuing to arrive. A Type 1 Incident <br />
Management Team has been ordered and is expected to arrive Thursday.<br />
 The fire continues to burn in timber, brush and grass. The fire size is estimated at 7072 acres. Crews staffed <br />
the fire overnight and continued to reinforce structure protection lines. Today crews will work on constructing <br />
and reinforcing new containment lines. The fire may continue to move to the south and east, wind-driven in <br />
extreme heat. Limited resources and extreme instances of fire behavior continue to challenge containment.<br />
Air resources will continue attack on the fire throughout the day. Aircraft may use local bodies of water, <br />
including Lake Chelan, to fill. Recreational boaters should be aware of aircraft takeoff and landings and keep <br />
a safe distance.<br />
Evacuations: The most up-to-date evacuation information is available through Chelan County Emergency <br />
Management at the following links. Current evacuation levels remained in place overnight and will continue <br />
throughout the day. The Chelan County Sherriff will update evacuation levels as conditions warrant.<br />
Level 3 (Go Now) evacuations for all properties north of Cove Marina on South Lakeshore Road, the area of <br />
Granite Falls Road and First Creek Road west of Lakeshore. Lakeshore Road is closed from Cove Marina <br />
north past the Twentyfive Mile drainage.<br />
Level 2 (Get Set) from South from Cove Marina to Morning Sun Drive.<br />
Level 1 (Get Ready) Lakeshore Road south of Granite Falls area.<br />
Closures: A forest area closure is pending. All roads in the Level 3 area are closed to the general public <br />
including Lakeshore Road. Residents are asked to avoid travel on open areas of Lakeshore Road to make <br />
way for firefighting personnel and equipment.<br />
Weather: Today's forecast is for mostly clear skies with areas of smoke and haze developing in the afternoon. <br />
Winds light to moderate throughout the day with a high near 80. Lighter winds and lower temperatures are <br />
forecast for the evening.<br />
Smoke Information: Lower temperatures are creating clearer skies, however, smoke and haze may develop <br />
later in the afternoon. Visit https://wasmoke.blogspot.com/ for local air quality information.<br />
Fire Restrictions: Campfire restrictions are in effect. Campfires are prohibited throughout the Okanogan-<br />
Wenatchee National Forest, including developed campgrounds and congressionally designated Wilderness. <br />

<br />
Inchelium, WA – The Summit Trail Fire was started by lightning on July 12, and is burning on the Colville <br />
Reservation approximately 17 miles west of Inchelium.  The Upper Lime Creek Fire was also burning on the <br />
Colville Reservation approximately 6 miles north of Keller. The 376-acre fire is 75 percent contained. <br />
Northwest Incident Management Team 10 has been managing both the Upper Lime Creek Fire and the <br />
Summit Trail Firewith 421 personnel engaged in fighting the fires in terrain that is steep, rough and often <br />
difficult to access.<br />
<br />
Southwesterly winds from Sunday and overnight into early Monday carried embers that ignited large spot fires <br />
on Brush and Tungsten Mountains. Winds pushed the Summit Trail Fireto the northeast, east and southeast.  <br />
Using ground and air reconnaissance, fire managers were able to determine the extent of the perimeter’s <br />
growth.<br />
<br />
Due to this fire growth, Colville Tribal Police issued additional Level 2 and Level 3 evacuation notices (see <br />
below). Fire crews, heavy equipment and air support engaged in structure protection in the newly affected <br />
areas. Firefighters on the south edge and southwest flank of the fire continued to build, connect and reinforce <br />
lines while crews on the west side successfully checked a fire that had moved across the containment lines.    <br />
<br />
Weather conditions are expected to moderate as a cold front enters the region. Rainfall is a possibility, but <br />
accumulations are forecast to be slight. Cooler temperatures and increased relative humidity could result in <br />
less active fire behavior.<br />
<br />
Today, firefighters will continue structure protection, reinforce existing lines around the fire’s edges and look <br />
for favorable areas to build containment lines. Priorities include protecting homes at Barnaby Creek through <br />
containment of the fire burning on Brush Mountain, and limiting fire spread from the southeast flank toward <br />
the Twin Lakes area. This will be the last daily update to include the Upper Lime Creek Fire; responsibility for <br />
this fireis scheduled to return to Mt. Tolman Fire Center (MTFC) today. For further information about the Upper <br />
Lime Creek Fire, contact MTFC at (509) 634-3100.<br />

New Closure Order Implemented: The Buckhorn Closure Order was implemented yesterday for public safety.  <br />
The closure is located east of Chesaw in the Buckhorn Mt. area.    <br />
<br />
Walker Creek Fire:  Firefighters had a good day yesterday, despite gusty north-northwest winds to achieve <br />
three percent containment.  Assisting firefighters were air tankers and heavy helicopters. The fire size remains <br />
the same because no infrared mapping flight was conducted last evening. Weather conditions for firefighting <br />
will be favorable today with light winds and cooler temperatures.    <br />
<br />
Today’s activities include fireline construction from the southwest perimeter down to Highway 20, hot spotting <br />
west of Lost Lake, constructing indirect line with heavy equipment on the northwest perimeter, connecting the <br />
northeast perimeter of the fire into a rock quarry on the Toroda road and extinguishing smokes on the <br />
Summer and Bonaparte roads. Structure protection continues in all locations of the fire area.    <br />
<br />
Chickadee Creek Fire:  Fire acreage remains the same from yesterday because an infrared mapping flight <br />
was not performed last evening. Today’s activities include fireline preparation on the perimeter of the fire using <br />
existing roads, trails and natural features and scouting for secondary fireline locations. <br />
<br />
Evacuations: Evacuations remain in place. Refer to the Okanogan County, WA county wide advisory map for <br />
updated changes.<br />
<br />

 <br />
he Whitmore Fire is located on the Colville Reservation south of Omak Lake and west of Nespelem, WA. The <br />
Incident Command Post at Nespelem Community Center is closed to all but essential personnel to help <br />
ensure the health and safety of community members and firefighters.<br />
<br />
A low pressure system moved into the area yesterday, bringing measurable rain to some surrounding fires but <br />
only a trace amount over the Whitmore Fire. It will be warmer today, with high temperatures ranging from 73 <br />
to 82 degrees over most of the fire area. Winds will trend from the north at 10 to 12 miles per hour.<br />
<br />
SIZE:  58,280 acres<br />
CONTAINMENT: 65%<br />
PERSONNEL: 288<br />
CAUSE: Lightning<br />
RESOURCES:<br />
Hand Crews: 5<br />
Engines: 21<br />
Dozers: 1<br />
Water Tenders: 17<br />
Helicopters: 1<br />
Fixed Wing: 1<br />
<br />
Operations<br />
Blowing dust and ash became an issue yesterday with the increased winds, so water tenders moved through <br />
the fire area watering roads to improve conditions. Patrolling engines on the eastern fire perimeter located <br />
several smoking hot spots near the fireline yesterday and extinguished the heat sources by exposing the <br />
smoldering material and mixing it with water and soil. Firefighters continued their work systematically gridding <br />
the northeast fire perimeter, searching for creeping fire or stumps that were still burning near the fireline. Fire <br />
crews finished wrapping and securing the old Mount Whitmore Lookout yesterday, ensuring the historic wood <br />
structure would be protected from smoldering fuels nearby.<br />
<br />
Mop-up in the northeastern portion of the fire is ongoing today as fire crews strengthen and deepen fire <br />
containment lines. Firefighters will continue to identify and map future suppression repair needs in the Kartar <br />
Valley and around the fire. As containment increases and mop-up work winds down, excess equipment and <br />
crews are being demobilized from this incident to assist on other regional fires.<br />
<br />
Evacuations<br />
All Level 2 evacuations on the Whitmore Fire have been reduced to Level 1 evacuations. The Columbia River <br />
Road corridor, Kartar Valley, Colville Agency, the community of Nespelem, and the SR155 corridor from <br />
Colville Agency north up to the Mission are now all in a level 1 evacuation status. Call Tribal Police at (509) <br />
634-2472 with all evacuation questions.<br />
<br />
Road Closures<br />
Coyote Creek Road remains closed.</span>
