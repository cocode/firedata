Update: Fire behavior is anticipated to be light to moderate today.  Crews are extinguishing hot spots as the fire nears the highway and continue to prevent the <br />
fire from crossing the highway.  Crews are assessing areas of the fire above the road to determine what is needed to make the highway safe for public use.  Work <br />
by crews and heavy equipment continue to establish and reinforce containment lines along forest roads on the west and eastern sections of the fire.<br />
<br />
Washington State Mobilized Resources are still present and working diligently to protect homes and structures from the fire.<br />
<br />
Weather and Fire Behavior: Westerly onshore flows will continue the next couple of days with little change in surface weather conditions. Expect mostly cloudy <br />
skies, high humidity, and cooler temperatures. Precipitation is not expected today, but chances of light precipitation is possible on Friday as a disturbance begins <br />
to influence the region. Temperatures are forecast to be 54°F on the upper ridges and 73°F in the valleys, with minimum relative humidity near 62%.  Winds will <br />
be light, coming out of the west at 3-8 mph.<br />
<br />
Fuels remain dry and the fire will move primarily where wind and slopes align in steep terrain. The fire is still capable of large runs if winds increase above 25 <br />
mph. However, high winds are not currently predicted, and fine fuel moistures continue to increase with the rise in relative humidity resulting in reduce fire activity.<br />
<br />
Road Closures: State Highway 2 remains closed east of the junction of Index-Galena Road and Highway 2 to the junction of 5th St N. into the town of Skykomish. <br />
The fire continues to destabilize the steep terrain above the highway resulting in rock falls, rolling debris and falling trees. Last night a very large fire-weakened <br />
Douglas fir tree fell and slid downhill at high speed across the highway and through the guardrail. Due to these types of hazards, Highway 2 corridor remains <br />
unsafe for public use.  The Washington State Department of Transportation has been serving a critical role in clearing and restoring firefighter access.<br />
<br />
Please understand that the fire remains active and conditions could change quickly.   In order to keep the public safe, changes in evacuation levels might also be <br />
required.  Please be prepared.<br />

Summary: The Boulder Mountain Fire was detected on Wednesday August 31st, 2022, at approximately 6:00 pm. The fire is located in <br />
the Tacoma Creek and Boulder Mountain area, 9 miles Northwest of Cusick, Washington. A mix of State, Federal and Private land is <br />
impacted. The terrain is difficult, and the fire is burning in heavy timber, slash, and beetle infested trees. Cause of the fire remains under <br />
investigation.? <br />
<br />
Weather|Anticipated Fire Behavior: Wednesday saw rain over most of the fire. The weather stations showed a tenth of an inch to over a <br />
half an inch in one area on the east side. However, with the heavy canopy of trees not all rain reaches the ground, meaning the fire <br />
behavior has slowed but still has the potential to be active in the right conditions. Thunderstorms across the ridge did produce lighting <br />
strikes and observation for potential new starts is active. There remains a chance for additional moisture tomorrow as a cooling trend <br />
continues into the weekend. <br />
<br />
Actions: Despite the weather, crews did make more progress and containment is now registering at 55%. Firefighters are redistributing <br />
hose and directing water onto areas that they hadn’t been able to access earlier. As edges are marked as contained, the team will begin <br />
suppression repair efforts on many areas of the fire. Resources will shift around the fire as plans are put in place.  <br />
<br />
Important Information: What is “suppression repair?” During the course of fighting any fire, resources will disturb a lot of ground through <br />
their actions. This can be small areas like hand line or fixing a culvert to layers of contingency line put in by dozers. Suppression repair <br />
is the term for repairing all those impacts as they no longer serve their original purpose. It is important to note that repair is different <br />
than rehabilitation and does not include replanting or seeding.</span>

Current Situation: The fire remains active, mostly burning with low to moderate intensity on the perimeter where fuels and topography <br />
are conducive and in the center of the fire within a large pocket of unburned fuels. Some spotting and torching is occurring in the East <br />
Zone carried by westerly winds. Although fire behavior has calmed considerably since last weekend, fuels are still dry and fire behavior <br />
could increase under the right conditions. Smoke will continue to linger through the week, impacting air quality.  <br />
<br />
Oakridge Community Meeting: A community meeting for the communities of Oakridge and Westfir is scheduled for Saturday, September <br />
17 at 11 am at the Oakridge High School Auditorium. The meeting will also be streamed on Facebook Live. <br />
<br />
West Zone Update: Firefighters continued improving firelines to protect the communities of Oakridge and Westfir. Clear weather on the <br />
west side of the fire allowed firefighters to conduct firing operations in multiple areas around the fire perimeter. Aerial ignition occurred in <br />
the northwest along the ridges near Huckleberry Lookout and northeast of Kwis Kwis Butte to reduce fuels along the steep slopes. <br />
Burning these ridges ahead of the main fire brings the fire toward the containment lines while the weather is favorable and reduces the <br />
intensity of the main fire when it reaches the fireline. In addition, firefighters conducted burning operations to bring fire along the <br />
containment line on Forest Road 2409. All seven helicopters and the airplanes assigned to the fire were actively engaged throughout <br />
the day to support firefighter operations on the ground. During the night shift, firefighters patrolled the areas where daytime burning <br />
operations occurred. <br />
<br />
West Zone Operations: Firefighters will continue to build on the successes from the past few days. On the southern side of the fire, <br />
crews are improving the firelines near Fuji Mountain and conducting burning operations to establish an anchor point for containment. <br />
Crews will keep preparing roads to be used as control features through chipping and thinning operations as well as removing snags to <br />
reduce hazards to firefighters. As conditions allow, firefighters will use firing operations to improve the control features and bring the <br />
main fire toward the containment lines. <br />
<br />
<br />
East Zone Operations: Firefighters are using multiple strategies to protect the values in the Cascade Lakes region: point protection of <br />
homes and recreation infrastructure, containment lines to create a fire break and a safe zone for firing operations, and direct <br />
suppression where possible. After an assessment on Wednesday, conditions appear favorable to go direct on the edge of the fire east <br />
of Waldo Lake near Forest Road 4290 near Charlton Lake to keep the fire from moving farther south. That work will begin today. Night <br />
crews are being put in place in anticipation of burn operations. <br />
<br />
Protection efforts were completed at Willamette Pass and the ski area is being used for staging heavy equipment and structure prep <br />
supplies, such as water tanks, pumps, hoses, and sprinklers. Crews assessed the Gold Lake Campground and prepared for protection <br />
efforts there. Crews continued structure protection on the north shore of Odell Lake, Shelter Cove, and Sunset Cove, and south to <br />
assess the Diamond Peak area. To the north, structure protection efforts continued around Lava Lake, Cultus Lake, Crane Prairie <br />
Reservoir, and Twin Lakes.</span>

Sedro Woolley, WA – Weather conditions along with dry fuels continue to increase fire activity on the lightning-caused Chilliwack <br />
Complex. Increased easterly winds, high temperatures, and low humidity throughout the area have prompted a Red Flag Warning from <br />
the National Weather Service through Sunday evening. On Friday, the Copper Lake and Copper Ridge fires merged, and the North <br />
Fork and Little Chill fires merged. The two fires are now known as Copper Lake and Little Chill fires, respectively. The Silesia Fire had <br />
significant growth and is approximately one mile from the forest boundary with the Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest. This fire <br />
activity has prompted the closure of the Silesia Creek Trail. The Chilliwack Complex is made up of several active fires (Little Chill, <br />
Copper Lake, Brush Creek, Silesia, and Little Beaver Creek).<br />
<br />
 Crews continue protection measures on a pack bridge and suspension bridge near the Brush Creek Fire and on the cable car <br />
potentially threatened by the Copper Lake Fire. Firefighters continue to utilize helicopter bucket work on the Little Beaver Creek Fire.<br />
<br />
<br />
The Washington Department of Ecology announced an Air Quality Alert due to current wildfire smoke from the fires in the North <br />
Cascades. North and northeasterly winds are moving into the area, pushing regional smoke impacts from fires into the greater <br />
Bellingham-Seattle metropolitan area. Increasing smoke impacts, reduced visibility and short periods of UNHEALTHY air quality are <br />
expected into Sunday. As southwest winds return late Sunday, smoke impacts will shift back into the Wenatchee, Chelan, and <br />
Okanogan valleys. Take precautions when recreating outdoors when heavy smoke is present. Learn more at Real-Time Air Quality Map <br />
| PurpleAir, airnow.gov or visit https://wasmoke.blogspot.com/.  <br />
  <br />
Trail and camp closures remain in effect due to fire activity. Closure information can be found at <br />
https://www.nps.gov/noca/planyourvisit/trail-conditions.htm  <br />

Due to decreased fire activity, this will be the last daily update. If conditions change, information will be shared via the Crockets Knob <br />
Fire’s Facebook and Inciweb.  <br />
<br />
 Weather: Today will be dry with light winds. Temperatures will be in the low-70s, and the minimal relative humidity will be near 25 <br />
percent. Widespread smoke haze will be visible throughout <br />
the area.  <br />
<br />
Operations: Yesterday two excavators began conducting suppression repairs on the fire. One excavator worked along FSR 4555 and <br />
the other along interior containment lines near Indian <br />
Rock Lookout. The excavators were scattering fuels and constructing water bars. Crews continued to patrol containment lines all <br />
around the fire looking for any remaining heat. For the <br />
foreseeable future, firefighters will continue focusing on suppression repairs, monitoring and patrol along containment lines.  <br />
<br />
Closures and Evacuations:  There are no county evacuation alerts, and County Road 20 (Middle Fork Road) is open to all motorists.  <br />
<br />
The Malheur and Umatilla National Forests’ fire area closure remains in effect for areas east of FSR 45. However, the Forests’ will likely <br />
reduce the closure area within the next day or two. To <br />
stay informed about closure information, please continue checking: https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/malheur/notices/?<br />
cid=STELPRD3845529   <br />
<br />
Smoke may be visible to nearby communities and Forest visitors. Smoke and air quality impacts within the state can be monitored by <br />
visiting: http://oregonsmoke.blogspot.com <br />
<br />
The Malheur National Forest’s Public Use Restriction is Phase C on the Blue Mountain and Prairie City Ranger Districts. No campfires <br />
or personal chainsaw use is allowed. The Umatilla <br />
National Forest remains in Phase B, which allows campfires only in designated campgrounds and recreation sites. For more <br />
information, please go to: <br />
https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/malheur/fire, and  <br />
<br />
https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/umatilla/alerts-notices. <br />
<br />
Fire Danger remains Extreme for the surrounding area. The public can help us by making good decisions when they recreate on public <br />
lands and by following local fire restrictions.</span>

Double Creek, Sturgill, Nebo, Goat Mountain Two Fires <br />
<br />
September 15, 2022 <br />
<br />
Daily Update – 8:00 AM <br />
<br />
<br />
Highlights: The Wallowa County Sheriff’s Office rescinded all evacuation levels yesterday after reviewing the increased containment <br />
level on Double Creek Fire, progress made on the fires in Eagle Cap Wilderness, and moderating weather. The thunderstorms, and <br />
associated lightning, that passed through the area on Tuesday resulted in three new fire starts. Initial attack responded to two fires <br />
south of the Double Creek Fire yesterday and one to the north. Pacific Northwest Team 2 is committed to supporting initial attack in the <br />
region and will continue to monitor the area for any new starts in the coming days.  <br />
<br />
<br />
There will be a community meeting to discuss the Double Creek, Sturgill, Nebo, and Goat Mountain 2 Fires on Friday, September 16 at <br />
6 p.m. The meeting will be held at the Joseph Event Center (102 E First, Joseph, OR) and streamed live on Facebook. <br />
<br />
<br />
Double Creek Fire: 157,088 acres | 23% contained |759 personnel assigned  <br />
<br />
The lightning caused Double Creek Fire is a full suppression fire, and the protection of lives and property remain the primary objectives <br />
of this incident. Firefighters working the north end of the fire were busy yesterday responding to a new start. They also worked on <br />
connecting the fire line between Horse Creek and Lightning Creek, down to Dunbar Road, to protect private structures in the area. <br />
Crews continued working on the north end of the fire that spotted over the Imnaha River on September 10. They continue to strengthen <br />
fireline and perform mop up operations. Fire managers are anticipating that the spot fire will be in patrol status soon. Today, crews in the <br />
south will continue working on the Morgan Ridge trail system and work on creating a north-south fireline on Saddle Road. This will help <br />
build additional protection for Imnaha River Woods if the fire were to move further south. <br />
<br />
<br />
Eagle Cap Wilderness Fires  <br />
<br />
There are three lightning caused fires within the Eagle Cap Wilderness. The Nebo, Sturgill, and Goat Mountain 2 Fires are being <br />
managed to protect public and private infrastructure, while playing a natural role within designated Wilderness.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Nebo Fire: 12,563 acres | 0% contained | 90 personnel assigned<br />
<br />
Crews were able to continue chipping operations yesterday after the fire received more than 0.10 inches of rain on Tuesday. About one <br />
mile of chipping still needs to be completed on the 39 Road. The dozer line to the north of the fire and the line to the southeast of the <br />
fire are still focal areas on the Nebo Fire. Crews will work to wrap up the chipping and clean up on 39 Road today and continue to push <br />
forward on the northern and southeastern lines. <br />
<br />
<br />
Sturgill Fire: 20,036 acres | 0% contained | 64 personnel assigned <br />
<br />
Smokejumpers were pulled out of the Sturgill Fire area yesterday with the completion of structure protection efforts. Masticators are still <br />
operating on the Lostine River Road to help strengthen a north-south line that could stop any potential eastern progression of the fire. <br />
The primary work that remains on the Sturgill Fire is the shaded fuel break to the north along Bear Creek Road. <br />
<br />
<br />
Goat Mountain 2 Fire: 535 acres | 0% contained | 0 personnel assigned<br />
<br />
Fire activity on the Goat Mountain 2 Fire is minimal. Firefighters will continue to monitor the fire by air as smoke and weather permit.</span>

Overview: The Goat Rocks Fire continues to burn 1.5 miles northeast of the town of Packwood, Washington in the Goat Rocks <br />
Wilderness area. The steep rugged terrain and dense stands of timber have challenged suppression efforts, but cooler weather <br />
conditions are now assisting fire crews in suppressing the fire. Wilderness areas are established to protect and preserve natural <br />
ecosystems and wild areas. These areas provide opportunities for solitude and retrospective or primitive recreation.<br />
<br />
Fire Activity: Yesterday, crews continued prepping along the 46 Road north of the fire with masticators and hand crews. After scouting <br />
the fire’s edge, personnel determined that construction of any line along the fire’s edge would be unsafe. The steep terrain and dry <br />
loose soil make footing difficult and trees more likely to fall. Considering this, additional equipment has been ordered to assist with the <br />
road clearing, which is creating a containment line indirectly around the fire. With less smoke and better weather conditions helicopters <br />
were able to fly for a period of time, dropping several loads of water on the fire’s edge.<br />
<br />
Today, fire resources will be continuing their work along the 46 Road heading towards the Clear Fork Trailhead. Hand crews will be <br />
working along the Clear Fork Trail to continue creating an indirect fire break around the fire. Additionally, a Wildland Fire Use Module <br />
(WFM) arrived that will be working in the Goat Rocks Wilderness area utilizing trails and natural features to create a containment line. A <br />
WFM is a crew that specializes in working in wilderness or remote areas with little logistical support. This crew will be working and <br />
camping in the Goat Rocks Wilderness Area to monitor the southeast section of the fire.<br />
<br />
Forest Closures: US Hwy-12 and Highway 123 are both now open for traffic in both directions, but fire managers are asking the public <br />
to exercise caution on the roads as fire vehicles and personnel are operating in the area. Forest Roads 1260, 1262, 1266, 4600, 4610, <br />
4612, 4830 and all connected spur roads remain closed. Additionally, #65 (Bluff Lake), #69 (Three Peaks), #74 (Pipeline Road), #61 <br />
(Clear Fork Trail from the trailhead to the Clear Lost Trail), #76 (Clear Lost Trail from the junction of the Clear Fork Trail to the junction <br />
of the Packwood Lake Trail), and #78 (Packwood Lake Trail) are closed. Hikers can continue to access the Clear Lost Trailhead but can <br />
only hike south on the Clear Fork Trail.</span>

<br />
Plain, WA – Lightning started the White River and Irving Peak Fires on August 11th. The Minnow Ridge Fire cause is undetermined. <br />
These fires are burning on the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest.<br />
<br />
Suppression Strategy – Due to rugged and steep terrain, fire managers continue to implement a long-term strategy to manage these <br />
fires, including the use of primary and contingency perimeter lines for containment. Tactics include completion and reinforcement of fire <br />
lines utilizing forest roads and constructed hand line.<br />
<br />
Current Situation – A local Type 3 Incident Management Team assumed command of the fires on September 7th and is currently <br />
managing the White River, Irving Peak, Meander, and now Minnow Ridge fires. The Meander Fire remains at 6 acres with very minimal <br />
fire activity. Smoke may be visible over the next several weeks as interior fuels continue to smolder and burn out, and multiple fires burn <br />
region-wide. Updates will be posted weekly unless significant new activity occurs.<br />
<br />
White River Fire – Acres: 3,184 (as of 9/13/2022); 5% contained; Location: Sears Creek area of the White River drainage, <br />
approximately 14 miles NW of Plain, WA.<br />
The fire area remains drier and more active along the southern edges. The fire footprint remains within the control lines, and geographic <br />
features being utilized as containment lines. Firefighters are working to establish an anchor point and maintain the structure protection <br />
along Sears Creek Road and Windmill Lane.<br />
<br />
Irving Peak Fire – Acres: 3,226 (as of 9/9/2022); 5% contained; Location: Approximately 16 miles NW of Plain, WA<br />
The Irving Peak Fire received some precipitation yesterday with minimal growth and fire activity. Firefighters continue to improve roads <br />
used as containment lines and monitor fire activity.<br />
<br />
Minnow Ridge Fire – Acres: 502 (as of 9/13/2022); 0% contained; Location: Chikamin Ridge, approximately 14 miles N of Plain, WA.<br />
Fire activity has been moderate and mainly consuming ground fuels. Firefighters continue scouting forest roads and fire lines previously <br />
utilized during past wildfire activity to determine if they may benefit the current fire suppression strategy.  <br />
<br />
Weather – A chance of showers exists over the fire area today, Wednesday, September 14th, with west winds around 6-8 mph. Cooler <br />
temperatures and higher relative humidity continue into later this week.<br />
<br />
Air Quality and Smoke – Current information about air quality and health recommendations during smoky conditions is available on the <br />
Washington Smoke Blog https://wasmoke.blogspot.com/<br />
<br />
Closures – An emergency closure issued by the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest remains in place and can be viewed here: <br />
www.fs.usda.gov/alerts/okawen/alerts-notices. The PCT remains open and is not directly impacted by these fires. Several trails in the <br />
Chikamin Ridge area are pending closure due to the Minnow Ridge Fire. Fire managers are asking people to please respect these <br />
closures while recreating in the area.<br />
<br />
Restrictions – Campfires are not allowed anywhere within the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest. Stage 2 Restrictions are now in <br />
effect for the entire forest, including campgrounds and wilderness areas: www.fs.usda.gov/detail/okawen/alerts-notices/?<br />
cid=fsbdev3_053600.<br />
<br />
Evacuations – Current Chelan County evacuation levels include a Level 2 evacuation (Be Prepared) for Sears Creek Road and Level 1 <br />
(Stay Alert) for White River Road and Little Wenatchee Road. www.co.chelan.wa.us/emergency-management/pages/active-<br />

						    <span class="textarea">Overview: The Kalama Fire, located southeast of Kalama Horse Camp on the south side of Mount St. Helens, is currently at <br />
approximately 112 acres in size.  This number of acres will be updated with better mapping from an infra-red flight once conditions allow <br />
the flight to occur.<br />
<br />
Fire Behavior: The fire was located on a cliff face and is now on extremely steep ground, fire fighters are preparing indirect lines in more <br />
favorable terrain where they can be successful.  Fire behavior has been smoldering and creeping. The potential for fire growth remains, <br />
but containment lines are being put in place and contain percentage information will be updated when the lines are complete and <br />
holding.<br />
<br />
Weather: Weather today is favorable with light rain, light winds and higher relative humidity. <br />

						    <span class="textarea">Increased fire activity on some of the lightning caused fires, burning in the very remote, steep, and inaccessible terrain in the northwest <br />
corner of the Pasayten Wilderness Area, spurred trail and area closures over the holiday weekend. Hot, dry, and windy conditions are <br />
expected today as a trough moves into the area which is expected to create conditions for increased fire behavior. The Shull, The <br />
Parks, Kid, Three Fools, Skagit, and Elbow fires, located near the Canadian-U.S border, are expected to grow in acreage today.<br />
<br />
In a joint delegation with the National Park Service, a National Incident Management Organization Team, NIMO Team 2, assumed <br />
command yesterday over the six fires now being called the NW Pasayten Fires, located in the Pasayten Wilderness on the Methow <br />
Valley Ranger District of the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest, as well as the Chilliwack Complex Fires within the North Cascades <br />
National Park Service Complex.<br />
<br />
A number of closures are in effect including an area closure for the Freezeout Creek basin and a number of trails and portions of trails <br />
in the area. Portions of both the Pacific Crest Trail and Pacific Northwest Trail remain closed at this time.<br />
<br />
Smoke from these fires, and other fires burning in the region, may impact north central Washington communities over the next few <br />
days. Take precautions when recreating outdoors when heavy smoke is present. Learn more at Real-Time Air Quality Map | PurpleAir, <br />

<br />
Update on individual NW Pasayten Fires:<br />
•     The Kid Fire, located on the ridge between Rock Creek and West Fork Pasayten, is approximately 8 miles south of the Canadian-<br />
U.S. border. The fire has been very active with spotting and torching of grouped trees. Yesterday, smokejumpers worked on protection <br />
of the historic airport cabin, situated about one quarter mile away from the Kid Fire, utilizing pumps and sprinklers. If conditions allow, <br />
smokejumpers will also be burning out unburned brush between the fire and the cabin.<br />
•     The Parks Fire is also very active. It crossed the border into Canada a couple of days ago. There is a Canadian Incident <br />
Management Team assigned to the Canadian portion (called the Heather Fire north of the border) of the Parks Fire. The fire is about <br />
one half mile from the Monument 83 Fire Lookout at the time of this release. Firefighters have prepared the lookout by wrapping the <br />
base with fire protective wrap.<br />
•    The Skagit Fire, located in Freezeout Creek 6 miles south of the border, spread northward and crossed over the top of the ridge and <br />
down the other side.<br />
•     Three Fools Fire, located 8 miles south of the border, is actively backing down the ridge and through an old burn scar, it has spotted <br />
north of the ridge. <br />
•     The Elbow Fire, located 6 miles south of the border, is actively backing down the slope near Skagit Peak.<br />
•     Tuesday, fire activity increased on the Shull Fire located 11 miles south of the border.</span>

Mild weather at Rum Creek Fire <br />
<br />
MERLIN, Ore. – High relative humidity and moderate temperatures continue to keep fire activity low on the Rum Creek Fire. Dead fuels <br />
are gradually absorbing moisture from the air, making them less likely to burn. Similar weather and fire behavior are expected to last <br />
into next week, with a chance of rain this weekend. <br />
<br />
No significant fire activity was reported Wednesday although residual fuels continued to burn. A helicopter reconnaissance flight <br />
checked remote areas of the fire’s interior, with a similar flight planned today.  <br />
<br />
Resources completed repair work on contingency lines south of Galice Road and Bear Camp Road toward Chrome Mountain. <br />
Resources are shifting from that area to other parts of the fire where repair work remains to be completed. Fire personnel aim to <br />
complete waterbars and other soil stabilization work before heavy fall and winter rains arrive. Surplus resources are being released to <br />
other fires or home. <br />
<br />
Acreage has not increased for several days, and containment has risen to 83%. The uncontained section of the fire perimeter is <br />
adjacent to the Rogue River on the north side of the fire. Limited mop up is being done there due to extensive hazards to firefighters <br />
including very steep slopes, falling trees and rolling rocks. <br />
<br />
Evacuations: Evacuation information by address can be found at //JosephineCounty.gov/FireMap. For the most current evacuation <br />
information and resources, go to Josephine County Incident Information (rvem.org) <br />
<br />
Road Closures: Josephine County Sheriff’s Office has established traffic access points around the fire zone. Only residents (must show <br />
proof of residency) and permitted users will be allowed through. Road blocks are located at: <br />
<br />
Galice Road north of junction with Bear Camp Road;  <br />
Peavine East Road at Bear Camp Road;  <br />
Peavine West Road at Upper Bear Camp Road;  <br />
Quartz Creek Road about 3 miles up (end of County maintenance);  <br />
Stratton Creek Road at Galice Road;  <br />
Hog Creek Road at Galice Road;  <br />
Lower Grave Creek Road at Angora Creek (Grays Ranch);  <br />
Grave Creek Road at the bridge by Grave Creek Boat Ramp.  <br />
The Reuben Mountain Road between Lower Grave Creek Road and Dutch Henry Road is open, but grading and other repair work is <br />
obstructing this road. The public is asked to stay off the Reuben Mountain Road until repair work is completed. <br />
<br />
Recreation Area Closures: <br />
<br />
Rainie Falls Trail is closed. <br />
Rogue River Trail is closed from Grave Creek to Russian Creek.  <br />
Rogue River is closed from Ennis Riffle to Grave Creek boat ramp. Permitted boaters can still put in at Grave Creek.  <br />
On the closed section of Galice Road, Smullin Visitor Center, Argo Recreation Site and Boat Ramp, and Galice Boat Ramp are closed. <br />
River status: The Rogue River is open to boating down to Ennis Riffle. Boats must pull out of the water at Indian Mary or Ennis Riffle <br />
County Park. The river is closed between Ennis Riffle and Grave Creek boat ramp due to fire activity and hazards. The Wild section of <br />
the Rogue River below Grave Creek will remain open unless fire conditions warrant closure. River status is determined on a day-to-day <br />
basis. Please call 541-471-6535 for more information regarding Rogue River permits. No new boating permits will be issued at this <br />
time.</span>

<br />
Klamath Falls, Ore. – Last night fire crews continued to use infrared cameras to identify areas of heat around the perimeter of the fire. <br />
They are mainly finding heat under juniper trees on the southern and western areas.<br />
<br />
Today is the last day the Oregon Department of Forestry’s Type 1 Incident Management Team will be in command of the fire. Transition <br />
to the local Type 4 team will happen tomorrow at noon. The objectives for the local team will remain the same. Multiple engines and <br />
crews will continue to mop up where it warrants.<br />
<br />
Weather today will be cooler and more humid. Gusty winds are expected in the late afternoon and early evening.<br />
<br />
Residential traffic is allowed in the fire area, but residents are encouraged to drive slowly and be aware of fire operation traffic as they <br />
travel through the fire. Bureau of Land Management lands in and around the fire area remain closed to the public.<br />
<br />
We would like to remind the public that Klamath and Lake counties are still in extreme fire danger. Human-cause fire stats are down this <br />
fire season, so please help your local resources by preventing anything that can spark a fire. Visit <br />
https://www.oregon.gov/odf/fire/pages/restrictions.aspx for fire restrictions in your area or areas you may be traveling to.  <br />
<br />
This will be the final fire update from the ODF IMT. The team would like to thank the cooperators and public for their support during the <br />
fire. Without local resources and support from the community our team would not have been as successful.</span>

						    <span class="textarea">White River and Irving Peak Fire Update<br />
September 14, 2022<br />
<br />
Plain, WA – Lightning started the White River and Irving Peak Fires on August 11th. The Minnow Ridge Fire cause is undetermined. <br />
These fires are burning on the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest.<br />
<br />
Suppression Strategy – Due to rugged and steep terrain, fire managers continue to implement a long-term strategy to manage these <br />
fires, including the use of primary and contingency perimeter lines for containment. Tactics include completion and reinforcement of fire <br />
lines utilizing forest roads and constructed hand line.<br />
<br />
Current Situation – A local Type 3 Incident Management Team assumed command of the fires on September 7th and is currently <br />
managing the White River, Irving Peak, Meander, and now Minnow Ridge fires. The Meander Fire remains at 6 acres with very minimal <br />
fire activity. Smoke may be visible over the next several weeks as interior fuels continue to smolder and burn out, and multiple fires burn <br />
region-wide. Updates will be posted weekly unless significant new activity occurs.<br />
<br />
White River Fire – Acres: 3,184 (as of 9/13/2022); 5% contained; Location: Sears Creek area of the White River drainage, <br />
approximately 14 miles NW of Plain, WA.<br />
The fire area remains drier and more active along the southern edges. The fire footprint remains within the control lines, and geographic <br />
features being utilized as containment lines. Firefighters are working to establish an anchor point and maintain the structure protection <br />
along Sears Creek Road and Windmill Lane.<br />
<br />
Irving Peak Fire – Acres: 3,226 (as of 9/9/2022); 5% contained; Location: Approximately 16 miles NW of Plain, WA<br />
The Irving Peak Fire received some precipitation yesterday with minimal growth and fire activity. Firefighters continue to improve roads <br />
used as containment lines and monitor fire activity.<br />
<br />
Minnow Ridge Fire – Acres: 502 (as of 9/13/2022); 0% contained; Location: Chikamin Ridge, approximately 14 miles N of Plain, WA.<br />
Fire activity has been moderate and mainly consuming ground fuels. Firefighters continue scouting forest roads and fire lines previously <br />
utilized during past wildfire activity to determine if they may benefit the current fire suppression strategy.  <br />
<br />
Weather – A chance of showers exists over the fire area today, Wednesday, September 14th, with west winds around 6-8 mph. Cooler <br />
temperatures and higher relative humidity continue into later this week.<br />
<br />
Air Quality and Smoke – Current information about air quality and health recommendations during smoky conditions is available on the <br />
Washington Smoke Blog https://wasmoke.blogspot.com/<br />
<br />
Closures – An emergency closure issued by the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest remains in place and can be viewed here: <br />
www.fs.usda.gov/alerts/okawen/alerts-notices. The PCT remains open and is not directly impacted by these fires. Several trails in the <br />
Chikamin Ridge area are pending closure due to the Minnow Ridge Fire. Fire managers are asking people to please respect these <br />
closures while recreating in the area.<br />
<br />
Restrictions – Campfires are not allowed anywhere within the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest. Stage 2 Restrictions are now in <br />
effect for the entire forest, including campgrounds and wilderness areas: www.fs.usda.gov/detail/okawen/alerts-notices/?<br />
cid=fsbdev3_053600.<br />
<br />
Evacuations – Current Chelan County evacuation levels include a Level 2 evacuation (Be Prepared) for Sears Creek Road and Level 1 <br />
(Stay Alert) for White River Road and Little Wenatchee Road. www.co.chelan.wa.us/emergency-management/pages/active-<br />
