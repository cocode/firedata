<br />
Yesterday, the Bull Complex grew just under 1,000 acres as temperatures reached into the mid-80s and relative <br />
humidity dropped to the high teens.  The fire was mainly active to the west and south, burning uphill in the Elk <br />
Lake Creek and Mother Lode Creek drainages.  It is burning rapidly through the 2011 Mother Lode Fire area, <br />
consuming the large dead and down material which is much drier than the live timber stands.  The fire is nearing <br />
the border of the Willamette National Forest.  There are no evacuation warnings or orders at this time.  Fire <br />
managers are in continuous communication with Marion County officials to ensure that safe and timely <br />
evacuations occur should they become necessary. <br />
<br />
On the eastern side of the fire, firefighters continue to improve their pre-identified containment lines and <br />
successfully prevent additional spread to the east and north.  They did ignite vegetation along their firelines in the <br />
northeast corner to slowly connect it to the main fire.  They will continue to monitor the fire perimeter in that area <br />
to ensure it does not cross the lines so they can call that section contained.  However, the overall percentage <br />
may not increase drastically given the amount of growth that has occurred on the southwestern side of the fire.  <br />
Firelines are also holding on the southeastern corner, where additional tactical fires have been used to reduce <br />
the intensity of the main fire and limit spread beyond the containment lines.   <br />
<br />
Winds shifted to the west overnight, dropping temperatures and raising humidity.  The fire should be less active <br />
today under these conditions.  Smoke is expected to be heavy in the valleys again this morning but will lift in the <br />
afternoon with light winds continuing from the west.  Tomorrow’s weather will also be cooler.  Wednesday and <br />
Thursday, light eastern winds return, bringing another warm and dry period. <br />
<br />
Closures:  For the safety of wildland firefighters and the public, the National Forests have enacted area closures <br />
that prevent the public from being upon National Forest System lands in the vicinity of the Bull Complex where <br />
uncontrolled fire and fire suppression activities are occurring. All Forest lands that are south and west of Forest <br />
Road 46, and east of the Riverside Fire perimeter are closed. The entire length of Forest Road 46 is closed. <br />
Lands within the 2020 Lionshead and Beachie Creek Fire areas are also closed.  See the closure orders and <br />
maps at https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/closures/7773/. <br />
<br />
Contractors approved by the Forest Service through a permit system are allowed through the closure order, as <br />
are vendors and others working on recovery efforts related to the 2020 area fires.  Breitenbush Hot Springs <br />
Resort is open; however, reservations are required to pass through a roadblock on Forest Road 46. <br />

<br />
Kettle Falls, WA – Yesterday, firefighters conducted a burning operation on the northern flank of the Bulldog <br />
Mountain Fire. The weather and fuel conditions were optimal for the occasion and everything went well. <br />
Crews will continue to work on burnout operations today, with air resources monitoring and assisting where <br />
needed.  The southeast flank of the Bulldog Mountain Fire has shown active fire behavior with the warm <br />
weather that the fire areas are experiencing. Firefighters will continue to patrol and take actions to hold the <br />
remainder of the fire within containment lines.  <br />
<br />
The removal of dangerous snags and chipping will continue along the South Boulder road and in the Davis <br />
Lake area to prepare these roads in the event that the fire moves out of its current footprint. Crews will also <br />
work on grading the roads around both the Bulldog Mountain and Mack Mountain Fires.  <br />
<br />
On the Mack Mountain fire, crews will continue to monitor and improve fire lines. Air resources will monitor <br />
both the Bulldog Mountain and Mack Mountain Fires for active fire behavior.  <br />
<br />
Today, the warmer weather will continue with low relative humidity and higher southwest winds later in the <br />
afternoon. The weather is expected to take a turn on Tuesday as another cold front moves into the area with <br />
possible showers going into Wednesday.  <br />
<br />
Citizens should remain vigilant and are strongly encouraged to sign up for alerts at  Ferry County Alerts.  <br />
Motorists traveling on Boulder Hwy and SR395 should watch for heavy equipment and firefighters turning off <br />
and onto the roadway. Firefighter and public safety is our number one priority.  <br />
<br />
Smoke: Current weather conditions will moderate smoke impacts throughout the area today.  <br />
<br />
Closures: An area closure is in effect on Colville National Forest lands in the vicinity of the Bulldog Mountain <br />
Fire. For more information on area and road closures on the Colville National Forest, please visit: <br />
https://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fseprd938379.pdf <br />
<br />
Citizens are asked to stay clear of the fire area and comply with area closures.  <br />
<br />
While current weather conditions provide respite from the extreme fire potential present in northeast <br />
Washington, the forest can quickly dry out again in the many weeks of fire season ahead. Please continue to <br />
do all you can to prevent wildfires. <br />
<br />
The Colville National Forest is at IFPL level 3. Road closures remain in effect.  <br />
<br />
The Incident Command Post is located in Inchelium, WA. A spike camp will remain in place in Kettle Falls, WA <br />
to support the Bulldog Mountain and Mack Mountain Fires.</span>

Winthrop, WA – The Cedar Creek, Cub Creek 2, and Delancy fires are burning on the Okanogan-Wenatchee <br />
National Forest and public and private lands within Okanogan County.<br />
<br />
Safety Note: The Cedar and Cub Creek Fires are active fires, and certain roads and trails in the community <br />
and Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest remain closed for your safety. The public is reminded to stay out <br />
of closed areas for your safety and the safety of firefighters.<br />
<br />
Fire Information Line: (509) 557-0740 (8:00 am to 8:00 pm daily)<br />
<br />
Cedar Creek Fire: The fire is 55,187 acres and 80% contained. High pressure settled over the region <br />
Saturday resulting in near-full sunshine and shading. The day was much drier than the previous two days with <br />
temperatures in the 80s. Winds were light and terrain driven. We saw minimal fire behavior Saturday and <br />
overnight. As mop up continues in the burned area, crews will be focused on removing any heat near <br />
structures utilizing an infrared camera to aid in this work. Hand lines that were put in to contain the fire near <br />
Early Winters Creek are being repaired, and excavators will work to repair dozer lines along other sections of <br />
the fire.<br />
<br />
Cub Creek 2 Fire: The Cub Creek 2 Fire is 70,186 acres and 70% contained. Smoke seen on the southern <br />
edge of the fire was quickly mopped up by engines. Falling crews are working to remove hazard trees in the <br />
Nice Campground. In the area around the Brevicomis summer homes, an infrared camera will help fire <br />
personnel to find and remove any remaining heat. Mop up will also continue in the riparian corridor around <br />
Bud Creek, where crews are systematically searching for and removing pockets of heat. Resource advisors <br />
are flagging areas for suppression repair. Excavators will repair dozer lines along the western edge of the fire.<br />
<br />
Delancy Fire: The Delancy Fire is being monitored by aerial surveillance and remains at 223 acres and 95% <br />
containment.<br />
<br />
Fire Weather: A warm-up is expected for the weekend as high pressure settles over the region. Temperatures <br />
will return to normal with highs in the lower 80s. It will also be much drier with humidity minimums between 20 <br />
and 30 percent. Winds are expected to be light and terrain-driven, with speeds under 15 mph.<br />
<br />
Closures: For the safety of the firefighters and aircraft fighting these fires, a temporary flight restriction (TFR) <br />
has been placed over the area. Please consult the “Notice to Airmen” (NOTAM) at FAA.gov for specifics. <br />
Wildfires are a “No Drone Zone” and any drone sighting in a TFR will lead to the immediate grounding of <br />
aerial firefighting resources and delay suppression actions.<br />
<br />
The following trails are currently closed: Cedar Creek Trail, Driveway Butte Trail, Lone Fire Trail, Cutthroat <br />
NRT Trail, and Wolf Creek Trail. <br />
<br />
The Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest has implemented a Fire Emergency Area Closure as of July 22, <br />
2021. The Closure includes facilities, roads, and trails. The Closure may be viewed in its entirety at the “Cedar <br />
Creek and Delancy Fires 2021” Facebook page or https://www.fs.usda.gov/okawen.      <br />
<br />
Fire Restrictions: Campfire restrictions are in effect. Campfires are prohibited throughout the Okanogan-<br />
Wenatchee National Forest, including developed campgrounds and congressionally designated Wilderness.<br />
<br />
Call local ranger district offices for more information.<br />
<br />
Fire Restrictions Information: https://www.fs.usda.gov/alerts/okawen/alerts-notices.<br />
<br />
Driving in the area: Communities in the fire area are currently open. Visitors and local residents are <br />
encouraged to exercise caution when driving in the area. Smoke will reduce visibility and increase the <br />
potential for accidents. Use headlights when driving in smoke and please stay focused on the road. Drivers <br />
are urged to exercise caution with school now in session. Displaced wildlife is moving around lower elevations <br />
as well.</span>

The Chickadee Creek Fire is located approximately 15 miles west of Tonasket, Washington. The Walker Creek <br />
Fire is located approximately 13 miles east/northeast of Tonasket, Washington, surrounding Lake Bonaparte.<br />
The Incident Command Post at the Omak Stampede Grounds is closed to all but essential personnel to help <br />
ensure the health and safety of community members and firefighters. Temperatures today will be 75 to 80 <br />
degrees, with gusty northerly winds starting this afternoon and continuing tonight.<br />
Operations<br />
Some additional resources arrived yesterday to help offset personnel and equipment that were de-mobilized from <br />
these fires as they timed out on their assignments and returned home to rest and refurbish their equipment.<br />
Chickadee Creek Fire<br />
Fire crews finished installing hose lays on the northern fire perimeter, to allow water delivery to remaining heat <br />
sources near the fire line. Firefighters completed a burnout operation above the road on the eastern fire <br />
perimeter, securing that portion of the fire line. Heavy helicopters were also active on the eastern flank of the fire <br />
yesterday, performing water drops to cool hot spots in support of crews working on the ground.<br />
<br />
Evacuations<br />
Evacuation levels can be viewed at the Okanogan County Walker Creek and Chickadee Fire web page at <br />
https://tinyurl.com/6dt8kytx.<br />
Closures<br />
Four road closures remain on the Walker Creek Fire: Bonaparte Lake Road, Summer Road, Diamond Belle <br />
Road, and Bunch Road. These closures are located north of Highway 20 and terminate on the Colville National <br />
Forest.<br />
The Colville National Forest area closure remains in effect.</span>

Winthrop, WA – The Cedar Creek, Cub Creek 2, and Delancy fires are burning on the Okanogan-Wenatchee <br />
National Forest and public and private lands within Okanogan County.<br />
<br />
Safety Note: The Cedar and Cub Creek Fires are active fires, and certain roads and trails in the community <br />
and Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest remain closed for your safety. The public is reminded to stay out <br />
of closed areas for your safety and the safety of firefighters.<br />
<br />
Fire Information Line: (509) 557-0740 (8:00 am to 8:00 pm daily)<br />
<br />
Cedar Creek Fire: The fire is 55,187 acres and 80% contained. High pressure settled over the region <br />
Saturday resulting in near-full sunshine and shading. The day was much drier than the previous two days with <br />
temperatures in the 80s. Winds were light and terrain driven. We saw minimal fire behavior Saturday and <br />
overnight. As mop up continues in the burned area, crews will be focused on removing any heat near <br />
structures utilizing an infrared camera to aid in this work. Hand lines that were put in to contain the fire near <br />
Early Winters Creek are being repaired, and excavators will work to repair dozer lines along other sections of <br />
the fire.<br />
<br />
Cub Creek 2 Fire: The Cub Creek 2 Fire is 70,186 acres and 70% contained. Smoke seen on the southern <br />
edge of the fire was quickly mopped up by engines. Falling crews are working to remove hazard trees in the <br />
Nice Campground. In the area around the Brevicomis summer homes, an infrared camera will help fire <br />
personnel to find and remove any remaining heat. Mop up will also continue in the riparian corridor around <br />
Bud Creek, where crews are systematically searching for and removing pockets of heat. Resource advisors <br />
are flagging areas for suppression repair. Excavators will repair dozer lines along the western edge of the fire.<br />
<br />
Delancy Fire: The Delancy Fire is being monitored by aerial surveillance and remains at 223 acres and 95% <br />
containment.<br />
<br />
Fire Weather: A warm-up is expected for the weekend as high pressure settles over the region. Temperatures <br />
will return to normal with highs in the lower 80s. It will also be much drier with humidity minimums between 20 <br />
and 30 percent. Winds are expected to be light and terrain-driven, with speeds under 15 mph.<br />
<br />
Closures: For the safety of the firefighters and aircraft fighting these fires, a temporary flight restriction (TFR) <br />
has been placed over the area. Please consult the “Notice to Airmen” (NOTAM) at FAA.gov for specifics. <br />
Wildfires are a “No Drone Zone” and any drone sighting in a TFR will lead to the immediate grounding of <br />
aerial firefighting resources and delay suppression actions.<br />
<br />
The following trails are currently closed: Cedar Creek Trail, Driveway Butte Trail, Lone Fire Trail, Cutthroat <br />
NRT Trail, and Wolf Creek Trail. <br />
<br />
The Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest has implemented a Fire Emergency Area Closure as of July 22, <br />
2021. The Closure includes facilities, roads, and trails. The Closure may be viewed in its entirety at the “Cedar <br />
Creek and Delancy Fires 2021” Facebook page or https://www.fs.usda.gov/okawen.      <br />
<br />
Fire Restrictions: Campfire restrictions are in effect. Campfires are prohibited throughout the Okanogan-<br />
Wenatchee National Forest, including developed campgrounds and congressionally designated Wilderness.<br />
<br />
Call local ranger district offices for more information.<br />
<br />
Fire Restrictions Information: https://www.fs.usda.gov/alerts/okawen/alerts-notices.<br />
<br />
Driving in the area: Communities in the fire area are currently open. Visitors and local residents are <br />
encouraged to exercise caution when driving in the area. Smoke will reduce visibility and increase the <br />
potential for accidents. Use headlights when driving in smoke and please stay focused on the road. Drivers <br />
are urged to exercise caution with school now in session. Displaced wildlife is moving around lower elevations <br />
as well.</span>

Winthrop, WA – The Cedar Creek, Cub Creek 2, and Delancy fires are burning on the Okanogan-Wenatchee <br />
National Forest and public and private lands within Okanogan County.<br />
<br />
Safety Note: The Cedar and Cub Creek Fires are active fires, and certain roads and trails in the community <br />
and Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest remain closed for your safety. The public is reminded to stay out <br />
of closed areas for your safety and the safety of firefighters.<br />
<br />
Fire Information Line: (509) 557-0740 (8:00 am to 8:00 pm daily)<br />
<br />
Cedar Creek Fire: The fire is 55,187 acres and 80% contained. High pressure settled over the region <br />
Saturday resulting in near-full sunshine and shading. The day was much drier than the previous two days with <br />
temperatures in the 80s. Winds were light and terrain driven. We saw minimal fire behavior Saturday and <br />
overnight. As mop up continues in the burned area, crews will be focused on removing any heat near <br />
structures utilizing an infrared camera to aid in this work. Hand lines that were put in to contain the fire near <br />
Early Winters Creek are being repaired, and excavators will work to repair dozer lines along other sections of <br />
the fire.<br />
<br />
Cub Creek 2 Fire: The Cub Creek 2 Fire is 70,186 acres and 70% contained. Smoke seen on the southern <br />
edge of the fire was quickly mopped up by engines. Falling crews are working to remove hazard trees in the <br />
Nice Campground. In the area around the Brevicomis summer homes, an infrared camera will help fire <br />
personnel to find and remove any remaining heat. Mop up will also continue in the riparian corridor around <br />
Bud Creek, where crews are systematically searching for and removing pockets of heat. Resource advisors <br />
are flagging areas for suppression repair. Excavators will repair dozer lines along the western edge of the fire.<br />
<br />
Delancy Fire: The Delancy Fire is being monitored by aerial surveillance and remains at 223 acres and 95% <br />
containment.<br />
<br />
Fire Weather: A warm-up is expected for the weekend as high pressure settles over the region. Temperatures <br />
will return to normal with highs in the lower 80s. It will also be much drier with humidity minimums between 20 <br />
and 30 percent. Winds are expected to be light and terrain-driven, with speeds under 15 mph.<br />
<br />
Closures: For the safety of the firefighters and aircraft fighting these fires, a temporary flight restriction (TFR) <br />
has been placed over the area. Please consult the “Notice to Airmen” (NOTAM) at FAA.gov for specifics. <br />
Wildfires are a “No Drone Zone” and any drone sighting in a TFR will lead to the immediate grounding of <br />
aerial firefighting resources and delay suppression actions.<br />
<br />
The following trails are currently closed: Cedar Creek Trail, Driveway Butte Trail, Lone Fire Trail, Cutthroat <br />
NRT Trail, and Wolf Creek Trail. <br />
<br />
The Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest has implemented a Fire Emergency Area Closure as of July 22, <br />
2021. The Closure includes facilities, roads, and trails. The Closure may be viewed in its entirety at the “Cedar <br />
Creek and Delancy Fires 2021” Facebook page or https://www.fs.usda.gov/okawen.      <br />
<br />
Fire Restrictions: Campfire restrictions are in effect. Campfires are prohibited throughout the Okanogan-<br />
Wenatchee National Forest, including developed campgrounds and congressionally designated Wilderness.<br />
<br />
Call local ranger district offices for more information.<br />
<br />
Fire Restrictions Information: https://www.fs.usda.gov/alerts/okawen/alerts-notices.<br />
<br />
Driving in the area: Communities in the fire area are currently open. Visitors and local residents are <br />
encouraged to exercise caution when driving in the area. Smoke will reduce visibility and increase the <br />
potential for accidents. Use headlights when driving in smoke and please stay focused on the road. Drivers <br />
are urged to exercise caution with school now in session. Displaced wildlife is moving around lower elevations <br />
as well.</span>

The Devil's Knob Complex is a group of lightning-caused fires on the Tiller Ranger District of the Umpqua <br />
National Forest and private lands protected by Douglas Forest Protective Association and the Cow Creek Band <br />
of the Umpqua Tribe of Indians.  <br />
<br />
Most growth within the complex has been concentrated along the north and east sides of the Smith Fire, <br />
although smoky conditions have somewhat limited fire behavior in recent days. If smoke clears, fire activity is <br />
anticipated to be moderate, but new smoke columns may appear.  <br />
<br />
Smith Fire (18,750 acres): The Smith Fire showed moderate activity yesterday along much of the east side from <br />
Coffeepot Creek to Dumont Creek, an area which is inaccessible and too hazardous to place firefighters. Efforts <br />
are underway to improve area roads ahead of the fire to act as fire breaks. Several columns were visible as fire <br />
activity increased when the lingering smoke moved out. Along the northwest perimeter, firefighters are preparing <br />
for strategic firing operations as additional Type I hand crews are en route. Helicopters are also providing support <br />
using water drops as weather allows. In Ash Valley, a system of hose lays and sprinklers is in place for structure <br />
protection, while crews continue using dozers and masticators to develop control lines to the north and east.  <br />
<br />
Big Hamlin Fire (14,122 acres): Firefighters are working on additional lines in the northeast as the fire continues <br />
to show gradual growth toward the 2925 road. Along the southeastern edge, crews have focused on strategic <br />
firing operations, cleaning up previous burns and adding more depth to the fireline. Containment lines along the <br />
western perimeter continue to hold.  <br />
<br />
Dismal Creek, Little Applegate, Mule Creek, Section 30 (Railroad) and Wild Cat fires (1,510 total acres): These <br />
fires are containedand remain in patrol status. <br />
<br />
Weather: A marine layer brought increased moisture and cooler temperatures today, with highs forecast in the <br />
70s. Hotter and drier conditions are anticipated for the remainder of the week, contributing to high potential for <br />
increased fire activity. However, smoke cover might moderate fire behavior. Winds should remain relatively light <br />
out of the northwest. <br />
<br />
Air Quality: Check latest conditions on the Oregon Smoke Information Blog: http://oregonsmoke.blogspot.com. <br />
<br />
Aviation Operations: Air resources are providing support where feasible and as weather allows. For the safety of <br />
firefighters and aircraft fighting the Devil’s Knob Complex, a  temporary flightrestriction remains in place over the <br />
fire area. Wildfires are also a “No Drone Zone.” <br />
<br />
Evacuations and Closures: Visit the Douglas County Sheriff Office’s interactive evacuation map at <br />
www.dcso.com/evacuations for the latest information. Residents can opt in to receiveemergency alerts by <br />
registering at www.dcso.com/alerts. <br />
<br />
The Forest Service has an Emergency Fire Closure restricting public access to most of Steamboat, North <br />
Umpqua, and South Umpqua. To view the Closure, go to https://www.fs.usda.gov/alerts/umpqua/alerts-notices.</span>

<br />
Current Situation: Green Ridge Fire: Activity on the Green Ridge Fire yesterday was minimal and this helped <br />
firefighters to make good progress. Today, the concern will be increased fire behavior due to predicted wind gusts <br />
up to 26 mph coming from the west-southwest.  An increase in burning activity and smoke is likely as the winds <br />
fan interior islands and pockets of unburned fuels. Firefighters will remain diligent in watching for spots and new <br />
smokes to extinguish.  The two areas of uncontrolled line in the northeast and southwest corners of the fire have <br />
now been contained.  Fire crews will continue to patrol and monitor these areas. Further progress was also made <br />
on direct containment of the fire in the southeast corner near Diamond Creek Road below Mount Misery.  The <br />
objective for this area of the fire is to establish containment line going south then west and tie into the Diamond <br />
Mountain trailhead. Resource advisors are onsite to provide knowledge of cultural and natural resource areas to <br />
be protected. Advisors are also mapping all suppression line constructed for future repair. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Current Situation: Lick Creek Fire: The Lick Creek Fire remains 80,421 acres and is now 100% contained. <br />
Smoke will continue to be visible as unburned pockets of vegetation inside the fire perimeter are consumed. <br />
Crews will continue to mop-up any interior pockets of heat and patrol lines as they can safely.  <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Weather & Smoke Information: Mostly sunny today with smoke and haze.  Temperatures will remain warm and <br />
may reach 69-75 degrees along the ridges and 75-80 degrees in the valley bottoms. Winds will be west-<br />
southwest 6-10 mph early in the day then increase to 10-15. There is the potential for gusts up to 26 mph in the <br />
afternoon. Relative humidity will remain in the low range from 20-25% above 5000 feet and 15-20% in the <br />
valleys. Smoke information is available on Washington Smoke Blog at: https://wasmoke.blogspot.com/  <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Forest Closures: A reduced Fire Emergency Closure is in place on the Umatilla National Forest and has been <br />
updated as of August 28, 2021. The closure order map can be found at <br />
https://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fseprd948170.pdf <br />
<br />

<br />
Evacuations: Garfield and Columbia County have dropped all Level 2 areas to Level 1 yesterday. For more <br />
information on evacuations, please visit https://go.usa.gov/xFQJ2 for full information.   <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Temporary Flight Restrictions: For the safety of the firefighters and aircraft fighting the Green Ridge and Lick <br />
Creek Fires, a Temporary Flight Restriction is in place over the fire areas. Please consult the “Notice to Airman” <br />
for specifics. Wildfires are a “No Drone Zone.”  Whenever a drone is spotted near the fire all aircraft are <br />
grounded until we can be sure the drone is clear of the area. For more information, visit <br />

Summary:  The Rough Patch Complex and Jack fire are being managed under a full suppression strategy using <br />
direct and indirect tactics to minimize fire spread to prevent loss of valuable resources. The Rough Patch <br />
consists of four fires: Chaos, Little Bend, Buckhead and Near Minky. Increased fire activity was observed across <br />
all fires yesterday.  <br />
<br />
  <br />
<br />
Chaos and Little Bend Fires:  The Chaos fire is at 17,688 acres and the Little Bend fire is at 6,862 acres. Fireline <br />
on the west side of the Chaos fire continues to hold. Yesterday, aircraft assisted with two spots across the road – <br />
the 3828 on the north side of the Chaos and the 3821 road along the southern boundary. Both spots were <br />
estimated at 3-5 acres. Crews will continue working them today, as well as holding and improving the southern <br />
boundary. Burning operations last night worked on completing the last section of direct fire line between Chaos <br />
and Little Bend on the 3821 road. <br />
<br />
  <br />
<br />
Jack and Buckhead Fires:  The Jack fire is at 23,922 acres and the Buckhead fire is at 3,286 acres. The west, <br />
north, and northeast end of the Jack fire has been contained and is being patrolled. Crews are preparing the <br />
2781 road for additional burning operations to bring fire from the Buckhead fire down to the Near Minky. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Near Minky Fire:  The Near Minky fire is at 4,741 acres. This fire is located south of the Jack and Buckhead fires. <br />
The eastern edge and a portion of the western edge have been contained. Northern Rockies Team 1 and the <br />
Florida Red Team continue to work closely together to address concerns with the Smith fire to the south <br />
<br />
  <br />
<br />
Weather:  Cooler weather is in the forecast for this week with temperatures in the 70’s. Northeast winds will be <br />
light, switching to northwest in the afternoon. Expect dense smoke in the lower elevations until the afternoon <br />
when winds shift to the north. <br />
<br />
  <br />

 <br />
Kettle Falls, WA – Yesterday, firefighters conducted a burning operation on the northern flank of the Bulldog <br />
Mountain Fire. The weather and fuel conditions were optimal for the occasion and everything went well. <br />
Crews will continue to work on burnout operations today, with air resources monitoring and assisting where <br />
needed.  The southeast flank of the Bulldog Mountain Fire has shown active fire behavior with the warm <br />
weather that the fire areas are experiencing. Firefighters will continue to patrol and take actions to hold the <br />
remainder of the fire within containment lines.  <br />
<br />
The removal of dangerous snags and chipping will continue along the South Boulder road and in the Davis <br />
Lake area to prepare these roads in the event that the fire moves out of its current footprint. Crews will also <br />
work on grading the roads around both the Bulldog Mountain and Mack Mountain Fires.  <br />
<br />
On the Mack Mountain fire, crews will continue to monitor and improve fire lines. Air resources will monitor <br />
both the Bulldog Mountain and Mack Mountain Fires for active fire behavior.  <br />
<br />
Today, the warmer weather will continue with low relative humidity and higher southwest winds later in the <br />
afternoon. The weather is expected to take a turn on Tuesday as another cold front moves into the area with <br />
possible showers going into Wednesday.  <br />
<br />
Citizens should remain vigilant and are strongly encouraged to sign up for alerts at  Ferry County Alerts.  <br />
Motorists traveling on Boulder Hwy and SR395 should watch for heavy equipment and firefighters turning off <br />
and onto the roadway. Firefighter and public safety is our number one priority.  <br />
<br />
Smoke: Current weather conditions will moderate smoke impacts throughout the area today.  <br />
<br />
Closures: An area closure is in effect on Colville National Forest lands in the vicinity of the Bulldog Mountain <br />
Fire. For more information on area and road closures on the Colville National Forest, please visit: <br />
https://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fseprd938379.pdf <br />
<br />
Citizens are asked to stay clear of the fire area and comply with area closures.  <br />
<br />
While current weather conditions provide respite from the extreme fire potential present in northeast <br />
Washington, the forest can quickly dry out again in the many weeks of fire season ahead. Please continue to <br />
do all you can to prevent wildfires. <br />
<br />
The Colville National Forest is at IFPL level 3. Road closures remain in effect.  <br />
<br />
The Incident Command Post is located in Inchelium, WA. A spike camp will remain in place in Kettle Falls, WA <br />
to support the Bulldog Mountain and Mack Mountain Fires.</span>

WESTFIR, Ore. – Lingering smoke moderated fire activity until midafternoon Sunday, when coastal breezes <br />
cleared the air, which in turn increased fire activity. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
On the Gales Fire, crews are reinforcing control lines, and strategically positioning resources in areas of the fire <br />
with increased fire activity, with assistance from helicopters providing water drops to cool the edge of the fire. An <br />
Air Attack plane provided eyes in the sky for firefighters on the ground, alerting them to changing conditions and <br />
movement of the fire. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Despite a Red Flag Warning and critical fire weather predicted for the weekend, firefighters were able to limit the <br />
spread on the Gales Fire to less than a thousand acres. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
The Kwis Fire footprint has held at 1,485 acres for more than a week. Firefighters are using infrared mapping to <br />
identify and extinguish hot spots within the fire footprint and removing flammable material from the edges of the <br />
fire to further reduce the possibility of fire spread.    <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
A community briefing video will be posted to Facebook late Tuesday afternoon. Weblinks will be posted on <br />
information boards and a Facebook account is not required to watch the video. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Weather: Clouds, low temperatures, and high humidities are expected to moderate fire activity today through <br />
midweek. Another warming and drying period will move in Thursday or Friday. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Safety: The most common cause of injuries in association with wildland firefighting is motor vehicle accidents. <br />
Watch for increased traffic and slower-moving vehicles on roads around closure areas. Avoid pulling out in front <br />
of large vehicles, as they cannot stop or slow down quickly.  <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Hunting: Firefighters may be working in hidden areas. Confirm your target and the surrounding area before you <br />
shoot.  A reminder that no hunting may be conducted in the fire closure area.  If you observe active fire and do <br />
not see firefighters in the immediate area, call 9-1-1.</span>

<br />
Summary:  The Rough Patch Complex and Jack fire are being managed under a full suppression strategy using <br />
direct and indirect tactics to minimize fire spread to prevent loss of valuable resources. The Rough Patch <br />
consists of four fires: Chaos, Little Bend, Buckhead and Near Minky. Increased fire activity was observed across <br />
all fires yesterday.  <br />
<br />
  <br />
<br />
Chaos and Little Bend Fires:  The Chaos fire is at 17,688 acres and the Little Bend fire is at 6,862 acres. Fireline <br />
on the west side of the Chaos fire continues to hold. Yesterday, aircraft assisted with two spots across the road – <br />
the 3828 on the north side of the Chaos and the 3821 road along the southern boundary. Both spots were <br />
estimated at 3-5 acres. Crews will continue working them today, as well as holding and improving the southern <br />
boundary. Burning operations last night worked on completing the last section of direct fire line between Chaos <br />
and Little Bend on the 3821 road. <br />
<br />
  <br />
<br />
Jack and Buckhead Fires:  The Jack fire is at 23,922 acres and the Buckhead fire is at 3,286 acres. The west, <br />
north, and northeast end of the Jack fire has been contained and is being patrolled. Crews are preparing the <br />
2781 road for additional burning operations to bring fire from the Buckhead fire down to the Near Minky. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Near Minky Fire:  The Near Minky fire is at 4,741 acres. This fire is located south of the Jack and Buckhead fires. <br />
The eastern edge and a portion of the western edge have been contained. Northern Rockies Team 1 and the <br />
Florida Red Team continue to work closely together to address concerns with the Smith fire to the south <br />
<br />
  <br />
<br />
Weather:  Cooler weather is in the forecast for this week with temperatures in the 70’s. Northeast winds will be <br />
light, switching to northwest in the afternoon. Expect dense smoke in the lower elevations until the afternoon <br />
when winds shift to the north. <br />
<br />

Yesterday: As expected, the strategy to contain the fire perimeter by implementing a firing operation increased <br />
activity inside the perimeter on the southeast portion of the fire yesterday and smoke was highly visible from <br />
the surrounding areas. However, crews held the perimeter and were able to focus on the methodical work of <br />
containing the fire edge. Crews and engines began mopping up the fire perimeter along Malloy Road down to <br />
Bethel Ridge Road yesterday. Firefighters also continued firing along Forest Road 199 as conditions allowed <br />
on the southwest portion of the fire. When crews were not firing, they were able to hold the fire inside <br />
containment lines to protect the critical commercial infrastructure and private property to the south. <br />
Firefighters and heavy equipment continued building indirect fire line along the southern fire perimeter from <br />
Bethel Ridge on Washington Department of Natural Resources managed lands to the William O. Douglas <br />
wilderness boundary on the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest.<br />
<br />
Today: The National Weather Service has issued a Red Flag Warning for gusty northwest winds and low <br />
relative humidity through 11:00 p.m. on the eastern half of the fire area, although the Incident Meteorologist is <br />
also forecasting higher-than-normal winds for the entire fire area. Several crews and engines that have <br />
completed their structure protection work along Highway 410 north of the fire area will be shifting to assist <br />
firefighters and engines holding and securing fire lines on Bethel Ridge. Aerial resources will be able to assist <br />
in holding and securing containment lines as conditions allow. The construction of indirect containment lines <br />
along Bethel Ridge west to the wilderness boundary continues today. Firefighters and heavy equipment will <br />
continue to work through thick dead and downed timber in the last mile of the planned line construction to <br />
complete the indirect fire line safely and efficiently. Fire activity remains low on the northern perimeter and <br />
engines are continuing to patrol Bumping River Road, Cliffdell, Gold Creek, and the Nile community.<br />
Yakima Valley Emergency Management reduced evacuation levels around the fire as of 8:00 a.m. this <br />
morning.<br />
<br />
Evacuations: LEVEL 2: Bumping River Road from north to south; LEVEL 1: Hwy 410 from Bumping River <br />
Road to U.S. Route 12, and from U.S. 12 at Hwy 410 west to Tieton Reservoir Road. Yakima County Office of <br />

Inchelium, WA – Yesterday, the fire was active on the north and northeast flanks, continuing to back toward <br />
containment lines. A slop over along the northern edge occurred, requiring dozer and air resources working <br />
on containment throughout the day. <br />
<br />
A structure fire also occurred on Hall Creek road just outside of the eastern flank of the fire that spread to a <br />
half-acre in size. Firefighting resources responded and assisted the local fire department with containment.  <br />
<br />
Firefighters worked to secure direct and indirect lines. Mop up and patrol continued around the southeast, <br />
south, and west flanks, with some areas moving into a patrol status.  <br />
<br />
Today, crews will continue to reinforce lines along Hall Creek, on the northern edge of the fire. Firefighters will <br />
continue to improve direct and indirect fire lines, while assessing the need for additional dozer line to close <br />
the gap on the unburnt interior portion of the fire area to the west of Cedar Creek. Patrolling and mopping up <br />
along the rest of the perimeter will continue.  <br />
<br />
On portions of the fire without containment lines, the strategy is to build fire line as close to the fire’s edge as <br />
possible, and to strengthen these lines with small-scale burning where it can be effective. <br />
<br />
The National Guard continues to support the Summit Trail Fire, with crews working on divisions throughout <br />
the fire area.  <br />
<br />
A warming and drying trend is expected today with temperatures near 80 degrees. Tuesday into Wednesday, <br />
a subtle cooling trend is expected with a slight chance of rain.  <br />
<br />
The Colville Reservation has reopened to industrial activities and the general public. <br />
<br />
Prevention Message: Protect your property, friends, and family – prevent wildfires. <br />
<br />
Smoke: Increased fire activity due to drying conditions may result in increased smoke.   <br />

<br />
RED FLAG WARNING in effect today from 1:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. <br />
Yesterday saw an increase in active fire behavior across the fire area including areas around Grouse Mountain, <br />
both Twentyfive Mile and North Fork Twentyfive Mile drainages, and near Slide Peak. Firing operations were <br />
initiated and air resources were deployed to Utah Saddle but after several cycles it was determined that their <br />
impact on the fire spread was minimal, so air operations were suspended. The fire did cross over containment <br />
lines in the northwestern corner and two spot fires were detected in the vicinity of Utah Saddle. Firing operations <br />
also occurred near Slide Peak. The increase in acreage and breach of containment lines has led to a decrease in <br />
the percent containment.  <br />
 <br />
Today a dry front will pass over the fire that will produce very active to extreme behavior; expect large columns of <br />
smoke to be visible from Lake Chelan and the surrounding area. Growth to the west is expected along the <br />
western edge of the fire as well as a north to north westerly push in Utah Saddle between Grouse Mountain and <br />
Dove Point. Firing tactics will be used by crews on the ground as needed to slow, stop and direct the path of the <br />
advancing fire. Along the southern perimeter firing tactics will be used to keep the fire north of road 8410. <br />
Structural protection work will continue along First Creek Road and South Lakeshore Road. Forecast winds <br />
today will limit the availability of air resources.  <br />
 <br />
Fields Point Landing is open to the public for ferry parking, pick up and drop off. Fire support operations are <br />
ongoing at Fields Point. Members of the public are reminded to yield to fire traffic and to stay in areas clearly <br />
marked for public use.  <br />
 <br />
Rotor and fixed-wing air resources will continue to be available to support ground crews.  Aircraft may use local <br />
bodies of water, including Lake Chelan. Recreational boaters should be aware of aircraft takeoff and landings <br />
and keep a safe distance. <br />
 <br />
The Twentyfive Mile Fire was first reported at 3:45 p.m. on August 15, 2021. The fire was initially burning on the <br />
south shore of Lake Chelan near Twentyfive Mile Creek and has expanded south and west of the area. The fire <br />
is under joint jurisdiction of the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest, Washington Department of Natural <br />
Resources, Bureau of Land Management and Chelan County Fire District 7. <br />
<br />
 <br />
Weather: Red Flag Warning today from 1:00PM until 9:00PM. Critical fire weather conditions are expected today <br />
as a dry front moves through enhancing westerly winds in the afternoon and early evening. Temperatures will be <br />
slightly cooler and humidity will remain in the low 20’s. <br />
 <br />
Evacuations: The most up-to-date evacuation information is available through Chelan County Emergency <br />
Management. Current evacuation levels remained in place overnight and will continue <br />
throughout the day. The Chelan County Sherriff will update evacuation levels as conditions warrant.</span>

<br />
The Chickadee Creek Fire is located approximately 15 miles west of Tonasket, Washington. The Walker Creek <br />
Fire is located approximately 13 miles east/northeast of Tonasket, Washington, surrounding Lake Bonaparte.<br />
The Incident Command Post at the Omak Stampede Grounds is closed to all but essential personnel to help <br />
ensure the health and safety of community members and firefighters. Temperatures today will be 75 to 80 <br />
degrees, with gusty northerly winds starting this afternoon and continuing tonight.<br />
Operations<br />
Some additional resources arrived yesterday to help offset personnel and equipment that were de-mobilized from <br />
these fires as they timed out on their assignments and returned home to rest and refurbish their equipment.<br />
Walker Creek Fire<br />
Firefighters continued to build fire line in the northeastern portion of the fire yesterday and mopped up along the <br />
eastern fire perimeter. Increased temperatures yesterday contributed to some torching of fuels near the southern <br />
fire boundary, and crews worked yesterday afternoon securing several small spot fires that crossed over the fire <br />
line. Heavy helicopters used water bucket drops to minimize fire behavior on these spot fires.<br />
Evacuations<br />
Evacuation levels can be viewed at the Okanogan County Walker Creek and Chickadee Fire web page at <br />
https://tinyurl.com/6dt8kytx.<br />
Closures<br />
Four road closures remain on the Walker Creek Fire: Bonaparte Lake Road, Summer Road, Diamond Belle <br />
Road, and Bunch Road. These closures are located north of Highway 20 and terminate on the Colville National <br />
Forest.<br />
The Colville National Forest area closure remains in effect.</span>
