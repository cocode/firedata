The Big Meadow Fire started on September 9th, 2021. The fire started from a late season lightning storm in the <br />
Dry Mountain area north of Riley, Oregon. The fire is burning in steep rocky terrain with limited firefighter access.<br />
<br />
Control objectives are to keep the south of Upper Valley Road, west of Egypt Well, north of Big Ridge and east of <br />
private property and the land protected by the Silver Creek Rangeland Fire Protection Association and Oregon <br />
Department of Forestry.<br />
<br />
Today, firefighters will continue with reinforcing the fire perimeter that was constructed by the Type 3 Team. <br />
Operations will look to secure lines ahead of the forecasted dry front and associated winds. Crews will also work <br />
to bring water to the fireline as some areas can’t be accessed by engines due to the rocky terrain. This will mean <br />
hiking hoses into the fire footprint.<br />
<br />
Crews will continue to grid within the fire area for hot spots and continue mop up operations. There were a <br />
couple of hot spots outside of the fireline that crews will work to secure and mop up.<br />
<br />
Air operations will continue to support the firefighters as needed. A type one helicopter is assigned to the fire as <br />
well as a type 3 helicopter to help provide crews with a bird's eye view of what the fire is doing.<br />
<br />
Weather: Another warm day is forecasted with temperatures to the mid to upper 70’s and low relative humidity. A <br />
dry cold front will start to move into the area starting today which will bring high northwest winds with ridgetop <br />
gusts predicted at 20-25mph. There is moisture predicted to enter the area starting Friday going into Saturday.<br />
<br />
Smoke: There may be smoke in the area due to the elevated winds.<br />
<br />
Hunting Season: It’s September and that means it’s also hunting season. We are asking the public to be aware <br />
of the elevated hunting and fire traffic in the area.<br />
<br />
Closures: There are closures in place around the fire area. These closures are on Bureau of Land Management <br />
lands and Forest Service lands. Please adhere to these closures for firefighter and public safety.<br />
<br />
Prevention Message: Safety is our number one priority. Please continue to do all you can to prevent wildfires.</span>

Current Status: The fire continued to be active yesterday in the Upper Dickey Creek, Mother Lode Creek, and <br />
Battle drainages due to warm and dry conditions. An afternoon flight observed intense ground fire and some <br />
group tree torching. Due to wind conditions at the water dip locations, helicopters were not able to be used for <br />
bucket drops. Equipment and crews prepared primary and contingency lines on road systems and hand lines <br />
north and northwest of the fire as part of the long-term fire suppression strategy. An estimated 23 miles of <br />
primary line along roads has been completed and an estimated 21 miles remain to be completed. Fire crews <br />
patrolled the northeast corner and containment line searching for any hot spots or heat that could threaten the <br />
line. Engines patrolled and mopped up on the eastern side along Forest Road 6350 to keep the line secured. On <br />
the south side firefighters patrolled containment lines and crews chipped brush and slash from preparation work <br />
done along the road system. Fire crews mopped up along Forest Road 4696 where tactical firing actions were <br />
completed several days ago.  <br />
<br />
Planned Actions: Moderate fire activity expected today with mostly creeping, smoldering, and occasional group <br />
tree torching. The Upper Dickey Creek, Mother Lode Creek, Pansey Creek, and Battle Creek drainages will <br />
continue to have most of the active fire. Fire movement upslope as well as backing downslopes is expected to <br />
slowly continue in the drainages on the northwestern and western sides of the fire. Heavy equipment will be used <br />
to prepare primary lines on road systems north and northwest of the fire. Existing containment lines will be <br />
strengthened as firefighters watch for any trees or pockets of heat that could threaten the lines. Engine crews will <br />
patrol and monitor containment lines along the eastern and southern sides of the fire. Five helicopters remain <br />
assigned to the fire and will be used for aerial suppression action as wind and weather conditions safely allow. <br />
<br />
Weather: Today’s weather forecast indicates slightly cooler conditions with temperatures 62-70 degrees, <br />
minimum humidity levels from 35% to 45%, and winds out of the west/northwest at 6-12 mph with gusts up to 20 <br />
mph. A weather system is forecasted to bring rain to the fire area beginning on Friday evening and lasting <br />
through Sunday morning. <br />
<br />
Temporary Flight Restriction (TFR): There is a TFR in place for air space over the Bull Complex (FDC 1-2073) to <br />
reduce impacts to fire aviation operations. Fire aviation response is halted or delayed if an unauthorized aircraft <br />
enters the TFR. Temporary flight restrictions also apply to unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) or drones. If you fly, <br />
we can’t! <br />
<br />
Evacuations:  The Marion County Sheriff has issued a Level 1 “Be Ready” evacuation advisory only for <br />
Breitenbush Hot Springs. Residents should be aware of the danger that exists in their area, monitor emergency <br />
services websites and local media, and make an action plan should the evacuation level rise. The advisory can <br />
be viewed at:  https://www.flashalert.net/id/MarionSheriff?alert=1.  <br />
<br />
Closures:  For the safety of wildland firefighters and the public, the National Forests have enacted area closures <br />
that prevent the public from being upon National Forest System lands in the vicinity of the Bull Complex Fire. All <br />
Forest lands that are south and west of Forest Road 46, and east of the Riverside Fire perimeter are closed. The <br />
entire length of Forest Road 46 is closed. Lands within the 2020 Lionshead and Beachie Creek Fire areas are <br />
also closed.  See the closure orders and maps at https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/closures/7773/.</span>

<br />
Cedar Creek, Cub Creek 2, and Delancy Fires September 10, 2021 Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest<br />
<br />
Minimal fire behavior occurred in the Cedar Creek Fire this week, with limited isolated creeping and some <br />
torching in the Varden Creek drainage and near Slate Lake.   On the Cub Creek 2 Fire, some creeping has been <br />
observed around the Farewell and Lake Creek vicinity. No activity was observed on the Delancy Fire. Cooler <br />
temperatures and higher humidities are expected across both fires this weekend, reducing the likelihood of active <br />
fire behavior and smoke production for the next few days.<br />
<br />
Crews and heavy equipment continue to complete suppression repair across both fire areas, repairing firelines, <br />
felling hazard trees along roads, chipping debris, and repairing roads damaged by suppression activity. The <br />
shortage of personnel and equipment nationally, plus the need to prioritize these resources for active fires with <br />
immediate suppression needs, have slowed the progress of this work on the Cedar Creek and Cub Creek 2 fires. <br />
<br />
Closure Area Update:<br />
<br />
In the Cedar Creek Fire area, the existing closure order remains unchanged for the next week. As of September <br />
10, the closure order for the Cub Creek 2 Fire has changed:<br />
<br />
·       Forest Service Roads 51 and 5160 (west of the Chewuch River) from Eightmile Ranch to Andrews Creek <br />
Trailhead are now open.<br />
<br />
·       Andrews Creek Trailhead and all trails leaving from this site are now open, including Andrews Creek, Little <br />
Andrews Creek, Coleman Ridge, and Fire Creek. Past Andrews Creek Trailhead, the road to Thirtymile Trailhead <br />
remains closed to allow for completion of road repair work that was scheduled for July but deferred because of <br />
fire activity. All other roads, trails, and trailheads in the existing closure order remain closed as crews continue to <br />
complete suppression repair and remove hazardous trees.<br />
<br />
·       Camp 4 Campground is now open.<br />
<br />
·       All other campgrounds, dispersed campsites, and trails in the Cub Creek 2 Fire closure area remain closed, <br />
including Falls Creek and Chewuch Campgrounds and the trail to Falls Creek Falls.<br />
<br />
Visit USFS Pacific Northwest Region Emergency Closures for locations and details of current closures. Fire <br />
closure orders and maps are also available here. As more suppression repair work is completed over the next <br />
week, district staff will re-assess the extent of closure orders across both fires to look for more opportunities to <br />
open areas and trails. Meanwhile, we appreciate your patience and respect for these closures to ensure the <br />
safety of our firefighters and visitors.<br />
<br />

Lakeview Ore. – The Office of the Oregon State Fire Marshal Incident Management Team (OSFM) and task <br />
forces will be traveling back to their home agencies today. OSFM would like to thank all of the local agencies and <br />
firefighters for the hard work during the initial attack and the ongoing support during the incident. Undoubtedly, <br />
the quick and heroic actions of firefighters and local law enforcement saved many lives and protected many <br />
homes in the path of the Cougar Peak Fire. During the three deployments that brought OSFM to Lake County <br />
this year, the community has been welcoming and the Teams thank them for their hospitality. OSFM is grateful to <br />
Northwest Incident Management Team 8 for the partnership and ongoing efforts to continue to manage the fire. <br />
<br />
Yesterday’s conditions over the fire allowed for many successful planned operations. This included the burnout <br />
south of Cox Flat on the southwest corner of the fire. The heavy equipment group continued to make progress <br />
constructing contingency lines on the western side of the fire. The burnout completed two days before at Round <br />
Mountain had crews mopping up and patrolling. The northern tip of the fire has been cold trailed and very little <br />
heat was found. Starting on the northeast corner down the eastern edge of the fire, firefighters are working <br />
tirelessly to continue installing hose lays and using helicopters to keep the hotspots and spots found outside the <br />
line in check. The southeast corner of the fire is now mopped in up to 100-150 feet and crews continue to mop-<br />
up and patrol this crucial anchor point on the fire. <br />
<br />
Today, firefighter’s priorities will be working the large amount of heat remaining on the eastern side of the fire. <br />
Some areas are in difficult terrain and hiking into the fires edge is an arduous task. Air attack will be available <br />
over the fire, helping prioritize and coordinate air resources bringing needed water into ground resources via <br />
bucket drops. Firefighters did find spots close to the fire line throughout the afternoon yesterday, as downslope <br />
winds pushed embers over the line. All resources remain aware to report cattle in the fire area, with location, ear <br />
tag and photos to the incident management team. This information will continue to be reported to the livestock <br />
owners. <br />
<br />
Mop-up and patrol will be the mission for crews along the south, southwest, and northern edges of the fire. <br />
Heavy equipment will continue to construct contingency lines along the western side. Scouting of the western <br />
edge continues, as fire managers are looking for opportunities to construct the lines closer to the fire’s edge. As <br />
weather and conditions on the ground allow, fire managers are prepared to conduct small burnout operations to <br />
reduce unburned fuels between the fire’s edge and control lines.  <br />
<br />
Behavior: Overnight minimal fire activity was reported. Today, the relative humidity will again dip into the single <br />
digits with 10-15% predicted to be the average across the fire area. The dry air mass in place did not allow for <br />
great humidity recovery overnight, which again today is resulting in critically low relative humidity. This may <br />
increase fire activity and smoke from the Cougar Peak Fire.</span>

Cedar Creek, Cub Creek 2, and Delancy Fires September 10, 2021 Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest<br />
<br />
Minimal fire behavior occurred in the Cedar Creek Fire this week, with limited isolated creeping and some <br />
torching in the Varden Creek drainage and near Slate Lake.   On the Cub Creek 2 Fire, some creeping has been <br />
observed around the Farewell and Lake Creek vicinity. No activity was observed on the Delancy Fire. Cooler <br />
temperatures and higher humidities are expected across both fires this weekend, reducing the likelihood of active <br />
fire behavior and smoke production for the next few days.<br />
<br />
Crews and heavy equipment continue to complete suppression repair across both fire areas, repairing firelines, <br />
felling hazard trees along roads, chipping debris, and repairing roads damaged by suppression activity. The <br />
shortage of personnel and equipment nationally, plus the need to prioritize these resources for active fires with <br />
immediate suppression needs, have slowed the progress of this work on the Cedar Creek and Cub Creek 2 fires. <br />
<br />
Closure Area Update:<br />
<br />
In the Cedar Creek Fire area, the existing closure order remains unchanged for the next week. As of September <br />
10, the closure order for the Cub Creek 2 Fire has changed:<br />
<br />
·       Forest Service Roads 51 and 5160 (west of the Chewuch River) from Eightmile Ranch to Andrews Creek <br />
Trailhead are now open.<br />
<br />
·       Andrews Creek Trailhead and all trails leaving from this site are now open, including Andrews Creek, Little <br />
Andrews Creek, Coleman Ridge, and Fire Creek. Past Andrews Creek Trailhead, the road to Thirtymile Trailhead <br />
remains closed to allow for completion of road repair work that was scheduled for July but deferred because of <br />
fire activity. All other roads, trails, and trailheads in the existing closure order remain closed as crews continue to <br />
complete suppression repair and remove hazardous trees.<br />
<br />
·       Camp 4 Campground is now open.<br />
<br />
·       All other campgrounds, dispersed campsites, and trails in the Cub Creek 2 Fire closure area remain closed, <br />
including Falls Creek and Chewuch Campgrounds and the trail to Falls Creek Falls.<br />
<br />
Visit USFS Pacific Northwest Region Emergency Closures for locations and details of current closures. Fire <br />
closure orders and maps are also available here. As more suppression repair work is completed over the next <br />
week, district staff will re-assess the extent of closure orders across both fires to look for more opportunities to <br />
open areas and trails. Meanwhile, we appreciate your patience and respect for these closures to ensure the <br />
safety of our firefighters and visitors.<br />
<br />
For fire-related questions or information, please contact the Methow Valley Ranger District during business hours <br />
at 509-996-4000.</span>

Current Situation:  <br />
<br />
Yesterday, limited fire behavior allowed resources to continue work directly on the fire perimeter. Heavy <br />
equipment made advances closing the gap to complete indirect line in Division A.  Crews and engines worked in <br />
Division H of the Big Hamlin Fire to extinguish any remaining heat and check for spot fires from burnout <br />
operations of several days ago. Similar “search and destroy” heat missions were carried out across other <br />
divisions and around other values at risk to ensure perimeters remained secure. Several hand crews were <br />
moved from Branch I to Branch II to establish area awareness and plan firing operations should they be needed <br />
in the days ahead. Aviation supplied important assistance to firefighters both in bucket work and reconnaissance. <br />
<br />
With fire activity less than expected, fire managers took the opportunity to send firefighting resources and a <br />
helicopter to assess the previously contained fires that originated as part of the Devil’s Knob Complex from <br />
lightning 6 weeks ago. Aerial inspection revealed a pocket of fuel burning in the interior of the Wild Cat Fire but <br />
confirmed the security of all fires’ firelines. Suppression repair for firelines of the Dismal Creek, Little Applegate, <br />
Mule Creek, Section 30 (Railroad), and Wild Cat fires will be planned and completed soon.       <br />
<br />
Today, humidity will be higher in the 35-45% range and temperature in the low 70s due to a marine influenced <br />
weather pattern. Firefighters will take advantage of this weather and continue the diligent hard work that is <br />
building toward further extension and strengthening of firelines to achieve increased containment. Divisions B <br />
and C of the Smith Fire and Division H of the Big Hamlin remain a high priority.  <br />
<br />
Evacuation Notices: <br />
<br />
The Ash Creek-South Umpqua Road remains at a Level 3: Go (Leave immediately). As of 8 am on September <br />
11, Dumont 2810 to Jackson Creek was reduced to Level 1: Be Ready. The interactive web mapdepicts <br />
evacuation areas and levels: https://dcor.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?<br />

Incident Summary:   <br />
<br />
Yesterday’s warm and dry air resulted in increased fire activity; however, there was limited uncontrolled fire <br />
growth on the Complex.  Fire personnel took advantage of favorable conditions to successfully conduct <br />
controlled firing operations on the northeast side of the fire area. These operations removed unburnt fuel in <br />
challenging sections of the Chaos and Little Bend fires. This work will significantly increase the probability of <br />
securing these areas in the coming days. Firefighters and support crews in all areas of the Complex will continue <br />
working to contain fires utilizing a full suppression strategy. <br />
<br />
Chaos and Little Bend Fires:   <br />
<br />
The Chaos Fire is 26284 acres, and the Little Bend Creek Fire is 9087 acres. The northern tip of the Chaos fire <br />
that crossed the 2460 road near Fairfield Peak did not show significant heat or smoke today.  Crews conducted <br />
firing operations and connected the fireline between the 3829 road and 2640 roads.  Firefighters utilized direct <br />
and indirect tactics to construct line between Horse Heaven Creek and the 3829 road. This line will help limit <br />
northerly fire grown in this drainage.   Fireline was constructed between the 3818 and 310 roads to help secure <br />
the east side of the Little Bend fire.  Firefighters developed a plan to remove hazardous snags on the southeast <br />
corner of the Little Bend fire by using explosives to safely remove hazard trees that cannot be safely removed <br />
with chainsaws or mechanical equipment. <br />
<br />
Jack and Buckhead Fires:   <br />
<br />
The Jack Fire is 24165 acres, and the Buckhead Fire is 6925 acres.  Containment lines are holding on the west, <br />
north, and northeast perimeters, and work focus is shifting to fireline rehabilitation and repair.  Today, fire crews <br />
will patrol containment lines to discover and eliminate any previously undetected areas of heat revealed with <br />
today's warm weather.  <br />
<br />
Near Minky Fire:   <br />
<br />
The Near Minky Fire is at 4,869 acres. All containment lines are holding well, and there was no significant fire <br />
activity today. If conditions allow, crews will conduct a small firing operation to secure a section of line on the east <br />
side of the fire. The Rocky Mountain Incident Management Team on the Devil’s Knob Complex is coordinating <br />
with the Great Basin Incident Management Team 2 to manage impacts from the nearby Smith fire.   <br />
<br />
Closures:   <br />
<br />
Copies of all closures and maps can be found at https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/closures/7758/. <br />
<br />

<br />
Fire activity picked up yesterday with the warmer and drier weather, but fire movement and spread was minimal. <br />
Firefighters took advantage of favorable weather conditions to resume strategic firing of unburned fuel inside the <br />
fireline in Division P and Division T in the SW portion of the fire. Aerial ignition utilizing a UAS (Drone) and hand <br />
firing were used to accomplish the objective of removing material that may burn in the future and threaten <br />
constructed firelines.  <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Today, crews will be working to improve indirect lines and scout for opportunities to go direct. Firefighters will <br />
continue constructing direct lines from the area near Helispot-13, close to the intersection of roads 1925 and <br />
1912 at the Division P, Division T break. Crews will chip, move and haul slash material to clean existing firelines, <br />
remove debris from culverts and construct water bars on dozer lines in preparation for rain that is forecasted <br />
towards the end of the week. Additional firing operations may be conducted in the NE portion of the fire to <br />
remove pockets of unburned vegetation. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Weather: A cool, dry frontal passage came through overnight bringing slightly cooler temperatures, higher <br />
humidity and cloudier skies today. High temperature will be 65 to 70 degrees, relative humidity 35-45% and <br />
winds from the Northwest at 10 to 13 mph. At this morning’s briefing, Incident Meteorologist Dave Schallenberger <br />
reported that “We’re still on track to receive substantial rainfall on the fire on Friday, Saturday and Sunday.”  <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Smoke: Air quality should be 'Good' to “Moderate” today for most of the Outlook area. Northwest wind could be <br />
putting some smoke into Bend and La Pine. Smoke from other large fires in Oregon and California should stay to <br />
our south. See https://oregonsmoke.blogspot.com/  or  https://fire.airnow.gov/ for more information. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Safety: Firefighters and hunters may be sharing portions of the same roads. Please use caution while driving and <br />
observe all closures in place for the safety of the public and firefighters. <br />
<br />
  <br />
<br />
Closures: Roads 24, 19 and 18 remain closed in the area. Please visit <br />
https://www.fs.usda.gov/alerts/willamette/alerts-notices for information on additional closures and maps.</span>

The Muckamuck fire has been a long process and the team is preparing to turn it over to a smaller organizational <br />
structure. There has been lots of preparation in the background to make sure the right resources are left on the <br />
fire. Crews on the line have finished their mop up operations and are now focused on repair work and patrolling <br />
the fires perimeter. This is customary to make sure the fire has a great containment line and ready to turn back to <br />
local agencies. Additional repair work and repairing handlines will continue today.     <br />
<br />
Weather today is expected to be mostly sunny with a max temperature 56 degrees at the peaks with 30% <br />
humidity. Northwest winds 6-10 with gusts to 20 mph on the ridgetops in the afternoon. Temperatures overnight <br />
are dropping into the 30s.   <br />
<br />
Current road closures remain in effect and are being looked at on a regular basis.  For the most up to date <br />

Incident Summary:   <br />
<br />
Yesterday’s warm and dry air resulted in increased fire activity; however, there was limited uncontrolled fire <br />
growth on the Complex.  Fire personnel took advantage of favorable conditions to successfully conduct <br />
controlled firing operations on the northeast side of the fire area. These operations removed unburnt fuel in <br />
challenging sections of the Chaos and Little Bend fires. This work will significantly increase the probability of <br />
securing these areas in the coming days. Firefighters and support crews in all areas of the Complex will continue <br />
working to contain fires utilizing a full suppression strategy. <br />
<br />
Chaos and Little Bend Fires:   <br />
<br />
The Chaos Fire is 26284 acres, and the Little Bend Creek Fire is 9087 acres. The northern tip of the Chaos fire <br />
that crossed the 2460 road near Fairfield Peak did not show significant heat or smoke today.  Crews conducted <br />
firing operations and connected the fireline between the 3829 road and 2640 roads.  Firefighters utilized direct <br />
and indirect tactics to construct line between Horse Heaven Creek and the 3829 road. This line will help limit <br />
northerly fire grown in this drainage.   Fireline was constructed between the 3818 and 310 roads to help secure <br />
the east side of the Little Bend fire.  Firefighters developed a plan to remove hazardous snags on the southeast <br />
corner of the Little Bend fire by using explosives to safely remove hazard trees that cannot be safely removed <br />
with chainsaws or mechanical equipment. <br />
<br />
Jack and Buckhead Fires:   <br />
<br />
The Jack Fire is 24165 acres, and the Buckhead Fire is 6925 acres.  Containment lines are holding on the west, <br />
north, and northeast perimeters, and work focus is shifting to fireline rehabilitation and repair.  Today, fire crews <br />
will patrol containment lines to discover and eliminate any previously undetected areas of heat revealed with <br />
today's warm weather.  <br />
<br />
Near Minky Fire:   <br />
<br />
The Near Minky Fire is at 4,869 acres. All containment lines are holding well, and there was no significant fire <br />
activity today. If conditions allow, crews will conduct a small firing operation to secure a section of line on the east <br />
side of the fire. The Rocky Mountain Incident Management Team on the Devil’s Knob Complex is coordinating <br />
with the Great Basin Incident Management Team 2 to manage impacts from the nearby Smith fire.   <br />
<br />
Closures:   <br />
<br />
Copies of all closures and maps can be found at https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/closures/7758/. <br />
<br />

communities in and around Cliffdell, Goose Prairie, and Bumping Lake. Firefighters completed a hose lay along <br />
the new north/south fireline (about one and a half miles northwest of Cliffdell) and began firing operations to keep <br />
active fire from moving west. Crews successfully completed firing operations along the east/west portion of <br />
Forest Road (FR) 1706 to limit active fire from moving north in that area. Firefighters began scouting <br />
opportunities for direct fireline from the furthest western point of Forest Road 1706 northwest toward American <br />
Ridge. Crews completed structure protection preparations in the Goose Prairie, Bumping Lake, Bumping River <br />
Road, and north/south portion of Highway 410 corridor areas. As expected, fire continued backing downslope on <br />
the western flank toward the Bumping River and on the northern flank at American Ridge. Repair work continued <br />
with heavy equipment and personnel working road systems north of Rimrock Lake, Bethel Ridge, and Nile Road.<br />
 <br />
Today: Strong valley and ridgetop winds are predicted with gusts up to 30 mph. Moderate fire behavior is <br />
expected near Edgar Rock, the American Ridge, and Goose Prairie, with potential for increased fire activity when <br />
winds align with unburned fuels. Structure protection crews will remain vigilant in communities near the <br />
north/south area of the Highway 410 corridor, Goose Prairie, Bumping Lake, and Bumping River Road. <br />
Continued firing operations on the new fire line northwest of Cliffdell will depend on weather conditions. <br />
Suppression repairs (e.g. road grading, naturalizing dozer lines that are no longer needed, installing water bars) <br />
continue throughout contained areas of the fire.</span>

<br />
The Summit Trail Fire Information phone number, email address, and InciWeb page will no longer be active after <br />
8 p.m. tonight. Any future fire information will be posted on the Mt. Tolman Fire Center Facebook page at <br />
https://www.facebook.com/Mt-Tolman-Fire-Center-1049496928435678. <br />
<br />
At 7:00 a.m. on Wednesday, September 15, the Southwest Area Type 2 Incident Management Team 4 will <br />
transfer command of the Summit Trail Fire to a local Type 3 organization, led by Incident Commander Lonny <br />
Cawston. This is the final update from the Type 2 Incident Management Team. Team 4 extends its sincere thanks <br />
to the local communities for their support and hospitality throughout this incident. Due to successful firefighting <br />
efforts, the Summit Trail Fire is now 85% contained, and resources are either demobilizing to return to their home <br />
units or reassigning to assist other wildfires across the country. <br />
<br />
Operations: Firefighters are achieving success along the northern portion of the fire, increasing the depth of <br />
existing containment lines by 100 feet and extending containment on both sides. Crews will continue to pull <br />
pumps, tanks, and hoses from this area until all property is accounted for. On the northeastern flank of the fire, <br />
crews are searching on foot for any remaining heat along existing handlines. On the southern side of Hall Creek <br />
near Bear Springs, vegetation continues to smolder in a few isolated areas, although the northern section is now <br />
secured. Although some sections of fireline remain open, natural features such as wet drainages and marshes <br />
are acting as natural holding features to prevent fire spread. Interior portions of Brush Mountain continue to <br />
produce light smoke, but no flames have been detected. Crews are working across the fire area to backhaul <br />
excess equipment and return it to identified staging areas. The Suppression Repair Group is grading Hall Creek <br />
Road north of Inchelium as timber is hauled to the mills in the surrounding communities. Air resources remain <br />
available and ready to respond if the need arises.<br />
 <br />
Weather: Today will be mostly sunny and rain-free with seasonably mild temperatures. A weak cold front will <br />
move through on Wednesday, resulting in a few more clouds and breezy winds in the afternoon. Thursday will be <br />
the last rain-free and mild day of the week with light rain and cooler temperatures expected Friday through <br />
Sunday.<br />
 <br />
Safety: The health and safety of firefighters and the public is the first priority. The public is strongly encouraged to <br />
stay safely clear of the active fire area. Firefighters are conducting operations under protocols to mitigate the risk <br />
of COVID-19.  <br />
 <br />
Smoke: Smoke from surrounding fires may be visible in the area surrounding Inchelium. An interactive smoke <br />
map at https://wasmoke.blogspot.com/ allows you to zoom into your location to see the latest smoke information. <br />
Smoke-sensitive individuals and people with respiratory problems or heart disease are encouraged to take <br />
precautionary measures.</span>

<br />
Management of the Twentyfive Mile Fire transferred to Southwest Incident Command Team 3 at 6:00 am this <br />
morning.<br />
<br />
Yesterday: Ahead of the anticipated weather pattern change, firefighters continued to strengthen the containment <br />
line west of the fire. Using both hand and aerial ignition, crews worked to complete firing along the southwest <br />
perimeter of the fire. Mop up continued in the Slide Peak area and elsewhere on the fire as crews continue <br />
checking for and extinguishing any hot spots. In areas where there has been no recent heat detected they <br />
continued to backhaul equipment so that it can be refurbished and made available for use where needed.<br />
<br />
Today: Over the next few shifts resources will be working to secure lines and evaluate opportunities to conduct <br />
aerial ignitions to increase depth of the containment lines. Road crews will continue the progress on road repairs <br />
to ensure safe access for fire personnel. Aerial ignition may occur in the interior of the fire area to improve the <br />
depth of the containment lines and limit tree mortality from uphill fire progression.<br />
<br />
Weather and Fire Behavior: A cold front is expected today that will bring a weather pattern change through this <br />
weekend. Temperatures will be in the 50s to mid-60s under a partly sunny sky. Thursday will have cloud cover <br />
with little to no precipitation and slightly cooler temperatures. There is a high chance for precipitation Friday into <br />
Saturday along with unseasonably cold temperatures and increased relative humidity.<br />
Because of the weather diminished fire behavior is expected. There is potential for moderate fire behavior in <br />
unburned pockets of fuel. Heavy fuels will remain dry in the coming week and the fire will likely continue to burn <br />
though “islands” of green trees interior to the containment lines, producing visible smoke.</span>

<br />
Tonasket, WA:  Yesterday, wildland engines patrolled the fire perimeter, engaging in any remaining hot spots <br />
along the fire line or around structures.  Operations continues to shift and focus on rehabilitation of dozer lines <br />
and fire suppression damage. Excavators have been working on dozer lines between Diamond Bell Road, Bunch <br />
Road, and up to Fox Road.  Additionally, hand crews have been evaluating hand trails for mitigation as well as <br />
work on sensitive areas of dozer repairs, such as lines surrounding historic cabins. Crews are working with <br />
chippers to remove concentrated fuels created during initial attack. A BAER (burned area emergency response) <br />
team is evaluation conditions on the fire and recommending mitigation measures to reduce erosions and <br />
promote recovery of the ecosystem.<br />
<br />
Today, crews will continue on patrol along the fire line, searching for hot spots.  Rehabilitation work will continue <br />
in the Diamond Bell, Bunch Creek and Fox Creek road.  An excavator will be working along Bunch Creek road, <br />
residences utilizing this route should use caution.  The northwest flank of Bonaparte Mountain will continue to <br />
consume fuels and produce scattered smoke along the fire edge.  Crews will continue to monitor this area for <br />
changes in fire behavior. <br />
<br />
Dry, windy conditions will be present into the evening and temperatures will start to reduce throughout the night.  <br />
Wetting rains are looking fairly confident for late this week and throughout the weekend.<br />
<br />
Road closures and level 1 evacuations are still in effect for the fire area.  Law enforcement officers continue to <br />
patrol the closed roads.</span>
