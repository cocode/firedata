Late season wildfire reaches 2,600 acres<br />
<br />
Wildfire season isn’t over yet. On Thursday, September 9, Harney County received abundant late afternoon and <br />
evening lightning, and two positive strikes in the Dry Mountain area north of Riley sparked separate wildfires with <br />
surprising acreage for this time of year. Quick response from the Silver Creek Rangeland Fire Protection <br />
Association, Burns Interagency Fire Zone and private contractors kept the Silver Creek fire at 86 acres before <br />
being fully contained on September 11. The Big Meadow fire, burning in heavy timber, with limited ground access <br />
due to rocky and rough terrain, is still active at 2,600 acres and only 15 percent contained.<br />
<br />
Once smoke and weather conditions improved on Friday, September 10, a multitude of air resources were able <br />
to fly and provide significant suppression support at Big Meadow. Very Large Air Tankers (8,000-gallon capacity), <br />
Large Air Tankers (2,000 to 4,000-gallon capacity), Single Engine Air Tankers (800-gallon capacity), a Type 3 <br />
Helicopter (180-gallon capacity, and passenger space) and a Type 1 Blackhawk Helicopter (up to 3,000-gallon <br />
capacity) – along with Air Attack planes who coordinate and lead these resources from the air – have all been on <br />
site, dropping water or retardant to slow fire spread and drown active hot spots.<br />
<br />
Air resources are expected to be on scene throughout the week. Ground crews will continue securing control <br />
lines and mop-up from the perimeter as containment improves. Type 2 Northwest Interagency Incident <br />
Management Team 7 assumed control of the Big Meadow fire and assigned staff and equipment on Monday, <br />
September 13. Their Incident Command Post and the firefighter base camp are set up in Riley for the duration. <br />
Incident management teams provide a command-and-control infrastructure to take care of the operational, <br />
logistical, informational, planning, fiscal, community, political, and safety issues associated with complex <br />
incidents, essentially allowing local officials to return to normal work.<br />
<br />
A closure of both Bureau of Land Management and U.S. Forest Service-administered public lands in the Big <br />
Meadow fire area is in place. Roads and trails within the closure are off limits to all access – hiking, biking, <br />
horseback, ATV, vehicle, etc. – until further notice. Boundary roads along the closure remain open. Maps of the <br />
closure area are available at the BLM office at 28910 Highway 20 West in Hines, the Riley Store, and Harney <br />
County Sporting Goods, and posted at entry roads in the fire vicinity.<br />
<br />
Remember! Wildfire danger still exists! Public use restrictions are still in place – no campfires, personal chainsaw <br />
use, explosives, or parking or driving off road.<br />
<br />

Zone on social media or give us a call at (541) 573-4400.</span>

Current Status: Yesterday, the fire continued to be moderately active in the Upper Dickey Creek, Mother Lode <br />
Creek, and Battle drainages. Helicopter bucket water drops were used to slow fire spread in these areas on the <br />
northwest corner of the fire. On the south side the fire slowly backed downslope in the Elk Lake Creek and East <br />
Humbug Creek drainages. Firefighters monitored the fire movement and tested the tanks, pumps, and hose lines <br />
which are set up on the primary line as well as mopped up along Forest Road 4696 where tactical firing was <br />
done several days ago to keep fire intensity subdued. Crews patrolled the southeast corner and patrolled and <br />
mopped up the containment line along the eastern side of the fire. Fire crews patrolled the northeast corner and <br />
the containment line moving to the west and searching for any hot spots or heat that could threaten the line. <br />
Although it is not currently threatened by fire, sprinkler systems with pumps and hoses were installed as part of a <br />
structure protection plan for the Bagby Hot Springs area. Crews and equipment prepared primary and <br />
contingency lines on road systems and hand lines north and northwest of the fire as part of the long-term fire <br />
suppression strategy. This work is being done along an estimated 40 miles of forest roads. <br />
<br />
Planned Actions: Forest conditions continue to be extremely dry which will allow occasional surface fire, some <br />
group tree torching, smoldering, and creeping fire movement. Fire movement upslope as well as backing <br />
downslopes is expected to slowly continue in the drainages on the northwestern and western sides of the fire. <br />
The Upper Dickey Creek, Mother Lode Creek, Pansey Creek, and Battle Creek drainages will continue to have <br />
most of this fire activity. Engine crews will patrol and monitor containment lines along the south and east sides of <br />
the fire. Crews and heavy equipment will be used to prepare primary lines on road systems north and northwest <br />
of the fire. Existing containment lines will be strengthened as firefighters watch for any trees or pockets of heat <br />
that could threaten the lines. Five helicopters remain assigned to the fire and will be used for aerial suppression <br />
action. <br />
<br />
Weather: The weather forecast outlines continued warm and dry conditions with temperatures 70-80 degrees, <br />
minimum humidity levels from 25% to 35%, and winds out of the west/northwest at 4-7 mph. <br />
<br />
Temporary Flight Restriction (TFR): There is a TFR in place for air space over the Bull Complex (FDC 1-2073) to <br />
reduce impacts to fire aviation operations. Fire aviation response is halted or delayed if an unauthorized aircraft <br />
enters the TFR. Temporary flight restrictions also apply to unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) or drones. If you fly, <br />
we can’t! <br />
<br />
Evacuations:  The Marion County Sheriff has issued a Level 1 “Be Ready” evacuation advisory only for <br />
Breitenbush Hot Springs. Residents should be aware of the danger that exists in their area, monitor emergency <br />
services websites and local media, and make an action plan should the evacuation level rise. The advisory can <br />
be viewed at:  https://www.flashalert.net/id/MarionSheriff?alert=1.  <br />
<br />
Closures:  For the safety of wildland firefighters and the public, the National Forests have enacted area closures <br />
that prevent the public from being upon National Forest System lands in the vicinity of the Bull Complex Fire. All <br />
Forest lands that are south and west of Forest Road 46, and east of the Riverside Fire perimeter are closed. The <br />
entire length of Forest Road 46 is closed. Lands within the 2020 Lionshead and Beachie Creek Fire areas are <br />
also closed.  See the closure orders and maps at https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/closures/7773/.</span>

<br />
Cedar Creek, Cub Creek 2, and Delancy Fires September 10, 2021 Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest<br />
<br />
Minimal fire behavior occurred in the Cedar Creek Fire this week, with limited isolated creeping and some <br />
torching in the Varden Creek drainage and near Slate Lake.   On the Cub Creek 2 Fire, some creeping has been <br />
observed around the Farewell and Lake Creek vicinity. No activity was observed on the Delancy Fire. Cooler <br />
temperatures and higher humidities are expected across both fires this weekend, reducing the likelihood of active <br />
fire behavior and smoke production for the next few days.<br />
<br />
Crews and heavy equipment continue to complete suppression repair across both fire areas, repairing firelines, <br />
felling hazard trees along roads, chipping debris, and repairing roads damaged by suppression activity. The <br />
shortage of personnel and equipment nationally, plus the need to prioritize these resources for active fires with <br />
immediate suppression needs, have slowed the progress of this work on the Cedar Creek and Cub Creek 2 fires. <br />
<br />
Closure Area Update:<br />
<br />
In the Cedar Creek Fire area, the existing closure order remains unchanged for the next week. As of September <br />
10, the closure order for the Cub Creek 2 Fire has changed:<br />
<br />
·       Forest Service Roads 51 and 5160 (west of the Chewuch River) from Eightmile Ranch to Andrews Creek <br />
Trailhead are now open.<br />
<br />
·       Andrews Creek Trailhead and all trails leaving from this site are now open, including Andrews Creek, Little <br />
Andrews Creek, Coleman Ridge, and Fire Creek. Past Andrews Creek Trailhead, the road to Thirtymile Trailhead <br />
remains closed to allow for completion of road repair work that was scheduled for July but deferred because of <br />
fire activity. All other roads, trails, and trailheads in the existing closure order remain closed as crews continue to <br />
complete suppression repair and remove hazardous trees.<br />
<br />
·       Camp 4 Campground is now open.<br />
<br />
·       All other campgrounds, dispersed campsites, and trails in the Cub Creek 2 Fire closure area remain closed, <br />
including Falls Creek and Chewuch Campgrounds and the trail to Falls Creek Falls.<br />
<br />
Visit USFS Pacific Northwest Region Emergency Closures for locations and details of current closures. Fire <br />
closure orders and maps are also available here. As more suppression repair work is completed over the next <br />
week, district staff will re-assess the extent of closure orders across both fires to look for more opportunities to <br />
open areas and trails. Meanwhile, we appreciate your patience and respect for these closures to ensure the <br />
safety of our firefighters and visitors.<br />
<br />

Lakeview Ore. – The Cougar Peak Fire is estimated at 86,412 acres and 6% contained. Excellent progress is <br />
being made to secure perimeter lines and cool hot spots. Firefighters have also scouted and created miles of <br />
direct and indirect line while mopping up areas that threaten the existing containment lines. With the <br />
improvement in visibility, all aviation assets assigned to the fire were very active yesterday. A heavy equipment <br />
group continues to make progress around the fire assisting with line construction. A weak cold front has brought <br />
lower humidity to the region will accelerate the drying of fuels and increase fire activity. <br />
<br />
Last night, crews patrolled the fire and worked hotspots found along the fires edge. Today’s priority will again <br />
concentrate on the eastern and southern edges of the fire. Handlines and dozer lines will be constructed to <br />
connect the existing containment lines. Hose lays will continue to help with mop-up efforts. The forecasted <br />
weather for today is expected to be favorable for tactical burning operations to reduce unburned fuel between the <br />
fire edge and the line. Fire managers plan to secure the fire line on the southwest corner of the fire with a <br />
burnout. Clear skies will give ground resources access to all available air assets today to extinguish flare ups and <br />
hot spots throughout the fire.  <br />
<br />
On the west side of the fire, the heavy equipment group will continue to reinforce contingency lines. Due to the <br />
limited availability of logistic support, all resources will continue to report to the Incident Command Post in <br />
Lakeview and there will not be a spike camp set up in Paisley. The burnout operations on Round Mountain are <br />
complete, and crews will continue mop-up in the area. Along the containment line on the southeastern portion of <br />
the fire, mop-up has reached 50-100 feet into the fires edge.  <br />
<br />
OSFM task forces will be helping with mop-up on the north and south sides of the fire. The great work the crews <br />
have accomplished on the fire has secured property and structures, for that reason the existing structure <br />
taskforces and overhead team are expected to demobilize tomorrow morning. Crews across the fire will continue <br />
to report all cattle found in or near the fire perimeter and have created a mapping system to assist livestock <br />
owners in locating their animals.  <br />
<br />
Behavior: An increase in fire behavior is anticipated. The dry air mass is expected to stay in the area through the <br />
week, resulting in critically low relative humidity. This may increase fire activity and increase smoke coming out of <br />
the Cougar Peak Fire.</span>

Cedar Creek, Cub Creek 2, and Delancy Fires September 10, 2021 Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest<br />
<br />
Minimal fire behavior occurred in the Cedar Creek Fire this week, with limited isolated creeping and some <br />
torching in the Varden Creek drainage and near Slate Lake.   On the Cub Creek 2 Fire, some creeping has been <br />
observed around the Farewell and Lake Creek vicinity. No activity was observed on the Delancy Fire. Cooler <br />
temperatures and higher humidities are expected across both fires this weekend, reducing the likelihood of active <br />
fire behavior and smoke production for the next few days.<br />
<br />
Crews and heavy equipment continue to complete suppression repair across both fire areas, repairing firelines, <br />
felling hazard trees along roads, chipping debris, and repairing roads damaged by suppression activity. The <br />
shortage of personnel and equipment nationally, plus the need to prioritize these resources for active fires with <br />
immediate suppression needs, have slowed the progress of this work on the Cedar Creek and Cub Creek 2 fires. <br />
<br />
Closure Area Update:<br />
<br />
In the Cedar Creek Fire area, the existing closure order remains unchanged for the next week. As of September <br />
10, the closure order for the Cub Creek 2 Fire has changed:<br />
<br />
·       Forest Service Roads 51 and 5160 (west of the Chewuch River) from Eightmile Ranch to Andrews Creek <br />
Trailhead are now open.<br />
<br />
·       Andrews Creek Trailhead and all trails leaving from this site are now open, including Andrews Creek, Little <br />
Andrews Creek, Coleman Ridge, and Fire Creek. Past Andrews Creek Trailhead, the road to Thirtymile Trailhead <br />
remains closed to allow for completion of road repair work that was scheduled for July but deferred because of <br />
fire activity. All other roads, trails, and trailheads in the existing closure order remain closed as crews continue to <br />
complete suppression repair and remove hazardous trees.<br />
<br />
·       Camp 4 Campground is now open.<br />
<br />
·       All other campgrounds, dispersed campsites, and trails in the Cub Creek 2 Fire closure area remain closed, <br />
including Falls Creek and Chewuch Campgrounds and the trail to Falls Creek Falls.<br />
<br />
Visit USFS Pacific Northwest Region Emergency Closures for locations and details of current closures. Fire <br />
closure orders and maps are also available here. As more suppression repair work is completed over the next <br />
week, district staff will re-assess the extent of closure orders across both fires to look for more opportunities to <br />
open areas and trails. Meanwhile, we appreciate your patience and respect for these closures to ensure the <br />
safety of our firefighters and visitors.<br />
<br />

<br />
Current Situation:  <br />
Yesterday marks the second day in a row with minimal perimeter growth. Nighttime humidity recovery and mild <br />
weather conditions throughout the day moderated fire activity, allowing firefighters to make good progress. In <br />
Division E of the Smith Fire, the west section of line was contained.  On other divisions, direct and indirect fireline <br />
construction continued, with firing operations occurring in Division H of the Big Hamlin Fire.   <br />
<br />
Today, fire behavior is expected to be much more active due to poor nighttime humidity recovery overnight. <br />
Morning humidity is predominately in the 20-30% range and will drop throughout the day contributing to elevated <br />
fire behavior. By comparison, humidity yesterday morning ranged from 90-100%. When humidity is low, moisture <br />
travels out of grasses and pine needles making them more able to spread fire. The steep terrain and prevalent <br />
dead and down materials continue to be a challenge for firefighters, especially with low humidity and active fire. <br />
Fire behavior today will duplicate activity of last Tuesday; however, due to work of the last week on primary and <br />
secondary firelines, firefighters are prepared. Fire spread is expected in the direction of the Jack Fire and Rough <br />
Patch Complex as the fire is consuming available dead and down fuels within the 2002 Boulder Creek Fire <br />
footprint.  Should spot fires occur, firefighters will engage in suppressing them if it is safe to do so.  Looking <br />
ahead, fire managers are confident in the work that has been accomplished; higher humidity tomorrow and <br />
wetting rain over the weekend will allow firefighters to build on their progress.  <br />
<br />
Evacuation Notices: <br />
The Ash Creek-South Umpqua Road remains at a Level 3: Go (Leave immediately). As of 8 am on September <br />
11, Dumont 2810 to Jackson Creek was reduced to Level 1: Be Ready. The interactive web mapdepicts <br />
evacuation areas and levels: https://dcor.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?<br />

Please, stay clear of firefighting operations and drive safely! The public should watch out for fire crews and <br />
equipment while traveling on forest roads. Some roads remain closed with barriers. Barriers are in place to <br />
protect firefighters and the public, so please respect the closed areas. <br />
<br />
Stay clear of fire-blackened areas for the many unseen hazards that exist, including live green, fire-weakened, <br />
trees which may fall without warning, and scalding hot stump holes.  Please maintain situational awareness of <br />
your surroundings when traveling and hiking in fire-damaged forests. <br />
<br />
Yesterday: Firefighters continued to focus on SW and SE, continued assessments further out, and monitored and <br />
observed remote areas of southern perimeter. Firefighters continued to hold and improve completed lines to the <br />
west, continued to hold and improve completed lines to the south. Firefighters provided continued point <br />

Incident Summary:   <br />
<br />
Warmer and drier air began impacting the fire area yesterday.   Last night’s breezy east winds are forecasted to <br />
transition to north winds today.   These north dry and potentially gusty winds could produce increased surface fire <br />
and isolated single and group tree torching on the northeast side of the Complex where heat and unburned fuel <br />
remains.  On the southern and western sides of the Complex, minimal heat is being observed.  Isolated pockets <br />
of smoldering and creeping fire could occur in some areas today.   Firefighters and support crews in all areas of <br />
the Complex will continue working to contain fires utilizing a full suppression strategy. <br />
<br />
Chaos and Little Bend Fires:   <br />
<br />
The Chaos Fire is 25,392 acres, and the Little Bend Creek Fire is 8,970 acres. The northern tip of the Chaos fire <br />
that crossed the 2460 road near Fairfield Peak stayed in check yesterday. Firefighters are using hand crews and <br />
hose lays to improve containment in this area.  If favorable burning conditions allow, and if the situation warrants, <br />
crews will conduct limited firing operations west of the 3829 road to limit eastward growth.   Firefighters will work <br />
to slow the northward growth along the 3929-road fire’s edge in the Horse Heaven Creek drainage.  Yesterday, <br />
aerial bucket drops along the southeast corner of Little Bend helped hold fire in place. This helicopter work <br />
allowed crews to improve containment lines on old road networks in this area.   Crews will continue these <br />
containment efforts today. <br />
<br />
Jack and Buckhead Fires:   <br />
<br />
The Jack Fire is 24165 acres, and the Buckhead Fire is 6,861 acres. Today's winds and dry air are not expected <br />
to increase fire behavior beyond smoldering in isolated pockets.  Containment lines are holding on the west, <br />
north, and northeast perimeters. In the southeast corner of the Buckhead, fire growth has been limited through <br />
direct and indirect fire line work along road systems. Fire crews will continue to strengthen these containment <br />
lines as needed.  <br />
<br />
Near Minky Fire:   <br />
<br />
The Near Minky Fire is at 4,869 acres. This stable, southern-most fire will prevent the eastward spread of the <br />
Smith Fire as it continues to move closer to the Near Minky perimeter. The Rocky Mountain Incident <br />
Management Team on the Devil’s Knob Complex will work to contain the Smith Fire on the western portion of the <br />
Near Minky and Buckhead Fires. This work being closely coordinated with the Great Basin Incident Management <br />
Team 2.   <br />
<br />

The UAS (drone) was utilized yesterday and was successful in locating, mapping and estimating sizes of the <br />
spot fires in Nehi Creek. There are three spots, outside the main body of fire but within the primary lines; one <br />
approximately 25 acres, another approximately 20 acres and one approximately 3-5 acres. The 3-5 acre spot is <br />
on the east side of the creek. The UAS was unable to deploy the plastic spheres, as planned to fire a pocket of <br />
unburned fuel in Division W, due to mechanical issues.  <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Crews were able to work directly on the fire’s edge in the vicinity of Helispot 13 and construct handline to the <br />
south and then to the north and tie in with FS 646. The work along the 1926 road has been completed and will <br />
serve as a contingency line in case the spot fires in Nehi Creek decide to move east. Improving the 1925 Road <br />
and connecting it to the 1926 Road will be completed today. This will serve as a contingency line for the <br />
southeast corner.  <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Weather: There was excellent humidity recovery last night ranging from 85% to 100% over the fire. We will <br />
experience slightly cooler high temperatures, 65-70 degrees today as a result of a weak cold frontal passage. <br />
Expect to see clearer skies and warming temperatures for Tuesday and Wednesday as high pressure builds in.  <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Smoke: Today will be very similar to yesterday. Most areas will see 'Good' or 'Moderate' air quality, with a few <br />
periods of smoke in the afternoon. Oakridge, Fall Creek, and areas closest to the fire will see the most smoke, <br />
possibly at 'USG' or 'Unhealthy' levels, around mid-day and late afternoon. Smoke from other large fires in <br />
Oregon and California should stay to our south. https://oregonsmoke.blogspot.com/  or  https://fire.airnow.gov/.       <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Safety:  We are seeing increased fire traffic on road 21 with other fire resources using Hills Creek. Please keep a <br />
safe distance when traveling as logs and other materials continue to be hauled out.  <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Closures: Roads 24, 19 and 18 still remain closed in the area. Please visit <br />
https://www.fs.usda.gov/alerts/willamette/alerts-notices for information on additional closures and maps.</span>

Incident Summary:   <br />
<br />
Warmer and drier air began impacting the fire area yesterday.   Last night’s breezy east winds are forecasted to <br />
transition to north winds today.   These north dry and potentially gusty winds could produce increased surface fire <br />
and isolated single and group tree torching on the northeast side of the Complex where heat and unburned fuel <br />
remains.  On the southern and western sides of the Complex, minimal heat is being observed.  Isolated pockets <br />
of smoldering and creeping fire could occur in some areas today.   Firefighters and support crews in all areas of <br />
the Complex will continue working to contain fires utilizing a full suppression strategy. <br />
<br />
Chaos and Little Bend Fires:   <br />
<br />
The Chaos Fire is 25,392 acres, and the Little Bend Creek Fire is 8,970 acres. The northern tip of the Chaos fire <br />
that crossed the 2460 road near Fairfield Peak stayed in check yesterday. Firefighters are using hand crews and <br />
hose lays to improve containment in this area.  If favorable burning conditions allow, and if the situation warrants, <br />
crews will conduct limited firing operations west of the 3829 road to limit eastward growth.   Firefighters will work <br />
to slow the northward growth along the 3929-road fire’s edge in the Horse Heaven Creek drainage.  Yesterday, <br />
aerial bucket drops along the southeast corner of Little Bend helped hold fire in place. This helicopter work <br />
allowed crews to improve containment lines on old road networks in this area.   Crews will continue these <br />
containment efforts today. <br />
<br />
Jack and Buckhead Fires:   <br />
<br />
The Jack Fire is 24165 acres, and the Buckhead Fire is 6,861 acres. Today's winds and dry air are not expected <br />
to increase fire behavior beyond smoldering in isolated pockets.  Containment lines are holding on the west, <br />
north, and northeast perimeters. In the southeast corner of the Buckhead, fire growth has been limited through <br />
direct and indirect fire line work along road systems. Fire crews will continue to strengthen these containment <br />
lines as needed.  <br />
<br />
Near Minky Fire:   <br />
<br />
The Near Minky Fire is at 4,869 acres. This stable, southern-most fire will prevent the eastward spread of the <br />
Smith Fire as it continues to move closer to the Near Minky perimeter. The Rocky Mountain Incident <br />
Management Team on the Devil’s Knob Complex will work to contain the Smith Fire on the western portion of the <br />
Near Minky and Buckhead Fires. This work being closely coordinated with the Great Basin Incident Management <br />
Team 2.   <br />
<br />
Closures:   <br />
<br />
Copies of all closures and maps can be found at https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/closures/7758/. <br />
<br />
The Umpqua and Willamette National Forests have temporarily closed areas of both forests due to the Jack Fire, <br />
Rough Patch Complex Fire, and Devil's Knob Complex Fire. <br />
Amended BLM Roseburg District fire closure: BLM road 24-1-26 (Francis Creek) from the junction with BLM road <br />
25-1E-31 (Canton Creek Road) North to the Roseburg District Boundary in Township 24 South Range 1 West <br />
Section 1 will remain closed. <br />
<br />
Highway 138 between Roseburg and Diamond remains open. Expect short delays for hazard tree removal <br />
operations east of Glide. Slow down and be alert.</span>

operations throughout the day. Firing operations were less successful at night due to increased relative humidity <br />
below the inversion at about 4200’. Resources continued to secure and anchor line along Forest Road (FR) 1706 <br />
and the new north/south fireline (about one and half miles northwest of Cliffdell) to prevent fire spread to the <br />
north and east. Additional materials and equipment arrived and were used to reinforce structure protection in the <br />
Goose Prairie community. As expected, fire continued backing down slope on the western flank toward the <br />
Bumping River. Crews made significant progress improving dozer line around Bumping Lake and reinforcing <br />
structure protection using sprinklers and hose lays on the west side of Bumping Lake. Warmer drier conditions <br />
above the inversion allowed for slightly increased fire activity on American Ridge. Repair work continued with <br />
heavy equipment and personnel working road systems north of Rimrock Lake, Bethel Ridge and Nile Road.<br />
 <br />
Today: Firing operations are expected to continue along FR 1706. Temperatures are forecast to be the warmest <br />
for the week, with a moderately strong front coming through the area tonight. Moderate fire behavior is expected <br />
with continued creeping, smoldering and isolated torching. Operations will improve the completed dozer and <br />
hand line along the east-west section of FR 1706 and the new fireline northwest of Cliffdell. Crews and <br />
equipment will continue their work on structure protection in the north (Goose Prairie, Bumping Lake, Bumping <br />
River Road, and north/south portion of Highway 410 corridor). Suppression repairs continue throughout <br />
contained areas of the fire.<br />
<br />
Evacuations:  LEVEL 2: Bumping River Road corridor from north to south; Highway 410 corridor from Salmon <br />
Cove to Pinecliff; LEVEL 1: Highway 410 corridor from Pinecliff to the junction of U.S. Route 12, and from U.S. <br />

<br />
The Summit Trail Fire Information phone number, email address, and InciWeb page will no longer be active after <br />
8 p.m. tonight. Any future fire information will be posted on the Mt. Tolman Fire Center Facebook page at <br />
https://www.facebook.com/Mt-Tolman-Fire-Center-1049496928435678. <br />
<br />
At 7:00 a.m. on Wednesday, September 15, the Southwest Area Type 2 Incident Management Team 4 will <br />
transfer command of the Summit Trail Fire to a local Type 3 organization, led by Incident Commander Lonny <br />
Cawston. This is the final update from the Type 2 Incident Management Team. Team 4 extends its sincere thanks <br />
to the local communities for their support and hospitality throughout this incident. Due to successful firefighting <br />
efforts, the Summit Trail Fire is now 85% contained, and resources are either demobilizing to return to their home <br />
units or reassigning to assist other wildfires across the country. <br />
<br />
Operations: Firefighters are achieving success along the northern portion of the fire, increasing the depth of <br />
existing containment lines by 100 feet and extending containment on both sides. Crews will continue to pull <br />
pumps, tanks, and hoses from this area until all property is accounted for. On the northeastern flank of the fire, <br />
crews are searching on foot for any remaining heat along existing handlines. On the southern side of Hall Creek <br />
near Bear Springs, vegetation continues to smolder in a few isolated areas, although the northern section is now <br />
secured. Although some sections of fireline remain open, natural features such as wet drainages and marshes <br />
are acting as natural holding features to prevent fire spread. Interior portions of Brush Mountain continue to <br />
produce light smoke, but no flames have been detected. Crews are working across the fire area to backhaul <br />
excess equipment and return it to identified staging areas. The Suppression Repair Group is grading Hall Creek <br />
Road north of Inchelium as timber is hauled to the mills in the surrounding communities. Air resources remain <br />
available and ready to respond if the need arises.<br />
 <br />
Weather: Today will be mostly sunny and rain-free with seasonably mild temperatures. A weak cold front will <br />
move through on Wednesday, resulting in a few more clouds and breezy winds in the afternoon. Thursday will be <br />
the last rain-free and mild day of the week with light rain and cooler temperatures expected Friday through <br />
Sunday.<br />
 <br />
Safety: The health and safety of firefighters and the public is the first priority. The public is strongly encouraged to <br />
stay safely clear of the active fire area. Firefighters are conducting operations under protocols to mitigate the risk <br />
of COVID-19.  <br />
 <br />
Smoke: Smoke from surrounding fires may be visible in the area surrounding Inchelium. An interactive smoke <br />
map at https://wasmoke.blogspot.com/ allows you to zoom into your location to see the latest smoke information. <br />
Smoke-sensitive individuals and people with respiratory problems or heart disease are encouraged to take <br />
precautionary measures.</span>

<br />
Yesterday: Working northwest of Stormy Mountain along Devil’s Backbone, firefighters used aerial and hand <br />
ignition to further increase depth of the containment line west of the fire. Near East Point, in the North Fork of <br />
Thirty-five Mile Creek drainage, the fire burned actively in heavy fuels. This fire activity did not threaten <br />
containment lines but did produce smoke visible throughout the surrounding area. Heavy fuels will remain dry in <br />
the coming weeks and the fire will likely continue to burn though "islands" of green trees interior to the <br />
containment lines, producing visible smoke. Mop up continues in the Slide Peak area and elsewhere on the fire <br />
as crews continue checking for and extinguishing any hot spots. In areas where there has been no recent heat <br />
detected they continued to backhaul equipment so that it can be refurbished and made available for use where <br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Today: Firefighters will continue working to bolster the containment line west of the fire ahead of a change in <br />
weather anticipated for later this week. While cooler, wetter, weather is expected for the weekend, there remains <br />
a need to ensure a secure containment line that will stop spread of the fire given the potential for warmer, drier, <br />
conditions to return in the coming weeks. Using both hand and aerial ignition, and as conditions allow, they will <br />
be working to complete remaining firing along the line southwest of the fire. Crews will also continue the progress <br />
made completing road repairs where needed to ensure safe access for fire personnel. <br />
<br />
Weather and Fire Behavior: Yesterday was mostly sunny with continued drying which allowed for active burning <br />
in some interior areas of the fire. Today will be similar, with potential for moderate fire behavior in unburned <br />
pockets of fuel. There will be a mid-week shift in the weather that will bring colder temperatures and significant <br />
precipitation by the end of the week. Cooler, wetter weather will slow fire behavior through the weekend although <br />
there remains the potential for a return to warmer drier conditions later in the month.</span>

Tonasket, WA: <br />
<br />
Yesterday, crews pushed in the fire line from the USFS 3230 road to Antoine Creek, along the northwest flank of <br />
Bonaparte Mountain.  Fire behavior in this area continues to be minimal, which is allowing crews to engage in <br />
direct line on the fire, where safe to do so.  Fallers have been working on removing fire weakened trees along <br />
roads and behind the cabins on the west side of Bonaparte Lake. <br />
<br />
Today, crews will continue to scout out areas for indirect line towards the USFS 300 road, on the northwest flank <br />
of Bonaparte Mountain.  Repairs crews will be utilizing excavators and dozers, as well as hand crews, to work on <br />
suppression dozer and hand lines where they can impact water resources or on steep slopes. <br />
<br />
Road closures are in effect for the fire area and law enforcement will be patrolling the closed roads.  Water <br />
tenders and road graders will be maintaining access roads throughout the fire area as well as fallers evaluating <br />
and removing fire weakened trees.  For public and fire fighter safety, please help keep everyone safe and stay <br />
out of the fire area.  <br />
<br />
 The weather is expected to be dry and mostly clear for Monday and Tuesday with near normal temperatures.  <br />
With a higher relative humidity, moderating temperatures and shrinking burn window, fire behavior is continued to <br />
be minimal throughout the week.<br />
<br />
Evacuation levels have been reduced to level 1 throughout the area.</span>
