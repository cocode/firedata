Road Closures:<br />
Highway 2 remains closed just east of Index-Galena Road, near Sunset Falls (MP 36), to the junction of 5th St N into the town of Skykomish <br />
(MP 49). Local highway access is now permitted for residents with identification from the west closure to the east side of Money Creek Road. <br />
Please keep your speed under the posted limits because firefighters are working from the roads and highways.<br />
<br />
Highway 2 from the east side of the Money Creek Road (Old Cascade Highway) to the westside of 5th Street in Skykomish remains closed to <br />
all with exception to patrolling firefighters. Please understand that while fire activity has slowed, the area remains hazardous. Residents in the <br />
area should remain vigilant in fire affected areas. Property owners are asked to stay indoors for their own safety and to allow firefighters to <br />
continue their work.<br />
<br />
Update: Firefighter and public safety remains at a heightened level due to concern from gravity hazards throughout the fire area, particularly in <br />
operations along Highway 2 corridor from rollout on the steep terrain. The fire has destabilized the steep terrain above the highway resulting in <br />
rock falls, rolling debris and falling trees. Firefighters are working along the highway to identify potential hazards and remove them for public <br />
and firefighter safety.<br />
<br />
Bolt Creek Fire strategic objectives are to focus efforts on protecting values at risk along Highway 2 corridor and prevent future spread to the <br />
west and east. As of now, 71% of that work has been completed. The north side of the fire has burned into the Wild Sky Wilderness. Fire <br />
spread in the wilderness areas is expected to be minimal due to rock outcrops and other holding features which limit fire spread.<br />
<br />
Firefighters continue to work to keep the fire north of the Highway 2, to protect residences, property, and critical infrastructure around the fire <br />
area. Containment lines on the east and west flanks is nearing completion. Mop up continues along the Forest Service 6510 road. Snagging <br />
operation have been completed along the Forest Service 6022 and 6305 roads.<br />
<br />
Washington State Mobilized Resource are also developing a Risk Assessment Plan of structures for homeowners and local fire districts for <br />
future use in the Baring and Grotto areas. Firefighters may be seen in the area.<br />
<br />
Weather and Fire Behavior: Onshore flow will continue to bring light, westerly winds. Today starts a slow warming and drying trend bringing a <br />
near zero chance of precipitation through mid-week. This will lead to clearing skies today and Monday. Temperatures will be near 61°F on the <br />
upper ridges and 74°F in the valleys, with minimum relative humidity near 46%. Winds will be light, coming out of the west, and northwest at 7 <br />
mph.<br />
<br />
Evacuation Levels: Fire movement has slowed over the past 48 hours. New guidance:<br />
• Level 1 (Ready): Index and Skykomish – Unchanged.<br />
• Level 2 (Set): Baring and Grotto and area along U.S. 2 east to the Money Creek<br />
tunnel. Formerly Level 3 (Go).<br />
• Level 3 (Go): From west side of Money Creek tunnel to milepost 48, plus FS Road 65<br />
(Beckler River Road).<br />
Forest Closure: The Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest has implemented an<br />
Emergency Closure on National Forest System lands. Roads, trails, and campgrounds are<br />
closed. To read the closure in its entirety, please see: MBSNF Bolt Creek Fire Closure<br />
Smoke: Updated information on air quality may be found at Washington Smoke Blog at<br />
https://wasmoke.blogspot.com/<br />
<br />
Sheltering: The Event Center in Startup is closed and no longer providing indoor shelter.<br />
The Red Cross Shelter at the Evergreen State Fairgrounds is closed. For Red Cross<br />

CUSICK, Wash. –Northwest Incident Management Team 13, a Type 2 team under Brian Gales, assumed<br />
command of the Boulder Mountain Fire this morning.<br />
<br />
“We want to thank Great Basin Team 7 for the excellent work they’ve done, which our team will be<br />
building upon,” said Eric Riener, incident commander trainee for NW13.<br />
<br />
Recently, the fire has been most active on the south end of the fire footprint. Crews will continue to<br />
develop operational plans for perimeter containment.<br />
<br />
Hose lays on the northeast corner are being removed except where hot spots remain. Hazard trees<br />
have been decked and are being removed as well. Suppression repair work has begun and will be a<br />
primary focus going forward for NW13.<br />
<br />
Suppression repair is a series of post-fire actions taken to obscure containment lines and minimize<br />
potential soil erosion.<br />
<br />
The southeast corner of the fire is fully contained. Crews are monitoring and mopping up to a depth of<br />
150 feet from the contained line, while removing hose and beginning suppression repair.<br />
<br />
Pockets of unburnt vegetation will continue to be consumed within the interior of the fire perimeter,<br />
likely until a season ending weather event occurs.<br />
<br />
Forecasted warmer temperatures continue to dry out finer fuels, such as leaves, needles and grasses,<br />
which might increase fire activity in previously unburned areas within the fire perimeter.<br />
<br />
Safety: Watch for slower-moving traffic, including heavy equipment and firefighters on foot, in and<br />
around the fire zone and the incident command post in Cusick.<br />
<br />
Closures: An area closure remains in place for the Boulder Mountain Fire on the Colville National<br />
Forest. For a map and complete description of the closure area, including a list of trails and roads, go to<br />
https://www.fs.usda.gov/alerts/colville/alerts-notices. Violations of this order are punishable by a fine<br />
of not more than $5,000 for an individual or $10,000 for an organization, or imprisonment for not more<br />
than 6 months, or both.</span>

West Zone Update: Firefighters took advantage of brief windows of opportunity to complete almost 2,000 more acres of firing operations to <br />
secure primary containment line along the west and southwest edge of the Cedar Creek Fire Saturday. Crews were engaged throughout the <br />
shift felling snags (dead or fire weakened trees) and burning to reduce ground vegetation between the main fire and the primary containment <br />
line. Firing operations included both hand ignition and the use of drones. Helicopter operations were grounded due to poor visibility.<br />
<br />
“The northwest corner of the fire where crews have successfully brought the fire down to the primary containment line is looking good overall,” <br />
according to Incident Commander Randy Johnson. Today’s operations on the West Zone will be weather dependent. In addition to continued <br />
firing operations as weather and fuel moisture permit, both day and night- shift crews are actively patrolling and mopping up as needed to <br />
secure the fireline.<br />
<br />
Some lightning was reported on Saturday and crews assigned to the Cedar Creek fire are ready to assist with initial attack response as <br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Oakridge Community Meeting: About 140 people participated in the community meeting hosted both online and at the Oakridge High School <br />
on Saturday. A recording of the meeting is available online at:https://business.facebook.com/CedarCreekFire2022/videos/778408616760921/<br />
<br />
East Zone Operations: The East Zone is experiencing minimal fire behavior with creeping, smoldering, and single tree torching. With rain over <br />
the next couple days, the fire on the east side will grow minimally. Sheltered heat may reemerge after the rain if fuels continue to be dry <br />
enough.<br />
<br />
Crews are mopping up and mitigating hazards in North Waldo Campground. Hotshot crews continue mop up the fire that crossed FS 4290 <br />
and improve the road as a holding feature, working east to the Cascade Lakes Highway. On the east side of Waldo Lake, crews continue to <br />
improve the fuel break along FS 5897 to meet Highway 58. Crews continue to work FS 4668 and FS4660 to create a break between Odell <br />
Lake and Davis Lake. Between Little Cultus Lake and Deer Lake, crews are brushing, chipping, and removing snags along FS 640 to protect <br />
Cultus Mountain from future fire advancement. Chipping, snagging, and brushing is also connecting the fire break from Little Cultus Lake to <br />
the Cascade Lakes Highway along FS 700. Work continues along the west side of the Cascade Lakes Highway to create a shaded fuel break. <br />
Masticators are working along State Route 58 north of Odell Lake.<br />
<br />
Weather: Given the size and geographic location of the fire, there are a variety of conditions over the fire at any given time. While some areas <br />
may be receiving rain, hail or even snow, other areas may not get any precipitation. The East Zone experienced scattered rain, thunderstorms, <br />
and hail on Saturday. Across the fire area, there was 0.1 to 0.4 inches of precipitation. Some scattered rain is likely to extend into Sunday with <br />
winds from the southeast. Monday will be dry before another possible rain pattern on Tuesday.<br />
<br />

Sedro Woolley, WA – Weather conditions along with dry fuels continue to increase fire activity on the lightning-caused Chilliwack <br />
Complex. Increased easterly winds, high temperatures, and low humidity throughout the area have prompted a Red Flag Warning from <br />
the National Weather Service through Sunday evening. On Friday, the Copper Lake and Copper Ridge fires merged, and the North <br />
Fork and Little Chill fires merged. The two fires are now known as Copper Lake and Little Chill fires, respectively. The Silesia Fire had <br />
significant growth and is approximately one mile from the forest boundary with the Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest. This fire <br />
activity has prompted the closure of the Silesia Creek Trail. The Chilliwack Complex is made up of several active fires (Little Chill, <br />
Copper Lake, Brush Creek, Silesia, and Little Beaver Creek).<br />
<br />
 Crews continue protection measures on a pack bridge and suspension bridge near the Brush Creek Fire and on the cable car <br />
potentially threatened by the Copper Lake Fire. Firefighters continue to utilize helicopter bucket work on the Little Beaver Creek Fire.<br />
<br />
<br />
The Washington Department of Ecology announced an Air Quality Alert due to current wildfire smoke from the fires in the North <br />
Cascades. North and northeasterly winds are moving into the area, pushing regional smoke impacts from fires into the greater <br />
Bellingham-Seattle metropolitan area. Increasing smoke impacts, reduced visibility and short periods of UNHEALTHY air quality are <br />
expected into Sunday. As southwest winds return late Sunday, smoke impacts will shift back into the Wenatchee, Chelan, and <br />
Okanogan valleys. Take precautions when recreating outdoors when heavy smoke is present. Learn more at Real-Time Air Quality Map <br />
| PurpleAir, airnow.gov or visit https://wasmoke.blogspot.com/.  <br />
  <br />
Trail and camp closures remain in effect due to fire activity. Closure information can be found at <br />
https://www.nps.gov/noca/planyourvisit/trail-conditions.htm  <br />

Due to decreased fire activity, this will be the last daily update. If conditions change, information will be shared via the Crockets Knob <br />
Fire’s Facebook and Inciweb.  <br />
<br />
 Weather: Today will be dry with light winds. Temperatures will be in the low-70s, and the minimal relative humidity will be near 25 <br />
percent. Widespread smoke haze will be visible throughout <br />
the area.  <br />
<br />
Operations: Yesterday two excavators began conducting suppression repairs on the fire. One excavator worked along FSR 4555 and <br />
the other along interior containment lines near Indian <br />
Rock Lookout. The excavators were scattering fuels and constructing water bars. Crews continued to patrol containment lines all <br />
around the fire looking for any remaining heat. For the <br />
foreseeable future, firefighters will continue focusing on suppression repairs, monitoring and patrol along containment lines.  <br />
<br />
Closures and Evacuations:  There are no county evacuation alerts, and County Road 20 (Middle Fork Road) is open to all motorists.  <br />
<br />
The Malheur and Umatilla National Forests’ fire area closure remains in effect for areas east of FSR 45. However, the Forests’ will likely <br />
reduce the closure area within the next day or two. To <br />
stay informed about closure information, please continue checking: https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/malheur/notices/?<br />
cid=STELPRD3845529   <br />
<br />
Smoke may be visible to nearby communities and Forest visitors. Smoke and air quality impacts within the state can be monitored by <br />
visiting: http://oregonsmoke.blogspot.com <br />
<br />
The Malheur National Forest’s Public Use Restriction is Phase C on the Blue Mountain and Prairie City Ranger Districts. No campfires <br />
or personal chainsaw use is allowed. The Umatilla <br />
National Forest remains in Phase B, which allows campfires only in designated campgrounds and recreation sites. For more <br />
information, please go to: <br />
https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/malheur/fire, and  <br />
<br />
https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/umatilla/alerts-notices. <br />
<br />
Fire Danger remains Extreme for the surrounding area. The public can help us by making good decisions when they recreate on public <br />
lands and by following local fire restrictions.</span>

Highlights: Fire activity will remain minimal through the weekend allowing firefighters to take advantage of the cooler and wetter weather. A <br />
suppression repair branch was activated today. The goal of suppression repair is to return damaged areas to a stable condition that reflects <br />
pre-fire conditions. Post-fire repair efforts include debris removal, fence and gate repair, dozer line rehab, and other damage repair related to<br />
wildland fire suppression operations.<br />
<br />
Double Creek Fire: 157,185 acres | 27% contained |740 personnel assigned<br />
The lightning-caused Double Creek Fire is a full suppression fire, with the protection of lives and property the primary objectives. Crews <br />
scouted the northern perimeter of the fire to identify areas for suppression actions. Firefighters are planning to take advantage of the cooler <br />
and wetter weather to limit the fire’s spread. Crews are continuing to monitor and mop up the west side of the fire.<br />
Eagle Cap Wilderness Fires<br />
<br />
The Nebo, Sturgill, and Goat Mountain 2 Fires were lightning-caused and are being managed to protect public and private infrastructure while <br />
playing a natural role within designated Wilderness. Managing wildfire is a strategic choice to use naturally ignited fires to accomplish <br />
ecological and fuel reduction objectives. For example, certain trees require fire to germinate their seeds. Fire contributes to nutrient<br />
cycling, stimulating growth of grasses, herbs, and shrubs and creating new habitat for wildlife. Managed wildfire also reduces built-up fuels <br />
that could lead to an even bigger wildfire in the future if left unchecked.<br />
<br />
Nebo Fire: 12,588 acres | 92 personnel assigned<br />
Crews will continue mastication and chipping on the 3925 road today, cleaning up the remaining trees and brush left over from prepping that <br />
road as a fire break. That work should be completed by end of shift.<br />
<br />
Sturgill Fire: 20,075 acres | 52 personnel assigned<br />
The north end of the Sturgill Fire continues to show heat and moderate fire behavior. Work will continue on the shaded fuel break from Lostine <br />
to Bear Creek Road. The fuel break is approximately 90 percent completed with the remainder expected to be completed in the coming days. <br />
Monitoring and point protection continue around Red’s Horse Ranch.<br />
<br />
Goat Mountain 2 Fire: 536 acres | 0 personnel assigned<br />
Fire activity on the Goat Mountain 2 Fire is minimal. Aircraft will continue to monitor the fire as smoke and weather permit.<br />
<br />
Weather: Cooler temperatures and higher humidity should persist for the next several days. Showers and thunderstorms are possible <br />
throughout the day. Wetting rain is most likely over the Sturgill Fire with a decreased likelihood as the system moves to the Northeast. <br />
Precipitation is possible through Thursday then we move into a period of warmer and drier weather beginning on Friday.<br />
<br />
Wallowa-Whitman National Forest Temporary Area Closures: The Wallowa-Whitman National Forest issued Temporary Area Closures for the <br />
Double Creek Fire, Nebo Fire, and Sturgill and Goat Mountain 2 Fires. Closure Orders and Maps are available on the Wallowa-Whitman <br />
National Forest Fire Incident Updates page.<br />
<br />
Road Closures: Lostine River Road at the Forest Service boundary is closed. Highway 350 going to the town<br />
of Imnaha is open. Lower Imnaha Road and Dug Bar Road are closed, Upper Imnaha Road is closed, Hat<br />
Point Road is closed, and FS 39 Road is closed from Target Springs Junction to Ollokot Campground<br />
[including the Canal Rd (3920) and Lick Creek Road (3925)].</span>

<br />
Overview: The Goat Rocks Fire continues to burn 1.5 miles northeast of the town of Packwood, Washington in and around the Goat Rocks <br />
Wilderness area. Firefighters continue to thin and remove fuels along roads to act as fuel breaks and remove the fuels cut from around <br />
structures in the Timberline, Goat Rocks, and High Valley communities.<br />
<br />
Fire Activity: Yesterday firefighters completed a section of contingency line connecting Forest Road 4610 and Forest Road 041, providing an <br />
additional option for the protection of the community of Packwood. A chipper was also utilized, and crews began to chip the material cut and <br />
gathered from around the structures.<br />
<br />
Today, personnel will be working along the Forest Road 041 and 4610 to improve and strengthen contingency lines where needed. With the <br />
completion of the hand line, equipment and firefighters will be reassigned to Forest Road 46 north of the fire to speed up the chipping process <br />
there. Firefighters will continue to chip the material cut from around homes and dispose of the brush and other debris gathered during <br />
structure protection operations.<br />
<br />
Containment: Fire managers typically consider a portion of line contained when the control line is in place, fuels between the control line and <br />
main fire have been burned away, and all heat has been extinguished next to the line. Due to the difficult terrain, firefighters have been unable <br />
to safely engage the fire’s edge. To protect personnel and minimize the impact on the Wilderness Area, crews have been constructing control <br />
lines along the existing road systems around the fire. Burning the fuels between the line and the fire’s edge would increase containment but it <br />
would also dramatically increase the size of the fire.<br />
<br />
Forest Closures: For information on current road and trail closures, you can go to this link: <br />
https://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fseprd1060181.pdf<br />
<br />
Evacuations: All of Packwood and areas southwest of Butter Creek, including High Valley, have had their evacuation orders lifted. Areas <br />
northeast of Butter Creek and north of US-12, including Lower Timberline and Goat Rocks, are still at an Evacuation Level 1 (Be Ready). <br />
Upper Timberline remains at an Evacuation Level 2 (Be Set).<br />
<br />
Fire Restrictions: Campfire bans, and other use restrictions are in place across the Gifford Pinchot National Forest and much of the region. <br />
Campfires are allowed within certain campgrounds on an approved list at: https://www.fs.usda.gov/alerts/giffordpinchot/alerts-notices.<br />
<br />
Weather: Higher temperatures and a lower humidity will continue today but there will be a slight chance for rain in the evening. Light winds out <br />
of the east will continue to blow warm dry air over the pass and push smoke into Packwood and the surrounding communities. This increase <br />
in smoke is not due to an uptick in fire activity but rather movement of smoke already affecting the area. The winds will remain light and not <br />
cause additional fire spread.<br />
<br />
Public Safety: Increased traffic is expected with the ongoing weekend activities and fire personnel continuing to work in the area. Please use <br />
caution when traveling near the area and adhere to the posted speed limits.<br />
<br />
Donations: Northwest Incident Management Team 10 would like to extend to the community a heartfelt thank you for all your generous offers <br />
to provide donations to firefighters. Firefighters are well-provisioned, so we invite you to donate to your local Red Cross, Lewis County Fire <br />
District #10 (Packwood) and the Wildland Firefighter Foundation.<br />

Plain, WA – Lightning started the White River and Irving Peak Fires on August 11th. The Minnow Ridge Fire cause is undetermined. <br />
These fires are burning on the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest.<br />
<br />
Suppression Strategy – Due to rugged and steep terrain, fire managers continue to implement a long-term strategy to manage these <br />
fires, including the use of primary and contingency perimeter lines for containment. Tactics include completion and reinforcement of fire <br />
lines utilizing forest roads and constructed hand line.<br />
<br />
Current Situation – A local Type 3 Incident Management Team assumed command of the fires on September 7th and is currently <br />
managing the White River, Irving Peak, Meander, and now Minnow Ridge fires. The Meander Fire remains at 6 acres with very minimal <br />
fire activity. Smoke may be visible over the next several weeks as interior fuels continue to smolder and burn out, and multiple fires burn <br />
region-wide. Updates will be posted weekly unless significant new activity occurs.<br />
<br />
White River Fire – Acres: 3,184 (as of 9/13/2022); 5% contained; Location: Sears Creek area of the White River drainage, <br />
approximately 14 miles NW of Plain, WA.<br />
The fire area remains drier and more active along the southern edges. The fire footprint remains within the control lines, and geographic <br />
features being utilized as containment lines. Firefighters are working to establish an anchor point and maintain the structure protection <br />
along Sears Creek Road and Windmill Lane.<br />
<br />
Irving Peak Fire – Acres: 3,226 (as of 9/9/2022); 5% contained; Location: Approximately 16 miles NW of Plain, WA<br />
The Irving Peak Fire received some precipitation yesterday with minimal growth and fire activity. Firefighters continue to improve roads <br />
used as containment lines and monitor fire activity.<br />
<br />
Minnow Ridge Fire – Acres: 502 (as of 9/13/2022); 0% contained; Location: Chikamin Ridge, approximately 14 miles N of Plain, WA.<br />
Fire activity has been moderate and mainly consuming ground fuels. Firefighters continue scouting forest roads and fire lines previously <br />
utilized during past wildfire activity to determine if they may benefit the current fire suppression strategy.  <br />
<br />
Weather – A chance of showers exists over the fire area today, Wednesday, September 14th, with west winds around 6-8 mph. Cooler <br />
temperatures and higher relative humidity continue into later this week.<br />
<br />
Air Quality and Smoke – Current information about air quality and health recommendations during smoky conditions is available on the <br />
Washington Smoke Blog https://wasmoke.blogspot.com/<br />
<br />
Closures – An emergency closure issued by the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest remains in place and can be viewed here: <br />
www.fs.usda.gov/alerts/okawen/alerts-notices. The PCT remains open and is not directly impacted by these fires. Several trails in the <br />
Chikamin Ridge area are pending closure due to the Minnow Ridge Fire. Fire managers are asking people to please respect these <br />
closures while recreating in the area.<br />
<br />
Restrictions – Campfires are not allowed anywhere within the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest. Stage 2 Restrictions are now in <br />
effect for the entire forest, including campgrounds and wilderness areas: www.fs.usda.gov/detail/okawen/alerts-notices/?<br />
cid=fsbdev3_053600.<br />
<br />
Evacuations – Current Chelan County evacuation levels include a Level 2 evacuation (Be Prepared) for Sears Creek Road and Level 1 <br />
(Stay Alert) for White River Road and Little Wenatchee Road. www.co.chelan.wa.us/emergency-management/pages/active-<br />

						    <span class="textarea">Increased fire activity on some of the lightning caused fires, burning in the very remote, steep, and inaccessible terrain in the northwest <br />
corner of the Pasayten Wilderness Area, spurred trail and area closures over the holiday weekend. Hot, dry, and windy conditions are <br />
expected today as a trough moves into the area which is expected to create conditions for increased fire behavior. The Shull, The <br />
Parks, Kid, Three Fools, Skagit, and Elbow fires, located near the Canadian-U.S border, are expected to grow in acreage today.<br />
<br />
In a joint delegation with the National Park Service, a National Incident Management Organization Team, NIMO Team 2, assumed <br />
command yesterday over the six fires now being called the NW Pasayten Fires, located in the Pasayten Wilderness on the Methow <br />
Valley Ranger District of the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest, as well as the Chilliwack Complex Fires within the North Cascades <br />
National Park Service Complex.<br />
<br />
A number of closures are in effect including an area closure for the Freezeout Creek basin and a number of trails and portions of trails <br />
in the area. Portions of both the Pacific Crest Trail and Pacific Northwest Trail remain closed at this time.<br />
<br />
Smoke from these fires, and other fires burning in the region, may impact north central Washington communities over the next few <br />
days. Take precautions when recreating outdoors when heavy smoke is present. Learn more at Real-Time Air Quality Map | PurpleAir, <br />
airnow.gov or visit https://wasmoke.blogspot.com/.<br />
<br />
Update on individual NW Pasayten Fires:<br />
•     The Kid Fire, located on the ridge between Rock Creek and West Fork Pasayten, is approximately 8 miles south of the Canadian-<br />
U.S. border. The fire has been very active with spotting and torching of grouped trees. Yesterday, smokejumpers worked on protection <br />
of the historic airport cabin, situated about one quarter mile away from the Kid Fire, utilizing pumps and sprinklers. If conditions allow, <br />
smokejumpers will also be burning out unburned brush between the fire and the cabin.<br />
•     The Parks Fire is also very active. It crossed the border into Canada a couple of days ago. There is a Canadian Incident <br />
Management Team assigned to the Canadian portion (called the Heather Fire north of the border) of the Parks Fire. The fire is about <br />
one half mile from the Monument 83 Fire Lookout at the time of this release. Firefighters have prepared the lookout by wrapping the <br />
base with fire protective wrap.<br />
•    The Skagit Fire, located in Freezeout Creek 6 miles south of the border, spread northward and crossed over the top of the ridge and <br />
down the other side.<br />
•     Three Fools Fire, located 8 miles south of the border, is actively backing down the ridge and through an old burn scar, it has spotted <br />
north of the ridge. <br />
•     The Elbow Fire, located 6 miles south of the border, is actively backing down the slope near Skagit Peak.<br />
•     Tuesday, fire activity increased on the Shull Fire located 11 miles south of the border.</span>

MERLIN, Ore. – Moderate weather contributed to no new fire growth yesterday and containment remains at 83 percent for the Rum Creek <br />
Fire. Wind gusts are expected today for upper slopes and ridges, but elsewhere the projected consecutive days of repeated moisture this <br />
weekend should facilitate continued suppression, mop up and patrol, and opportunities for rehab/repair where appropriate.<br />
<br />
Thanks to progress made by firefighters on the Rum Creek Fire, the Bureau of Land Management Grants Pass Field Office has reopened <br />
some areas of public lands near the Rum Creek Fire. The closure area is bound to the north by the Rogue River and Lower Grave Creek <br />
Road, and to the south by Galice Road and Bear Camp Road. The western boundary extends to Township 34S Range 9 West and the <br />
eastern boundary extends to Township 34 South Range 6 West. The revised closure order and map will be posted on BLM.GOV: <br />
https://www.blm.gov/programs/public-safety-and-fire/fire-and-aviation/regional-info/oregon-washington/fire-restrictions.<br />
<br />
Public and firefighter safety remain the highest priority. Before venturing out to re-opened public lands near the Rum Creek Fire, be aware that <br />
fire traffic may still be seen in the area. Please follow closures and call BLM at 541-471-6500 for additional information. Ash and dust from the <br />
fire may contain toxic and cancer-causing chemicals. Watch out for fire weakened trees and limbs that can fall without warning. Leave the <br />
area if wind picks up immediately. In wet weather, water or mud may cause landslides or flooding. Stump holes can remain hot long after the <br />
fire is out, and footing can be unstable if roots have burned out underground.  Hot spots still exist within the fire perimeter.<br />
<br />
 <br />

<br />
Klamath Falls, Ore. – Last night fire crews continued to use infrared cameras to identify areas of heat around the perimeter of the fire. <br />
They are mainly finding heat under juniper trees on the southern and western areas.<br />
<br />
Today is the last day the Oregon Department of Forestry’s Type 1 Incident Management Team will be in command of the fire. Transition <br />
to the local Type 4 team will happen tomorrow at noon. The objectives for the local team will remain the same. Multiple engines and <br />
crews will continue to mop up where it warrants.<br />
<br />
Weather today will be cooler and more humid. Gusty winds are expected in the late afternoon and early evening.<br />
<br />
Residential traffic is allowed in the fire area, but residents are encouraged to drive slowly and be aware of fire operation traffic as they <br />
travel through the fire. Bureau of Land Management lands in and around the fire area remain closed to the public.<br />
<br />
We would like to remind the public that Klamath and Lake counties are still in extreme fire danger. Human-cause fire stats are down this <br />
fire season, so please help your local resources by preventing anything that can spark a fire. Visit <br />
https://www.oregon.gov/odf/fire/pages/restrictions.aspx for fire restrictions in your area or areas you may be traveling to.  <br />
<br />
This will be the final fire update from the ODF IMT. The team would like to thank the cooperators and public for their support during the <br />
fire. Without local resources and support from the community our team would not have been as successful.</span>

						    <span class="textarea">White River and Irving Peak Fire Update<br />
September 14, 2022<br />
<br />
Plain, WA – Lightning started the White River and Irving Peak Fires on August 11th. The Minnow Ridge Fire cause is undetermined. <br />
These fires are burning on the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest.<br />
<br />
Suppression Strategy – Due to rugged and steep terrain, fire managers continue to implement a long-term strategy to manage these <br />
fires, including the use of primary and contingency perimeter lines for containment. Tactics include completion and reinforcement of fire <br />
lines utilizing forest roads and constructed hand line.<br />
<br />
Current Situation – A local Type 3 Incident Management Team assumed command of the fires on September 7th and is currently <br />
managing the White River, Irving Peak, Meander, and now Minnow Ridge fires. The Meander Fire remains at 6 acres with very minimal <br />
fire activity. Smoke may be visible over the next several weeks as interior fuels continue to smolder and burn out, and multiple fires burn <br />
region-wide. Updates will be posted weekly unless significant new activity occurs.<br />
<br />
White River Fire – Acres: 3,184 (as of 9/13/2022); 5% contained; Location: Sears Creek area of the White River drainage, <br />
approximately 14 miles NW of Plain, WA.<br />
The fire area remains drier and more active along the southern edges. The fire footprint remains within the control lines, and geographic <br />
features being utilized as containment lines. Firefighters are working to establish an anchor point and maintain the structure protection <br />
along Sears Creek Road and Windmill Lane.<br />
<br />
Irving Peak Fire – Acres: 3,226 (as of 9/9/2022); 5% contained; Location: Approximately 16 miles NW of Plain, WA<br />
The Irving Peak Fire received some precipitation yesterday with minimal growth and fire activity. Firefighters continue to improve roads <br />
used as containment lines and monitor fire activity.<br />
<br />
Minnow Ridge Fire – Acres: 502 (as of 9/13/2022); 0% contained; Location: Chikamin Ridge, approximately 14 miles N of Plain, WA.<br />
Fire activity has been moderate and mainly consuming ground fuels. Firefighters continue scouting forest roads and fire lines previously <br />
utilized during past wildfire activity to determine if they may benefit the current fire suppression strategy.  <br />
<br />
Weather – A chance of showers exists over the fire area today, Wednesday, September 14th, with west winds around 6-8 mph. Cooler <br />
temperatures and higher relative humidity continue into later this week.<br />
<br />
Air Quality and Smoke – Current information about air quality and health recommendations during smoky conditions is available on the <br />
Washington Smoke Blog https://wasmoke.blogspot.com/<br />
<br />
Closures – An emergency closure issued by the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest remains in place and can be viewed here: <br />
www.fs.usda.gov/alerts/okawen/alerts-notices. The PCT remains open and is not directly impacted by these fires. Several trails in the <br />
Chikamin Ridge area are pending closure due to the Minnow Ridge Fire. Fire managers are asking people to please respect these <br />
closures while recreating in the area.<br />
<br />
Restrictions – Campfires are not allowed anywhere within the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest. Stage 2 Restrictions are now in <br />
effect for the entire forest, including campgrounds and wilderness areas: www.fs.usda.gov/detail/okawen/alerts-notices/?<br />
cid=fsbdev3_053600.<br />
<br />
Evacuations – Current Chelan County evacuation levels include a Level 2 evacuation (Be Prepared) for Sears Creek Road and Level 1 <br />
(Stay Alert) for White River Road and Little Wenatchee Road. www.co.chelan.wa.us/emergency-management/pages/active-<br />
