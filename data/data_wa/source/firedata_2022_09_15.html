Update: The Bolt Creek Fire started on Saturday, September 10, 2022, at 5:15 am near Beckler Road in King County, WA. The cause of <br />
the fire is undetermined. Northwest Incident Management Team 8, Incident Commander Kevin Stock, is managing the fire.  <br />
<br />
Favorable weather conditions continue to keep the fire moderately active with minimal perimeter growth toward Highway 2 and <br />
neighboring communities. The fire continues to slowly back downhill toward the highway, primarily burning ground fuels with minimal <br />
tree torching. Firefighters continue to monitor the area, remove hazard trees, and preventing  <br />
<br />
~~~more~~~ <br />
<br />
the fire from crossing Highway 2. Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) will bring in specialists to analyze safety <br />
conditions prior to opening the highway. Puget Sound Energy is working to restore power lines in the area.  <br />
<br />
Crews are using heavy equipment including feller bunchers, masticators, and chippers to clear brush and fuels along roads that will be <br />
used as primary or alternate fire lines. Firefighters will work along Forest Service Road (FSR) 6510 and Beckler Road removing fuels to <br />
use as a holding feature on the east edge of the fire. FSR 6022 (Heybrook Lookout Road) from Highway 2 to the Index-Galena Road <br />
along the west fire perimeter will also be prepared as a holding line. Night shifts will continue to provide patrols and monitor fire activity. <br />
<br />
Washington State Mobilization Resources are present working to secure the safety of homes and structures. We appreciate their <br />
support in keeping local communities safe.  <br />
<br />
Weather and Fire Behavior: A weak storm system will slide across the region today bringing scattered showers and thunderstorms.  <br />
Thunderstorms may bring gusty outflow winds and hail. Temperatures are forecast to be 58-64°F, with minimum relative humidity near <br />
90%.  Winds will be light, coming out of the west at 5-6 mph in the afternoon. <br />
<br />
Fuels remain dry and the fire will move primarily where wind and slopes align in steep terrain. The fire is still capable of large runs if <br />
winds increase above 25 mph. However, high winds are not currently predicted. Fine fuel moistures are increasing as moisture and <br />
relative humidity increase. <br />
<br />
Smoke: Updated information on air quality may be found at Washington Smoke Blog at https://wasmoke.blogspot.com/ <br />
<br />
Air Space Restrictions: A Temporary Flight Restriction (TFR) is in place over the Bolt Creek Fire. Please review the Notice to Airmen in <br />
its entirety. Please help the firefighters by respecting the TFR. If you fly, we can’t! <br />
<br />
Sheltering: Snohomish County and the American Red Cross are providing indoor shelter and RV slots at the Evergreen State <br />
Fairgrounds, located at 14405 179th Ave. SE, Monroe. For shelter assistance, proceed to the Weikel Building at the fairgrounds or RV <br />
Lot 2. Staff will be on-site to assist you. Assistance is also available at Start-up Event Center.</span>

Summary: The Boulder Mountain Fire was detected on Wednesday August 31st, 2022, at approximately 6:00 pm. The fire is located in <br />
the Tacoma Creek and Boulder Mountain area, 9 miles Northwest of Cusick, Washington. A mix of State, Federal and Private land is <br />
impacted. The terrain is difficult, and the fire is burning in heavy timber, slash, and beetle infested trees. Cause of the fire remains under <br />
investigation. <br />
<br />
Weather|Anticipated Fire Behavior: SW wind yesterday was a favorable asset as it helped to push active fire back into the burn area. <br />
Higher humidity, higher moisture content in the air will benefit fire fighters today as well. There is a potential for rain throughout the day <br />
with thunderstorm activity possible and initial attack crews are prepared to respond if necessary. Rain could produce a temporary <br />
reprieve from fuels driven fire behavior, problem fuels on this fire have been the older timber types. A significant factor has been the <br />
dryness of the dead and downed heavy fuel component. Any dead log over 8” diameter is considered a 1000-hour fuel. The fuel <br />
moisture in a 1000-hour log has an approximate 41-day time lag for it to mostly catch up to large changes in atmospheric moisture. <br />
Compare that with a blade of dry grass which is a 1-hour fuel.  While rain is most welcome, the timber fuel type will take some time to <br />
react to the current changing weather. <br />
<br />
Actions: Firefighters continue to make good progress; containment is up to 50% as of this morning. The work on the southern edge is <br />
going well and resources will focus on that area again today with the intent of ensuring the fire edge is holding. Throughout the burn <br />
area mop up targeting remaining hot spots is in full force.  Patrolling of the perimeter continues confirming that line threats have <br />
significantly diminished. The forecast shows improved visibility, but potential storms may still impact air support.  <br />
<br />
Important Information: Knowing that many are making weekend plans for fall camping, hiking, and perhaps hunting, a quick reminder - <br />
the Boulder Mountain Fire Closure area affecting the Colville National Forest is still in effect. These areas are closed to the public, roads <br />
and trails included. Please be familiar with the closure before venturing out. Colville National Forest - Home (usda.gov)</span>

The fire remains active, burning with low to moderate intensity. Although fire behavior has calmed considerably since last weekend, <br />
fuels are still dry and combustible. Smoke will continue to linger through the week, impacting air quality. Smoke is primarily impacting <br />
communities on the east side of the fire, particularly La Pine, Crescent Lake, Sun River, and Bend.  <br />
<br />
West Zone Operations: The west zone continues to focus on the protecting the communities of Oakridge and Westfir and the Highway <br />
58 corridor. Crews took advantage of fire behavior that was moderated by higher humidity throughout the day. Firefighters continued <br />
improving Forest Road 19 as well as other road systems to use as containment lines. To the west of the fire, firefighters identified <br />
ridgetops where they will conduct firing operations to bring the fire toward containment lines. These firing operations will reduce <br />
vegetation between the front of the fire and the fireline, thereby moderating burn intensity and improving the effectiveness of the <br />
containment lines. In addition, crews conducted strategic firing operations near Eagle Butte. On the southern edge, the fire continued to <br />
back down slopes from Bunchgrass Ridge toward the rail line. A hotshot crew connected handline along the southern boundary west of <br />
Fuji Mountain and implemented firing operations along that fireline to reduce ground vegetation in advance of the main fire. Structural <br />
crews continued to perform tactical patrols near Odell Lake; Wednesday they will support burn operations near Highway 58 to remove <br />
fuels between the fire’s edge and the highway. Low visibility limited the ability to use helicopters and airplanes for most of the day. <br />
Structural firefighters continued their work in the High Prairie area. The night shift worked to support burn operations when conditions <br />
were favorable, and Wednesday’s shift will focus on supporting mop up work and performing tactical patrols. <br />
<br />
Today, crews supported by heavy equipment will keep thinning and chipping vegetation to improve roads for use as containment lines. <br />
Work along the roads includes removing snags that may pose a threat to firefighters. As conditions allow, firefighters will use aerial and <br />
hand ignition to improve effectiveness of containment lines. Firefighters are reducing vegetation and improving roads between <br />
containment lines and the active fire to be used as a way to slow the fire and reduce intensity as it approaches the control features. <br />
<br />
East Zone Operations: Junction camp was established Tuesday near the intersection of Oregon State Routes 429 and 58. This camp <br />
positions 210 firefighters closer to their work in the Odell Lake area. Two Type 2 crews and hot shots are assessing and protecting <br />
structures around Odell Lake, including Golden Lake Campground, Willamette Pass, and the Diamond Peak area. Protection measures <br />
include clearing brush from around structures and laying hose and sprinklers. <br />
<br />
Road prep was started and will continue over the next few days on Forest Road 5897 from State Route 58 to Fuji Mountain Trail. Hand <br />
crews are also working to join Forest Roads 4660 and 4668. Hand crews have also been working Forest Road 700 near Brown <br />
Mountain, south of Crane Prairie Reservoir. Heavy equipment continues along the Cascade Lakes Highway, creating a 100-foot fire <br />
break on the west side of the road. To the north, structure protection continues around Lava Lake.</span>

Sedro Woolley, WA – Weather conditions along with dry fuels continue to increase fire activity on the lightning-caused Chilliwack <br />
Complex. Increased easterly winds, high temperatures, and low humidity throughout the area have prompted a Red Flag Warning from <br />
the National Weather Service through Sunday evening. On Friday, the Copper Lake and Copper Ridge fires merged, and the North <br />
Fork and Little Chill fires merged. The two fires are now known as Copper Lake and Little Chill fires, respectively. The Silesia Fire had <br />
significant growth and is approximately one mile from the forest boundary with the Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest. This fire <br />
activity has prompted the closure of the Silesia Creek Trail. The Chilliwack Complex is made up of several active fires (Little Chill, <br />
Copper Lake, Brush Creek, Silesia, and Little Beaver Creek).<br />
<br />
 Crews continue protection measures on a pack bridge and suspension bridge near the Brush Creek Fire and on the cable car <br />
potentially threatened by the Copper Lake Fire. Firefighters continue to utilize helicopter bucket work on the Little Beaver Creek Fire.<br />
<br />
<br />
The Washington Department of Ecology announced an Air Quality Alert due to current wildfire smoke from the fires in the North <br />
Cascades. North and northeasterly winds are moving into the area, pushing regional smoke impacts from fires into the greater <br />
Bellingham-Seattle metropolitan area. Increasing smoke impacts, reduced visibility and short periods of UNHEALTHY air quality are <br />
expected into Sunday. As southwest winds return late Sunday, smoke impacts will shift back into the Wenatchee, Chelan, and <br />
Okanogan valleys. Take precautions when recreating outdoors when heavy smoke is present. Learn more at Real-Time Air Quality Map <br />
| PurpleAir, airnow.gov or visit https://wasmoke.blogspot.com/.  <br />
  <br />
Trail and camp closures remain in effect due to fire activity. Closure information can be found at <br />
https://www.nps.gov/noca/planyourvisit/trail-conditions.htm  <br />

Due to decreased fire activity, this will be the last daily update. If conditions change, information will be shared via the Crockets Knob Fire’s Facebook and Inciweb.  <br />
<br />
 Weather: Today will be dry with light winds. Temperatures will be in the low-70s, and the minimal relative humidity will be near 25 percent. Widespread smoke haze will be visible throughout <br />
the area.  <br />
<br />
Operations: Yesterday two excavators began conducting suppression repairs on the fire. One excavator worked along FSR 4555 and the other along interior containment lines near Indian <br />
Rock Lookout. The excavators were scattering fuels and constructing water bars. Crews continued to patrol containment lines all around the fire looking for any remaining heat. For the <br />
foreseeable future, firefighters will continue focusing on suppression repairs, monitoring and patrol along containment lines.  <br />
<br />
Closures and Evacuations:  There are no county evacuation alerts, and County Road 20 (Middle Fork Road) is open to all motorists.  <br />
<br />
The Malheur and Umatilla National Forests’ fire area closure remains in effect for areas east of FSR 45. However, the Forests’ will likely reduce the closure area within the next day or two. To <br />
stay informed about closure information, please continue checking: https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/malheur/notices/?cid=STELPRD3845529   <br />
<br />
Smoke may be visible to nearby communities and Forest visitors. Smoke and air quality impacts within the state can be monitored by visiting: http://oregonsmoke.blogspot.com <br />
<br />
The Malheur National Forest’s Public Use Restriction is Phase C on the Blue Mountain and Prairie City Ranger Districts. No campfires or personal chainsaw use is allowed. The Umatilla <br />
National Forest remains in Phase B, which allows campfires only in designated campgrounds and recreation sites. For more information, please go to: <br />
https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/malheur/fire, and  <br />
<br />
https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/umatilla/alerts-notices. <br />
<br />
Fire Danger remains Extreme for the surrounding area. The public can help us by making good decisions when they recreate on public lands and by following local fire restrictions.</span>

Highlights: Showers and thunderstorms lingered throughout the area most of Tuesday. Lower temperatures, higher relative humidity <br />
values, and precipitation resulted in minimal fire behavior. Containment of the Double Creek Fire increased to 22 percent. Crews on the <br />
Nebo Fire continued chipping along the 39 and 3925 Roads. Firefighters and heavy equipment worked on a shaded fuel break in the <br />
Lostine corridor. <br />
<br />
<br />
Double Creek Fire: 157,088 acres | 22% contained |842 personnel assigned  <br />
<br />
The lightning caused Double Creek Fire is a full suppression fire, and the protection of lives and property remain the primary objectives <br />
of this incident. Firefighters continued to work improve the containment line around the spot fire west bank of the Imnaha River but were <br />
unable to finish firing operations from indirect line on the north side of the spot fire due to the weather. Firefighters working in the Snake <br />
River patrolled the area looking for any remaining heat. The increase in containment occurred in this area, and firefighters anticipate <br />
more containment in the coming days. Today, firefighter on the northern end of the fire will add control features to limit fire spread to the <br />
north. Firefighters working in the Imnaha corridor on Wednesday will patrol along the western edge of the fire and address any hot <br />
spots. On the southern end of the fire, crews will continue to build a handline to the wilderness boundary. <br />
<br />
<br />
Eagle Cap Wilderness Fires  <br />
<br />
There are three lightning caused fires within the Eagle Cap Wilderness. The Nebo, Sturgill, and Goat Mountain 2 Fires are being <br />
managed to protect public and private infrastructure, while playing a natural role within designated Wilderness.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Nebo Fire: 12,563 acres | 0% contained | 55 personnel assigned<br />
<br />
Firefighters continued chipping along the 39 and 3925 Roads yesterday to remove available fuels. More than 2.5 miles of chipping has <br />
been completed. Today, crews will continue to chip the remaining three miles along the road system. Some resources will be <br />
reassigned to higher priority areas beginning today. <br />
<br />
<br />
Sturgill Fire: 20,036 acres | 0% contained | 75 personnel assigned <br />
<br />
Yesterday’s weather and poor flying conditions prevented two Smokejumper crews from being flown out of the Sturgill Fire. Firefighters <br />
and heavy equipment continued working on a shaded fuel break in the Lostine corridor. With improved flying conditions, Smokejumpers <br />
working on the Sturgill Fire will be flown from their work sites later today. Crews and heavy equipment will remain in the Lostine corridor <br />
to continue masticating fuels and creating a shaded fuel break. <br />
<br />
<br />
Goat Mountain 2 Fire: 535 acres | 0% contained | 0 personnel assigned<br />
<br />
Fire activity on the Goat Mountain 2 Fire is minimal. Firefighters will continue to monitor the fire by air as smoke and weather permit. <br />
<br />
<br />
Weather: Showers and thunderstorms lingered throughout the area most of Tuesday. Rain amounts varied from 0.10 – 0.50 inches <br />
across the four fires. Lower temperatures, higher relative humidity values, and precipitation resulted in minimal fire behavior. For the <br />
remainder of the week temperatures will continue to decrease and relative humidity values will increase. Winds will remain light and <br />
variable.</span>

Overview: The Goat Rocks Fire continues to burn 1.5 miles northeast of the town of Packwood, Washington in the Goat Rocks <br />
Wilderness area. The steep rugged terrain and dense stands of timber have challenged suppression efforts, but cooler weather <br />
conditions are now assisting fire crews in suppressing the fire. The Goat Rocks Wilderness is a congressionally designated area with <br />
special considerations in maintaining this unique location on the Gifford Pinchot National Forest. <br />
<br />
Community Meeting:  Today, September 14, beginning at 7:00 p.m., there will be a meeting held at the Packwood Community Hall, and <br />
broadcast on the Gifford Pinchot National Forest Facebook page. Fire officials will update the public on the current fire situation on the <br />
Goat Rocks Fire. <br />
<br />
Fire Activity: Firefighting personnel made good progress with their road clearing project today along the 1266 and the 46 road systems. <br />
Ahead of this clearing work crews were identifying locations where additional fire breaks could be constructed. Several engines <br />
patrolled around the area last night and finished out their last night shift. All resources will now be working days. <br />
<br />
Today, the road clearing work will continue along the 1266 and 46 roads using masticators, a machine that grinds brush from under the <br />
forest canopy leaving wood chips behind. A hand crew will be working along the northern boundary of the fire to identify areas where <br />
they can build direct line on the fire’s edge. Structure preparation will continue along US-12 and the structures around Packwood Lake. <br />
Crews are working to remove brush, vegetation and flammable materials from around those structures. <br />
<br />
Forest Closures:?US Hwy-12 and Highway 123 are both now open for traffic in both directions, but fire managers are asking the public <br />
to exercise caution on the roads as fire vehicles and personnel are operating in the area. Forest Roads 1260, 1262, 1266, 4600, 4610, <br />
4612, 4830 and all connected spur roads remain closed. Additionally, #65 (Bluff Lake), #69 (Three Peaks), #74 (Pipeline Road), #61 <br />
(Clear Fork Trail from the trailhead to the Clear Lost Trail), #76 (Clear Lost Trail from the junction of the Clear Fork Trail to the junction <br />
of the Packwood Lake Trail), and #78 (Packwood Lake Trail) are closed. Hikers can continue to access the Clear Lost Trailhead but can <br />
only hike south on the Clear Fork Trail.  <br />
<br />
Evacuations:?All of Packwood and its surrounding communities except for Upper Timberline are at an Evacuation Level 1 (Be Ready). <br />
Upper Timberline is now at an Evacuation Level 2 (Be Set).  <br />
<br />
Fire Restrictions:?Campfire bans and other use restrictions are in place across the Gifford Pinchot National Forest and much of the <br />
region. Campfires are allowed within certain campgrounds on an approved list at:  <br />
<br />
https://www.fs.usda.gov/alerts/giffordpinchot/alerts-notices <br />
<br />
Weather: After a couple of cloudy days, the clouds should break this afternoon bringing some sunshine back to the area. This sun will <br />
help drive some light winds along the terrain in the fire area. These light winds will be paired with a continuation of cool temps and a <br />
moist environment that should be conducive to minimal fire activity.  <br />
<br />
Public Safety:  Firefighters and heavy equipment are working on and around the area roadways. You can help keep firefighters and the <br />
public safe by driving carefully and by adhering to the closure orders until they are officially lifted.? <br />

Plain, WA – Lightning started the White River and Irving Peak Fires on August 11th. The Minnow Ridge Fire cause is undetermined. <br />
These fires are burning on the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest.<br />
<br />
Suppression Strategy – Due to rugged and steep terrain, fire managers continue to implement a long-term strategy to manage these <br />
fires, including the use of primary and contingency perimeter lines for containment. Tactics include completion and reinforcement of fire <br />
lines utilizing forest roads and constructed hand line.<br />
<br />
Current Situation – A local Type 3 Incident Management Team assumed command of the fires on September 7th and is currently <br />
managing the White River, Irving Peak, Meander, and now Minnow Ridge fires. The Meander Fire remains at 6 acres with very minimal <br />
fire activity. Smoke may be visible over the next several weeks as interior fuels continue to smolder and burn out, and multiple fires burn <br />
region-wide. Updates will be posted weekly unless significant new activity occurs.<br />
<br />
White River Fire – Acres: 3,184 (as of 9/13/2022); 5% contained; Location: Sears Creek area of the White River drainage, <br />
approximately 14 miles NW of Plain, WA.<br />
The fire area remains drier and more active along the southern edges. The fire footprint remains within the control lines, and geographic <br />
features being utilized as containment lines. Firefighters are working to establish an anchor point and maintain the structure protection <br />
along Sears Creek Road and Windmill Lane.<br />
<br />
Irving Peak Fire – Acres: 3,226 (as of 9/9/2022); 5% contained; Location: Approximately 16 miles NW of Plain, WA<br />
The Irving Peak Fire received some precipitation yesterday with minimal growth and fire activity. Firefighters continue to improve roads <br />
used as containment lines and monitor fire activity.<br />
<br />
Minnow Ridge Fire – Acres: 502 (as of 9/13/2022); 0% contained; Location: Chikamin Ridge, approximately 14 miles N of Plain, WA.<br />
Fire activity has been moderate and mainly consuming ground fuels. Firefighters continue scouting forest roads and fire lines previously <br />
utilized during past wildfire activity to determine if they may benefit the current fire suppression strategy.  <br />
<br />
Weather – A chance of showers exists over the fire area today, Wednesday, September 14th, with west winds around 6-8 mph. Cooler <br />
temperatures and higher relative humidity continue into later this week.<br />
<br />
Air Quality and Smoke – Current information about air quality and health recommendations during smoky conditions is available on the <br />
Washington Smoke Blog https://wasmoke.blogspot.com/<br />
<br />
Closures – An emergency closure issued by the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest remains in place and can be viewed here: <br />
www.fs.usda.gov/alerts/okawen/alerts-notices. The PCT remains open and is not directly impacted by these fires. Several trails in the <br />
Chikamin Ridge area are pending closure due to the Minnow Ridge Fire. Fire managers are asking people to please respect these <br />
closures while recreating in the area.<br />
<br />
Restrictions – Campfires are not allowed anywhere within the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest. Stage 2 Restrictions are now in <br />
effect for the entire forest, including campgrounds and wilderness areas: www.fs.usda.gov/detail/okawen/alerts-notices/?<br />
cid=fsbdev3_053600.<br />
<br />
Evacuations – Current Chelan County evacuation levels include a Level 2 evacuation (Be Prepared) for Sears Creek Road and Level 1 <br />
(Stay Alert) for White River Road and Little Wenatchee Road. www.co.chelan.wa.us/emergency-management/pages/active-<br />

						    <span class="textarea">Overview: The Kalama Fire, located southeast of Kalama Horse Camp on the south side of Mount St. Helens, is currently at <br />
approximately 112 acres in size.  This number of acres will be updated with better mapping from an infra-red flight once conditions allow <br />
the flight to occur.<br />
<br />
Fire Behavior: The fire was located on a cliff face and is now on extremely steep ground, fire fighters are preparing indirect lines in more <br />
favorable terrain where they can be successful.  Fire behavior has been smoldering and creeping. The potential for fire growth remains, <br />
but containment lines are being put in place and contain percentage information will be updated when the lines are complete and <br />
holding.<br />

						    <span class="textarea">Increased fire activity on some of the lightning caused fires, burning in the very remote, steep, and inaccessible terrain in the northwest <br />
corner of the Pasayten Wilderness Area, spurred trail and area closures over the holiday weekend. Hot, dry, and windy conditions are <br />
expected today as a trough moves into the area which is expected to create conditions for increased fire behavior. The Shull, The <br />
Parks, Kid, Three Fools, Skagit, and Elbow fires, located near the Canadian-U.S border, are expected to grow in acreage today.<br />
<br />
In a joint delegation with the National Park Service, a National Incident Management Organization Team, NIMO Team 2, assumed <br />
command yesterday over the six fires now being called the NW Pasayten Fires, located in the Pasayten Wilderness on the Methow <br />
Valley Ranger District of the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest, as well as the Chilliwack Complex Fires within the North Cascades <br />
National Park Service Complex.<br />
<br />
A number of closures are in effect including an area closure for the Freezeout Creek basin and a number of trails and portions of trails <br />
in the area. Portions of both the Pacific Crest Trail and Pacific Northwest Trail remain closed at this time.<br />
<br />
Smoke from these fires, and other fires burning in the region, may impact north central Washington communities over the next few <br />
days. Take precautions when recreating outdoors when heavy smoke is present. Learn more at Real-Time Air Quality Map | PurpleAir, <br />

<br />
Update on individual NW Pasayten Fires:<br />
•     The Kid Fire, located on the ridge between Rock Creek and West Fork Pasayten, is approximately 8 miles south of the Canadian-<br />
U.S. border. The fire has been very active with spotting and torching of grouped trees. Yesterday, smokejumpers worked on protection <br />
of the historic airport cabin, situated about one quarter mile away from the Kid Fire, utilizing pumps and sprinklers. If conditions allow, <br />
smokejumpers will also be burning out unburned brush between the fire and the cabin.<br />
•     The Parks Fire is also very active. It crossed the border into Canada a couple of days ago. There is a Canadian Incident <br />
Management Team assigned to the Canadian portion (called the Heather Fire north of the border) of the Parks Fire. The fire is about <br />
one half mile from the Monument 83 Fire Lookout at the time of this release. Firefighters have prepared the lookout by wrapping the <br />
base with fire protective wrap.<br />
•    The Skagit Fire, located in Freezeout Creek 6 miles south of the border, spread northward and crossed over the top of the ridge and <br />
down the other side.<br />
•     Three Fools Fire, located 8 miles south of the border, is actively backing down the ridge and through an old burn scar, it has spotted <br />
north of the ridge. <br />
•     The Elbow Fire, located 6 miles south of the border, is actively backing down the slope near Skagit Peak.<br />
•     Tuesday, fire activity increased on the Shull Fire located 11 miles south of the border.</span>

Evacuations, closures reduced near Rum Creek Fire <br />
<br />
MERLIN, Ore. – Fire personnel continue to make progress on the Rum Creek Fire. More residual heat is being mopped up near the <br />
fire’s edges. Cooler, more humid weather continues to moderate fire behavior. On the interior of the fire, flames are slowly burning <br />
through residual ground fuels. Yesterday, only one small flare-up required water dropped by a helicopter to cool it. <br />

Most of the hoses, pumps, and other equipment used for fire suppression have been pulled from fire lines and returned to the Incident <br />
Command Post near Merlin. Repair work is underway on many of the contingency lines and on some of the primary lines. Surplus <br />
personnel are being reassigned or sent home. <br />
<br />
As of Tuesday, September 13, Josephine County Sheriff’s Office has reduced or lifted all evacuation orders and notices for the vicinity. <br />
A section of Level 3 (GO NOW) east of the Rogue River and west of Hog Creek Road and Hog Creek has been downgraded to a Level <br />
2 (Get Set). All other evacuation notices have been lifted. Evacuation information by address can be found at <br />

<br />
Coordination between the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), Josephine County Parks and the Josephine County Sheriff allowed the <br />
reopening of some recreation sites along the Rogue River. Hog Creek County Park and Boat Ramp, Indian Mary Park and <br />
Campground, and Ennis Riffle County Park are open starting this morning. The Almeda County Park and Campground and Galice boat <br />
ramp are still closed.  <br />
<br />
The Reuben Mountain Road between Lower Grave Creek Road and Dutch Henry Road is open, but grading and other repair work is <br />
obstructing this road. The public is asked to stay off the Reuben Mountain Road until repair work is completed. <br />
<br />
The public is reminded to drive carefully on roads near the fire, including Galice Road. Fire personnel are actively working on the fire, <br />
creating heavy traffic on some roads. If you do not need to be in the fire area, please stay out. Avoid chipping operations. Please slow <br />
down, keep your eyes on the road, and yield to oversized vehicles.  <br />
<br />

at Galice Road; Lower Grave Creek Road at Angora Creek (Grays Ranch); Grave Creek Road at the bridge by Grave Creek Boat <br />
Ramp. Only residents (must show proof of residency) and permitted users will be allowed through. <br />
<br />
River status: The Rogue River is open to boating down to Ennis Riffle. Boats must pull out of the water at Indian Mary or Ennis Riffle <br />
County Park. The river is closed between Ennis Riffle and Grave Creek Boat Ramp due to fire activity and hazards. The Wild section of <br />
the Rogue River below Grave Creek will remain open unless fire conditions warrant closure. River status is determined on a day-to-day <br />
basis. Please call 541-471-6535 for more information regarding Rogue River permits. No new boating permits will be issued at this <br />
time.</span>

<br />
Klamath Falls, Ore. – Last night fire crews continued to use infrared cameras to identify areas of heat around the perimeter of the fire. <br />
They are mainly finding heat under juniper trees on the southern and western areas.<br />
<br />
Today is the last day the Oregon Department of Forestry’s Type 1 Incident Management Team will be in command of the fire. Transition <br />
to the local Type 4 team will happen tomorrow at noon. The objectives for the local team will remain the same. Multiple engines and <br />
crews will continue to mop up where it warrants.<br />
<br />
Weather today will be cooler and more humid. Gusty winds are expected in the late afternoon and early evening.<br />
<br />
Residential traffic is allowed in the fire area, but residents are encouraged to drive slowly and be aware of fire operation traffic as they <br />
travel through the fire. Bureau of Land Management lands in and around the fire area remain closed to the public.<br />
<br />
We would like to remind the public that Klamath and Lake counties are still in extreme fire danger. Human-cause fire stats are down this <br />
fire season, so please help your local resources by preventing anything that can spark a fire. Visit <br />
https://www.oregon.gov/odf/fire/pages/restrictions.aspx for fire restrictions in your area or areas you may be traveling to.  <br />
<br />
This will be the final fire update from the ODF IMT. The team would like to thank the cooperators and public for their support during the <br />
fire. Without local resources and support from the community our team would not have been as successful.</span>

						    <span class="textarea">White River and Irving Peak Fire Update<br />
September 14, 2022<br />
<br />
Plain, WA – Lightning started the White River and Irving Peak Fires on August 11th. The Minnow Ridge Fire cause is undetermined. <br />
These fires are burning on the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest.<br />
<br />
Suppression Strategy – Due to rugged and steep terrain, fire managers continue to implement a long-term strategy to manage these <br />
fires, including the use of primary and contingency perimeter lines for containment. Tactics include completion and reinforcement of fire <br />
lines utilizing forest roads and constructed hand line.<br />
<br />
Current Situation – A local Type 3 Incident Management Team assumed command of the fires on September 7th and is currently <br />
managing the White River, Irving Peak, Meander, and now Minnow Ridge fires. The Meander Fire remains at 6 acres with very minimal <br />
fire activity. Smoke may be visible over the next several weeks as interior fuels continue to smolder and burn out, and multiple fires burn <br />
region-wide. Updates will be posted weekly unless significant new activity occurs.<br />
<br />
White River Fire – Acres: 3,184 (as of 9/13/2022); 5% contained; Location: Sears Creek area of the White River drainage, <br />
approximately 14 miles NW of Plain, WA.<br />
The fire area remains drier and more active along the southern edges. The fire footprint remains within the control lines, and geographic <br />
features being utilized as containment lines. Firefighters are working to establish an anchor point and maintain the structure protection <br />
along Sears Creek Road and Windmill Lane.<br />
<br />
Irving Peak Fire – Acres: 3,226 (as of 9/9/2022); 5% contained; Location: Approximately 16 miles NW of Plain, WA<br />
The Irving Peak Fire received some precipitation yesterday with minimal growth and fire activity. Firefighters continue to improve roads <br />
used as containment lines and monitor fire activity.<br />
