<br />
A Red Flag Warning is in effect for this afternoon and evening. A Fire Weather Watch is in effect for Wednesday. <br />
A Red Flag Warning means that critical fire weather conditions are either occurring now or will occur shortly. <br />
Specifically, these conditions include continued warm temperatures, low humidity, and strong winds. Combined, <br />
they promote the rapid spread of wildfire and extreme fire behavior that could become life threatening.<br />
<br />
Out of an abundance of caution and at the recommendation of the Alaska Incident Management Team, Lake <br />
County expanded the Level 1 (Get Ready) evacuation boundary to include the area north of Summer Lake. The <br />
expanded area extends from Mile Post 73 on Highway 31 north to Picture Rock Pass and east of the highway to <br />
include the Ana Subdivision. A Level 2 (Be Set) evacuation remains in place from milepost 73 on Highway 31 <br />
south to Monument Rock. A Level 3 (GO NOW!) evacuation remains in place for all areas within and adjacent to <br />
the Bootleg Fire perimeter, including Yamsay Mountain, Thompson Reservoir, and the Sycan Marsh to the top of <br />
Winter Rim.  <br />
<br />
The Bootleg Fire containment continues to advance as firefighting crews mop up, improve fire line, and <br />
strengthen contingency lines. Crews are working tirelessly to ensure we are as prepared as we can be for the <br />
extreme fire weather forecast for the next couple days. <br />
<br />
Just as firefighters have been preparing for the weather conditions, you should, too. Fire starts are not just from <br />
escaped embers and lightning but can also come from a trailer chain dragged on pavement, a hot catalytic <br />
converter in contact with dry grasses, or shooting firearms. “Any accidental or negligent release of sparks or heat <br />
can result in a fire that quickly gets out of control,” says Kristian Knutson, Fire Prevention Officer in Palmer, <br />
Alaska, and incident Public Information Officer. “Be sure to remove combustibles from around the outside of your <br />
home, such as firewood, fuel tanks, and gas grills. Keep shrubs and tree limbs away from your house and off the <br />
ground.” At this time of year, one less spark could mean one less wildfire.</span>

Sweet Home, Oregon – Sweet Home, Oregon – This will be the last regular update. As there are any updates to <br />
fire progression or significant events, we will be releasing information on our Facebook and Inciweb page. <br />
<br />
Today, the South Cascade Interagency Type 3 Team continues to mop-up and strengthen contingency lines. <br />
Containment is at 65%. Crews will remain vigilant as weather conditions change.  A south and southwest wind <br />
will be over the Willamette National Forest today, which may result in thunderstorms near the fire starting in the <br />
afternoon and lasting through this evening. There is a possibility of gusty winds more than 40 mph. The <br />
combination of this with low humidity will result in critical fire weather conditions for the area today. The threat of <br />
thunderstorms will end Tuesday when afternoon temperatures will warm to around ten degrees above normal. <br />
Overnight relative humidity will likely be lower over the next couple of days. There will be a higher chance of <br />
showers and thunderstorms starting again on Thursday. Precipitation could occur Friday and Saturday but may <br />
end up north of the incident.  The Willamette National Forest will maintain its large closure area to prioritize <br />
safety of the public and firefighters. The BLM closure order for the Quartzville Backcountry Byway has been <br />
lifted. The Byway is now open to mile post 25, where the Forest Service closure begins. The BLM closure may <br />
be reactivated at any time as needs warrant.  Campfires are currently prohibited on Willamette National Forest <br />
land, as well as on BLM lands east of the I-5, including Quartzville Creek corridor. This includes dispersed sites <br />
and established campgrounds with fire pits. For the complete list of restrictions for WNF land, including the Bruler <br />
Fire closure map, please visit https://www.fs.usda.gov/alerts/willamette/alerts-notices. For information on <br />
restrictions for BLM land, visit https://www.blm.gov/orwafire.</span>

Winthrop, WA — The Cedar Creek and Delancy Fires are burning on the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest <br />
and public and private lands within Okanogan County. These fires are being managed by Great Basin Incident <br />
Management Team 1.<br />
<br />
Fire Weather: Residual moisture from Sunday's rain showers helped moderate fire behavior on Monday, but <br />
warm temperatures have returned. Today will be hotter and drier, with unstable air conditions in the afternoon. <br />
There is the potential for thundershowers over the fire area this afternoon and evening. Erratic outflow winds are <br />
possible.<br />

Public Meeting: A public meeting hosted by the Southwest Area and Great Basin IMTs was held yesterday <br />
evening at Mack Lloyd Park in Winthrop. The Incident Commander and Operations Section Chief for each team <br />
gave updates on their fires. Okanogan County Emergency Manager Maurice Goodall discussed evacuations. <br />
The teams had their Incident Meteorologist, Fire Behavior Analyst, Air Quality Specialist, and Medical Unit <br />
Leader on hand to answer questions. Representatives from the US Forest Service, Okanogan County Fire <br />
District 6, and Washington DNR were also present.<br />
<br />
A second public meeting will be held this evening, Tuesday, August 3, 2021, at 6 pm in Twisp River Park, 325 <br />
North Lincoln Street, Twisp.<br />
<br />
At 12:30 pm, firefighting helicopters lifted off but were forced to return to base because of poor visibility. By 2:00 <br />
pm, the skies cleared, and four firefighting helicopters went into service.<br />
<br />
Fire behavior picked up on Vasiliki Ridge, but firefighters were able to hold the fire in check. Helicopters <br />
supported crews on the ground with multiple bucket-drops of water. Today a Type 1 Sikorsky Skycrane helicopter <br />
will be used to drop fire retardant to reinforce the indirect line that has been constructed from near the Pine Fir <br />
Campground to the ridgetop.<br />
<br />
Wood chipping is complete in the Vasiliki Ridge – Silver Star Creek area. Four chipping crews with large <br />
commercial woodchippers are in service along WA-20, disposing of slash generated as firefighters worked to <br />
protect homes near the fire's edge. Chipping  is a critical piece of the work which must be completed in order to <br />
open WA-20 and as such is a very high priority.<br />
<br />
Firefighters continue to do mop-up and fall hazards trees along the WA-20 Corridor. A concentration of hazard <br />
trees (a snag patch) around Free Stone continues to be an area of concern. Hazard trees inside the perimeter <br />
could potentially fall over the line and provide a path for fire to escape. The snag patch is too dangerous for <br />
firefighters to enter, so crews are installing water sprinkler systems to mitigate spotting potential where snags <br />
threaten the line.<br />
<br />
Isolated areas of heat remain below Lucky Jim Bluff. Crews will continue to mop up the line and hope to be able <br />
to call this area contained in the near future.<br />
<br />
Along WA-20 where the fire perimeter is contained (black line on the map), excess equipment is being collected <br />
and returned to base (back-hauled). The hose brought back to fire camp will be straightened, rolled, and returned <br />
to a regional warehouse known as a cache, where it will be made ready for use on the next fire.<br />
<br />
Delancy Fire: Delancy fire remained within its current perimeter. Fire crews working in the Vasiliki Ridge – Silver <br />
Star Creek area were able to monitor the fire from their location. The estimated size of the Delancy Fire remains <br />
at 223 acres.</span>

<br />
Inchelium, Wa.—On Monday there was minimal fire growth. Crews made progress strengthening dozer and <br />
handlines in the Oregon Ridge area.<br />
<br />
Warm and dry conditions have prompted a Heat Advisory to be in place between 11:00 a.m. today and <br />
Wednesday night. An active fire day is expected. An approaching weather system has the potential to bring <br />
thunderstorms and erratic winds that could gust up to 35mph. This storm system is expected to pass through the <br />
fire area between this afternoon into the evening. These gusting and shifting winds can create challenging <br />
conditions on the ground for firefighters with the potential for torching, short crown runs, and quick rates of <br />
spread through dry grasses.<br />
<br />
Crews are building direct and indirect fire line along the fire’s north and east sides. Mop up and reinforcement <br />
continues to the west and on parts of the northern edge of the fire. Crews continue to prepare dozer line in the <br />
southeast and plan to use helicopters to drop water on the fire provided there is safe visibility.<br />
<br />
Fire managers are monitoring the approaching weather system closely. Dry conditions persist after minimal rain <br />
on Sunday. Everyone is asked to stay vigilant following fire restrictions and safety measures to prevent additional <br />
fires.<br />
<br />
The Chuweah Creek Fire is now 90% contained. Three engine crews remain to strengthen the northeast corner, <br />
with other resources now shifted to the Summit Trail Fire.<br />
<br />
Evacuations: Level 1 (Advisory) evacuations are in place for the area from Lafleur south on Hall Creek Road to <br />
Hall Creek Flat (including Lynx Creek Road), Seyler Valley Road south to Bridge Creek Road, and for residents <br />
along Bridge Creek Road (including Mollenberg Lane) to the edge of Twin Lakes. The Twin Lakes area remains <br />
under a Level 1 (Advisory) evacuation as well. A map of the evacuation area is available at <br />
incidweb.nwcg.gov/incidents/7677.<br />
<br />
Boating Exclusion: North Twin Lake and the channel are closed to boating. South Twin Lake remains open.<br />
<br />
Road closures: Sitdown Creek Road is closed at County Highway 99. Some recreation and parking areas may <br />
be closed to public access. Expect delays and please use caution when driving as firefighters will be working <br />
along the road.<br />
<br />
Closures: The Reservation is shut down to industrial activities and the general public. The Tribes have imposed <br />
an Industrial Fire Precaution Level IV general shutdown, which closes all forest roads to the public. State and <br />
county improved roads (with a paved or gravel surface) remain open.<br />

<br />
[John Day, Ore.]  Operations across the 159 acre Cottonwood Creek Fire have fully transitioned to mop-up work.  <br />
Hoselays have been completed, with water being distributed to all parts of the fire as needed.  Containment for <br />
the fire has increased to 40% as of late Monday afternoon.  The fire was ignited by lighting from a passing <br />
thunderstorm Thursday afternoon, but was not reported until mid-day Friday.  Dozers, wildland engines, <br />
helicopters and airtankers were successful in stopping forward growth of the fire by late Friday evening.<br />
<br />
Burning snags and “rollers” have concerned firefighters for the last several days as they worked to strengthen <br />
firelines and keep the fire within the original footprint.  “Rollers” are burning chunks of logs or other material that <br />
can ignite un-burned fuels as they roll down steep terrain.  These “rollers” and embers from the snags can create <br />
spotfires outside the fire’s edge.  The work completed by firefighters to mop-up and cool active areas of the fire, <br />
fall snags and widen the cold black adjacent to the dozer line has significantly mitigated the risk of the fire <br />
moving outside the fireline.  Firefighters will continue mop-up work on the fire, focusing on areas of active flames <br />
and gridding for heat near the fireline.<br />
<br />
The fire is being managed by a Type 3 organization from ODF’s Central Oregon District. Ten wildland engines, <br />
five hand crews, three water tenders, and additional overhead are assigned to the fire.  Local aircraft are <br />

<br />
A Regulated-Use Closure is in effect for the Central Oregon District to reduce human caused fires.  The closure <br />
restricts mowing of dried grass, cutting and grinding of metal, and chainsaw use between 10:00 a.m. and 8:00 <br />
p.m. as well as prohibiting campfires, cooking fires and warming fires.  The full proclamation and restrictions are <br />
available at https://gisapps.odf.oregon.gov/firerestrictions/PFR.html.  Industrial operations on forestland within <br />
the Central Oregon District also have restrictions in place.  Details for these activities are found at <br />
https://gisapps.odf.oregon.gov/firerestrictions/IFPL.html.  Preventing human caused fires allows firefighters to <br />
focus suppression effort on fires started by lightning.  These focused activities result in smaller fires with less <br />
damage to natural resources and communities and fewer impacts to air quality.<br />

The Methow Valley saw some relief from smoke impacts as the inversion lifted by early afternoon. As long term <br />
smoke will continue, we would like to encourage communities to refer to the air quality information resources for <br />
daily Air Quality Index’s (AQI) and provide guidance for preventative health measures.<br />
<br />
Yesterday firefighters progressed along FS Road 37 with heavy equipment as they worked to extend their <br />
containment features on the Eastern flank towards Baldy Pass. On FS Road 39 similar operations will continue <br />
as firefighters work north towards Tiffany Springs. Along the southern perimeter firefighters completed hose lays <br />
and dozer line down to Bear Creek in anticipation for any spread to the South. Today firefighters will continue to <br />
scout for additional containment features along ridge systems from Starvation Mountain up to Old Baldy. <br />
Containment lines on the west flank continue to hold as firefighters will be mopping up to Sweetgrass Butte. In <br />
the northern portion of the fire resources will be utilizing heavy equipment up the Chewuch River along FS Road <br />
51 to create a containment lines up to Farewell Creek. Resources within the Brevicomis summer homes will <br />
continue mop up operations and provide structure protection.<br />
<br />
Today at 6:00 pm a community meeting will be held in Twisp at Twisp River Park 325 North Lincoln St.<br />
<br />
Tonight’s meeting will have speakers from both incidents to provide information these events will also be <br />
streamed via Facebook.</span>

Winthrop, WA — The Cedar Creek and Delancy Fires are burning on the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest <br />
and public and private lands within Okanogan County. These fires are being managed by Great Basin Incident <br />
Management Team 1.<br />
<br />
Fire Weather: Residual moisture from Sunday's rain showers helped moderate fire behavior on Monday, but <br />
warm temperatures have returned. Today will be hotter and drier, with unstable air conditions in the afternoon. <br />
There is the potential for thundershowers over the fire area this afternoon and evening. Erratic outflow winds are <br />
possible.<br />
<br />
Public Meeting: A public meeting hosted by the Southwest Area and Great Basin IMTs was held yesterday <br />
evening at Mack Lloyd Park in Winthrop. The Incident Commander and Operations Section Chief for each team <br />
gave updates on their fires. Okanogan County Emergency Manager Maurice Goodall discussed evacuations. <br />
The teams had their Incident Meteorologist, Fire Behavior Analyst, Air Quality Specialist, and Medical Unit <br />
Leader on hand to answer questions. Representatives from the US Forest Service, Okanogan County Fire <br />
District 6, and Washington DNR were also present.<br />
<br />
A second public meeting will be held this evening, Tuesday, August 3, 2021, at 6 pm in Twisp River Park, 325 <br />
North Lincoln Street, Twisp.<br />
<br />
At 12:30 pm, firefighting helicopters lifted off but were forced to return to base because of poor visibility. By 2:00 <br />
pm, the skies cleared, and four firefighting helicopters went into service.<br />
<br />
Fire behavior pickedup on Vasiliki Ridge, but firefighters were able to hold the fire in check. Helicopters <br />
supported crews on the ground with multiple bucket-drops of water. Today a Type 1 Sikorsky Skycrane helicopter <br />
will be used to drop fire retardant to reinforce the indirect line that has been constructed from near the Pine Fir <br />
Campground to the ridgetop.<br />
<br />
Wood chipping is complete in the Vasiliki Ridge – Silver Star Creek area. Four chipping crews with large <br />
commercial woodchippers are in service along WA-20, disposing of slash generated as firefighters worked to <br />
protect homes near the fire's edge. Chipping  is a critical piece of the work which must be completed in order to <br />
open WA-20 and as such is a very high priority.<br />
<br />
Firefighters continue to do mop-up and fall hazards trees along the WA-20 Corridor. A concentration of hazard <br />
trees (a snag patch) around Free Stone continues to be an area of concern. Hazard trees inside the perimeter <br />
could potentially fall over the line and provide a path for fire to escape. The snag patch is too dangerous for <br />
firefighters to enter, so crews are installing water sprinkler systems to mitigate spotting potential where snags <br />
threaten the line.<br />
<br />
Isolated areas of heat remain below Lucky Jim Bluff. Crews will continue to mop up the line and hope to be able <br />
to call this area contained in the near future.<br />
<br />
Along WA-20 where the fire perimeter is contained (black line on the map), excess equipment is being collected <br />
and returned to base (back-hauled). The hose brought back to fire camp will be straightened, rolled, and returned <br />
to a regional warehouse known as a cache, where it will be made ready for use on the next fire.<br />
<br />
Delancy Fire: Delancy fire remained within its current perimeter. Fire crews working in the Vasiliki Ridge – Silver <br />
Star Creek area were able to monitor the fire from their location. The estimated size of the Delancy Fire remains <br />
at 223 acres.</span>

<br />
WALLOWA, Ore. – Due to the reduced complexity of the Elbow Creek Fire, Oregon Department of Forestry’s <br />
Type 1 Incident Management Team 3 will hand the fire over to a smaller Type 3 organization this morning <br />
(Tuesday, Aug. 3). The team would like to again thank the communities in the area for their kind hospitality and <br />
support during our stay.<br />
<br />
The forward spread of the fire has been stopped for several days and stands at 22,960 acres and 95% <br />
contained.<br />
<br />
The Type 3 organization will be working for the Umatilla and Wallowa-Whitman National Forests, the Vale District <br />
of the BLM and the Northeast Oregon District of the Oregon Department of Forestry.<br />
<br />
The main responsibility of the new team will be to complete any remaining mop-up, patrol the perimeter, <br />
backhaul fire cache supply such as hose, pumps and portable water tanks, and continue suppression repair <br />
work.     <br />
<br />
The fire camp located at the Stampede Grounds in Elgin will be shut down. All personnel working the south end <br />
of the fire will be working out of the main fire camp located about three miles up Promise Road from Highway 82. <br />
A spike camp for crews working on the north end of the fire will be located on the 62 road at Fry Meadow Seed <br />
Orchard.<br />
<br />
Resources working under the team will include eight 20-person crews, nine engines, four water tenders, four <br />
dozers and 2 excavators.<br />
<br />
Information sources will remain in place for the Elbow Creek Fire, including Facebook and Inciweb. News <br />
updates about the fire will be provided as needed. Additional information can be obtained by calling (541) 805-<br />
2784 Monday through Friday 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.</span>

There will be community meeting this Wednesday night at the Dayton Best Western Conf. Room @ 7:30 p.m.<br />
<br />
Lick Creek Fire: The Burn Area Emergency Response (BAER) Team assessment will be utilized for forecasting <br />
the preparation needs of the areas at greatest risk for runoff and flooding. Continued smoke will be visible as <br />
unburned pockets of vegetation inside the fire perimeter are consumed. Crews will continue to mop-up any <br />
interior pockets of heat and patrol until full containment is achieved. This fire remains at 90% contained.<br />
<br />
Green Ridge Fire: The fire continued backing slowly toward the Tucannon River in the Ladybug Campground <br />
area holding within primary containment lines. The night shift focused on patrol and monitoring of the fire edge <br />
taking action where needed to accomplish containment. <br />
<br />
Today’s operations may include firing along the 46 Road that will connect the Edmiston Springs and Spangler <br />
Creek sections. Aircraft will be assisting ground resources with retardant and water dropping runs to help <br />
minimize potential for additional fire spread, working the strategy of anchor and flanking. It will be warmer today <br />
with temperatures in the 70’s along the ridges and 90’s in the valley bottoms. Every effort is being made to <br />
protect the numerous values at risk to include Mill Creek Municipal Watershed, plantation reforestation sites, <br />
sensitive plants, recreation areas, fisheries, numerous cultural, archaeological, and historic sites, farming, high <br />
value agricultural lands, a RAWS site, and a repeater site are also threatened. Secondary control lines continue <br />
to be worked by improvement of existing roads, trails, and natural terrain features.</span>

Firefighters spent much of Monday locating and combating new lightning starts in and around the Jack Fire and <br />
Rough Patch Complex and expect to continue today, fire officials said. “We had quite a day today – very active, <br />
very busy with new starts,” said John Spencer, operations chief for Northwest Incident Management Team 13 <br />
under Brian Gales, which is now managing the Jack Fire, Rough Patch Complex and initial attack for new starts <br />
in the area. “There’s still more work to do and we expect more things to pop, but overall we had great <br />
successes.”<br />
<br />
A morning reconnaissance flight identified 15 new lightning starts resulting from thunderstorms moving through<br />
the area Sunday evening. Fire crews began suppression efforts on six of those starts Monday and will begin<br />
addressing the remaining fires today.<br />
<br />
Four starts were successfully contained in and around the southern end of the Jack Fire<br />
(https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/7605/) and work will continue today on three others. Unsafe conditions<br />
created by standing dead trees and steep ground in the Copeland Creek drainage forced crews to disengage <br />
and identify strategies for addressing the eighth ignition, which they will implement today as well.<br />
Fire managers will be reassessing the overall objectives for the Jack Fire today due to the locations of these new<br />
starts. The fire footprint remains at 23,002.<br />
<br />
On the Rough Patch Complex (https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/7758/), crews continued working along the 3821<br />
Road and the 130 spur near Little Rock staging area to connect the southernmost containment line and <br />
preparing line along the 650 Road in the Chimney Rock area and the 3820 Road from the east.<br />
The complex, located 26 miles east of Cottage Grove between Tiller and Glide, was designated July 29 to <br />
address multiple lightning starts. A total of 17 fires had burned about 429 acres as of Monday evening.<br />
Fire managers are working with private landowners and timber companies to coordinate the removal of logging<br />
equipment and some log decks located within the complex and strategize protection measures for other <br />
stockpiles. Warm weather will continue today and Wednesday, with temperatures in the upper 90s at low <br />
elevations (2500 ft.) and 80s at high elevations (4000 ft.). Relative humidity will be in the teens with a 10 percent <br />
chance of thunderstorms. Thursday, winds will range from about 6 to 8 mph out of the southeast, with gusts <br />
around 13 mph.<br />
<br />
Closures: The Umpqua National Forest’s Horseshoe Bend Campground remains closed.</span>

There will be community meeting this Wednesday night at the Dayton Best Western Conf. Room @ 7:30 p.m.<br />
<br />
Lick Creek Fire: The Burn Area Emergency Response (BAER) Team assessment will be utilized for forecasting <br />
the preparation needs of the areas at greatest risk for runoff and flooding. Continued smoke will be visible as <br />
unburned pockets of vegetation inside the fire perimeter are consumed. Crews will continue to mop-up any <br />
interior pockets of heat and patrol until full containment is achieved. This fire remains at 90% contained.<br />
<br />
Green Ridge Fire: The fire continued backing slowly toward the Tucannon River in the Ladybug Campground <br />
area holding within primary containment lines. The night shift focused on patrol and monitoring of the fire edge <br />
taking action where needed to accomplish containment. <br />
<br />
Today’s operations may include firing along the 46 Road that will connect the Edmiston Springs and Spangler <br />
Creek sections. Aircraft will be assisting ground resources with retardant and water dropping runs to help <br />
minimize potential for additional fire spread, working the strategy of anchor and flanking. It will be warmer today <br />
with temperatures in the 70’s along the ridges and 90’s in the valley bottoms. Every effort is being made to <br />
protect the numerous values at risk to include Mill Creek Municipal Watershed, plantation reforestation sites, <br />
sensitive plants, recreation areas, fisheries, numerous cultural, archaeological, and historic sites, farming, high <br />
value agricultural lands, a RAWS site, and a repeater site are also threatened. Secondary control lines continue <br />
to be worked by improvement of existing roads, trails, and natural terrain features.</span>

The Nelson Creek Fire started on Friday, July 23, 2021. The fire was a result of a structure fire that burned <br />
quickly upslope and into the adjacent wildlands. The Southern Area Incident Management Gray Team, led by <br />
Incident Commander Mitch Ketron, assumed command of the fire on July 23, 2021. <br />
<br />
Advisories<br />
<br />
Do not fly drones over the fire. If you fly, we can't.<br />
Please respect road closure. Traffic on closed roads creates safety hazards for firefighters and emergency <br />
vehicles.<br />
Firefighting resources are extremely limited. It is critically important that we all do our part to prevent additional <br />
fire starts by following all restrictions and fire-related closures.</span>

<br />
Firefighters spent much of Monday locating and combating new lightning starts in and around the Jack Fire and <br />
Rough Patch Complex and expect to continue today, fire officials said. “We had quite a day today – very active, <br />
very busy with new starts,” said John Spencer, operations chief for Northwest Incident Management Team 13 <br />
under Brian Gales, which is now managing the Jack Fire, Rough Patch Complex and initial attack for new starts <br />
in the area. “There’s still more work to do and we expect more things to pop, but overall we had great <br />
successes.”<br />
<br />
A morning reconnaissance flight identified 15 new lightning starts resulting from thunderstorms moving through<br />
the area Sunday evening. Fire crews began suppression efforts on six of those starts Monday and will begin<br />
addressing the remaining fires today.<br />
<br />
Four starts were successfully contained in and around the southern end of the Jack Fire<br />
(https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/7605/) and work will continue today on three others. Unsafe conditions<br />
created by standing dead trees and steep ground in the Copeland Creek drainage forced crews to disengage <br />
and identify strategies for addressing the eighth ignition, which they will implement today as well.<br />
Fire managers will be reassessing the overall objectives for the Jack Fire today due to the locations of these new<br />
starts. The fire footprint remains at 23,002.<br />
<br />
On the Rough Patch Complex (https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/7758/), crews continued working along the 3821<br />
Road and the 130 spur near Little Rock staging area to connect the southernmost containment line and <br />
preparing line along the 650 Road in the Chimney Rock area and the 3820 Road from the east.<br />
The complex, located 26 miles east of Cottage Grove between Tiller and Glide, was designated July 29 to <br />
address multiple lightning starts. A total of 17 fires had burned about 429 acres as of Monday evening.<br />
Fire managers are working with private landowners and timber companies to coordinate the removal of logging<br />
equipment and some log decks located within the complex and strategize protection measures for other <br />
stockpiles. Warm weather will continue today and Wednesday, with temperatures in the upper 90s at low <br />
elevations (2500 ft.) and 80s at high elevations (4000 ft.). Relative humidity will be in the teens with a 10 percent <br />
chance of thunderstorms. Thursday, winds will range from about 6 to 8 mph out of the southeast, with gusts <br />
around 13 mph.<br />
<br />
Closures: The Umpqua National Forest’s Horseshoe Bend Campground remains closed.</span>

<br />
Wellpinit, WA – The Sherwood fire is 90% contained after crews continued to mop up residual hot spots with the <br />
help of the two palm-infrared cameras. A palm-infrared operator was able to complete an entire loop around the <br />
perimeter and a second loop was initiated. The containment percentage is expected to increase as crews finalize <br />
work on the southern edge of the fire.<br />
<br />
Smoke from neighboring fires will remain in the area with cloud coverage decreasing throughout the day. <br />
Temperatures are predicted to rise into the 90’s again and hot, dry conditions will persist through Wednesday. <br />
Visit https://fire.airnow.gov/ for current smoke patterns and air quality information. <br />
<br />
The Spokane Indian Reservation continues to be in EXTREME fire danger and precautions should be taken to <br />
avoid creating sparks or new fire starts. Community members can help prevent wildfires by taking precautionary <br />
actions at home while working with motorized tools, such as limiting the use of lawn mowers to the early morning <br />
or late evening, and never mowing dry grass.<br />
<br />
Northwest Team 6 will transition with a local Type 4 team at 0700 on Tuesday, August 3. This will be the last daily <br />
update from this team. Northwest Team 6 Incident Command Shawn Sheldon would like to thank the community <br />
for their outstanding support on behalf of the team and the firefighters.</span>

Colville, WA: Yesterday: Alpha Division (north of Highway 20), having been turned back over to the local agency <br />
representatives for DNR, continued under a patrol status. No new hot spots of issues where discovered. <br />
Firefighters on Division Zulu (south side of Highway 20) continued with their mop up operations which included <br />
gridding the fire to look for hot spots and making sure everything is out and cooled off. Palm infrared tools are <br />
being used to point out any additional hot spots firefighters can’t see with the naked eye. Hose lines were laid on <br />
the north side of the fire. Containment was achieved for 85% of the 130 acres fire. All evacuation notices are <br />
lifted for the area. <br />
<br />
Today: Firefighters will continue to patrol Division Zulu and will continue securing the containment line on the <br />
south and north end. They will continue repair work and the chipping operation. Repair work is part of our turn <br />
back standards (turning the fire back to local resources). This includes repairing any fences, roads or anything <br />
else that was destroyed during the firefighting efforts for access or containment during initial attack. There are <br />
104 firefighters on the ground with heavy equipment assisting with repair and containment lines.<br />
<br />
Northeast Washington Interagency Incident Management Team Type 3 Team 2 will transfer command of the <br />
Spruce Canyon Fire back to the local agencies at 6:00 am Tuesday, August 3, 2021. A Type 4 Incident <br />
management Team made up of local resources will take over the fire. As crews near full containment of the fire, <br />
fuel will continue to burn within the interior, although they are not expected to spread outside the perimeter of the <br />
containment lines. The public may notice some smoke within the perimeter over the next several days. <br />
Firefighters will continue to work to mop up all hot spots inside the fire area which is a safe distance in from the <br />
containment line.<br />
<br />
Resources will continue the demobilization process to return home or to be allocated to another fire today as <br />
containment continues to progress.<br />
<br />
Signs are on the highway informing drivers about firefighting vehicles coming on and off the highway. Citizens <br />
are asked to stay clear of the fire area and adhere to road signs. Driving with care will keep both drivers and <br />
firefighters safe.<br />
 <br />
While we appreciate the outpouring of generosity, there are no current needs for donations for the firefighting <br />
efforts.  Individuals who want to donate items should contact their local food pantries or local charities.<br />
<br />
The Spruce Canyon Fire started Friday, July 23. 2021 at 2:02 p.m. near Spruce Canyon Rd. and Black Lake. The <br />

fire area between this afternoon into the evening. These gusting and shifting winds can create challenging <br />
conditions on the ground for firefighters with the potential for torching, short crown runs, and quick rates of <br />
spread through dry grasses.<br />
<br />
Crews are building direct and indirect fire line along the fire’s north and east sides. Mop up and reinforcement <br />
continues to the west and on parts of the northern edge of the fire. Crews continue to prepare dozer line in the <br />
southeast and plan to use helicopters to drop water on the fire provided there is safe visibility.<br />
<br />
Fire managers are monitoring the approaching weather system closely. Dry conditions persist after minimal rain <br />
on Sunday. Everyone is asked to stay vigilant following fire restrictions and safety measures to prevent additional <br />
fires.<br />
<br />
The Chuweah Creek Fire is now 90% contained. Three engine crews remain to strengthen the northeast corner, <br />
with other resources now shifted to the Summit Trail Fire.<br />
<br />
Evacuations: Level 1 (Advisory) evacuations are in place for the area from Lafleur south on Hall Creek Road to <br />
Hall Creek Flat (including Lynx Creek Road), Seyler Valley Road south to Bridge Creek Road, and for residents <br />
along Bridge Creek Road (including Mollenberg Lane) to the edge of Twin Lakes. The Twin Lakes area remains <br />
under a Level 1 (Advisory) evacuation as well. A map of the evacuation area is available at <br />
incidweb.nwcg.gov/incidents/7677.<br />
<br />
Boating Exclusion: North Twin Lake and the channel are closed to boating. South Twin Lake remains open.<br />
<br />
Road closures: Sitdown Creek Road is closed at County Highway 99. Some recreation and parking areas may <br />
be closed to public access. Expect delays and please use caution when driving as firefighters will be working <br />
along the road.<br />
<br />
Closures: The Reservation is shut down to industrial activities and the general public. The Tribes have imposed <br />
an Industrial Fire Precaution Level IV general shutdown, which closes all forest roads to the public. State and <br />
county improved roads (with a paved or gravel surface) remain open.<br />
