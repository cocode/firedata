<br />
Crews will continue to mop-up and work on suppression repair in all divisions today. The fire remains at 85% <br />
containment and that number is expected to increase in the days ahead. The Type 2 Incident Command <br />
Team, Northwest 6 will be transitioning the fire to a local Type 3 Team tomorrow, August 25 at 7:00 am.<br />
<br />
Suppression efforts on the Black Butte fire were successful due to a lot of hard work from many partners and <br />
firefighters. The fire began after a lightning strike and quickly spread due to steep terrain, extremely dry fuels, <br />
and weather. Over time, the fire interacted with over 90 fuels treatments (prescribed burns, pile burns, slash <br />
clean up and thinning projects) slowing its forward progress. With the advantage of the pre-existing fuel <br />
treatments and moderate wind, firefighters were able to initiate offensive strategies to increase containment.<br />
<br />
Fire danger continues to be extreme on the Malheur National Forest and surrounding areas and fire <br />
restrictions are in place. Please remember to use caution while visiting public lands. Propane stoves and <br />
lanterns are permitted, but no open flames or campfires are allowed.<br />
<br />
Recreation Sites within the closure boundary: North Fork Malheur River Trailheads both north and south, <br />
North Fork Malheur Campground, Crane Crossing Trailheads both east and west, Short Creek Guard Station, <br />
Elk Creek Campground, Sunshine Flat Trailhead and Trail, Horseshoe Trailhead and Trail, Sheep Creek Trail <br />
and Trailhead, Little Crane Campground.<br />
<br />
Currently the Trout Farm and Crescent Campgrounds are still open to the public.<br />

<br />
Yesterday, the Bull Complex grew approximately 774 acres.  It’s burning closer to constructed containment lines <br />
on the south end of the fire, along Forest Road 4696 and Elk Lake Creek where firefighters have been creating <br />
multiple strategic locations to intercept the main fire when it reaches them.   Experienced fire crews, unmanned <br />
aircraft and helicopters have strategically burned small areas between the main fire and containment lines over <br />
past few days to remove fuel ahead of the main fire.  The south end of the fire is where firefighters are focused <br />
most to establish access into the fire’s edge.  <br />
<br />
Within the 43 total miles of fire perimeter, significant portions of the fire’s perimeter are currently difficult to <br />
access and present multiple safety hazards for ground forces. Hazards include steep and rugged terrain, large <br />
rolling rocks and logs, high densities of heavy timber and dead trees. Nationally, falling trees remain one of <br />
highest causes of firefighter deaths and injury in the wildland fire service. Additionally, adequate and safe ingress <br />
and egress routes are minimal, making it difficult for firefighters to rapidly move if the fire were to threaten their <br />
location. <br />
<br />
On the north, east, and west sides of the fire, the fire is burning slow and steady while it moves closer to the <br />
2020 Beachie Creek and Lionshead Fire burn areas that lack available fuels and roads being widened and <br />
brushed-out by heavy equipment, wood-chippers, and chainsaw teams. These indirect lines, occurring away <br />
from the fire’s edge, will eventually increase the probability of success and will be safer for firefighters working <br />
along the fire perimeter when the main fire reaches those locations in future days.  <br />
<br />
Closures:  For the safety of wildland firefighters and the public, the National Forests have enacted area closures <br />
that prevent the public from being upon National Forest System lands in the vicinity of the Bull Complex where <br />
uncontrolled fire and fire suppression activities are occurring. All Forest lands that are south and west of Forest <br />
Road 46, and east of the Riverside Fire perimeter are closed. The entire length of Forest Road 46 is closed. The <br />
lands within the 2020 Lionshead and Beachie Creek Fire areas are also closed.  See the closure orders and <br />
maps at https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/closures/7773/. <br />
<br />
Contractors approved by the Forest Service through a permit system are allowed through the closure order, as <br />
are vendors and others working on recovery efforts related to the 2020 area fires.  Breitenbush Hot Springs <br />
Resort is open; however, reservations are required to pass through a roadblock on Forest Road 46. <br />

Yesterday on the Bulldog Mountain fire, chipping of fuels along the northeast edge continued. Firefighters <br />
patrolled and took actions to hold the remainder of the fire within containment lines. <br />
<br />
Work will continue today to chip woody material and remove dangerous snags along the South Boulder Road. <br />
Firefighters expect to complete chipping along the 800 Road on the east side of the Mack fire in the next two <br />
days. This work will prepare the road as a fire line in the event that the fire moves out of its current footprint. <br />
<br />
Cloudy weather helped to moderate fire behavior yesterday. Today, slightly cooler and windier weather is <br />
expected as a cold front passed over the area last night. Even with these conditions, smoke may be visible as <br />
the fire continues to back down to the South Boulder Creek road.  <br />
<br />
Citizens should remain vigilant and are strongly encouraged to sign up for alerts at  Ferry County Alerts.  <br />
Motorists traveling on Boulder Hwy and SR395 should watch for heavy equipment and firefighters turning off and <br />
onto the roadway. Firefighter and public safety is our number one priority.  <br />
<br />
Smoke: Current weather conditions will moderate smoke impacts throughout the area today.  <br />
<br />
Closures: An area closure is in effect on Colville National Forest lands in the vicinity of the Bulldog Mountain Fire. <br />
For more information on area and road closures on the Colville National Forest, please visit: <br />
https://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fseprd938379.pdf <br />
<br />
Citizens are asked to stay clear of the fire area and comply with area closures.  <br />
<br />
While current weather conditions provide respite from the extreme fire potential present in northeast Washington, <br />
the forest can quickly dry out again in the many weeks of fire season ahead. Please continue to do all you can to <br />
prevent wildfires. <br />
<br />
The Incident Command Post is located in Inchelium, WA. A spike camp will remain in place in Kettle Falls, WA to <br />
support the Bulldog Mountain and Mack Mountain Fires.</span>

Cedar Creek Fire: The fire is 55,187 acres and 80% contained. Mop up continues in areas burning near the edge <br />
of the fire to further secure the containment line. Abernathy Ridge on the southwest part of the fire is being <br />
monitored from the air due to steep, inaccessible terrain. Hot spots are present well inside the fire, but these do <br />
not pose a threat to the line. Helicopter water drops will be used as needed to cool areas near the fire’s edge to <br />
assist ground crews securing containment lines. Hand line and dozer lines will be evaluated for repair needs.<br />
<br />
Cub Creek 2 Fire: The Cub Creek 2 Fire is 70,186 acres and 70% contained. Crews are patrolling and mopping <br />
up hot areas to secure the fire’s edge, including chipping of large, unburned vegetation. Crews continue to look <br />
near cabins and along interior roads for hazard trees and hot pockets of burning vegetation. Hazard trees are <br />
being removed in Forest Service campgrounds. Opportunities to mitigate damage caused by suppression, such <br />
as dozer and hand lines, are being identified and prioritized for repair. Excavators are being used for suppression <br />
repair work.<br />
<br />
Delancy Fire: The Delancy Fire is being monitored by arial surveillance and remains at 223 acres and 95% <br />
containment.<br />
<br />
Fire Weather: Showers occurred over peaks and higher elevations last night. Today will be sunny and breezy <br />
with moderate and gusty northwest winds and cooler temperatures. A warming trend will happen over the <br />
weekend. Resources for additional information: Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/MazamaFires2021, <br />

<br />
Closures: For the safety of the firefighters and aircraft fighting these fires, a temporary flight restriction (TFR) has <br />
been placed over the area. Please consult the “Notice to Airmen” (NOTAM) at FAA.gov for specifics.<br />
Wildfires are a “No Drone Zone” and any drone sighting in a TFR will lead to the immediate grounding of aerial <br />
firefighting resources and delay suppression actions. The following trails are currently closed: Cedar Creek Trail, <br />
Driveway Butte Trail, Lone Fire Trail, Cutthroat NRT Trail, and Wolf Creek Trail. The Okanogan-Wenatchee <br />
National Forest has implemented a Fire Emergency Area Closure as of July 22, 2021. The Closure includes <br />
facilities, roads, and trails. The Closure may be viewed in its entirety at the “Cedar Creek and Delancy Fires <br />
2021” Facebook page or https://www.fs.usda.gov/okawen. Fire Restrictions: Campfire restrictions are in effect. <br />
Campfires are prohibited throughout the Okanogan- Wenatchee National Forest, including developed <br />
campgrounds and congressionally designated Wilderness. Call local ranger district offices for more information.<br />
<br />
Fire Restrictions Information: https://www.fs.usda.gov/alerts/okawen/alerts-notices. Driving in the area: <br />
Communities in the fire area are currently open. Visitors and local residents are encouraged to exercise caution <br />
when driving in the area. Smoke will reduce visibility and increase the potential for accidents. Use headlights <br />
when driving in smoke and please stay focused on the road. Drivers are urged to exercise caution with school <br />
now in session. Displaced wildlife is moving around lower elevations as well.</span>

The Chickadee Creek Fire is located approximately 15 miles west of Tonasket, Washington. The Walker Creek <br />
Fire is located approximately 13 miles east/northeast of Tonasket, Washington, surrounding Lake Bonaparte. The <br />
Incident Command Post is being established at the Omak Stampede Grounds and is closed to all but essential <br />
personnel to help ensure the health and safety of community members and firefighters. Both fires received <br />
limited precipitation last night, and temperatures will be 60 to 70 degrees today.<br />
<br />
Helicopters used water buckets to minimize fire behavior around the Chickadee Creek Fire perimeter yesterday, <br />
and helped crews secure an area of fire that crossed containment lines on the northeastern fire edge. Fire crews <br />
continue to increase the depth of containment lines and to install hose lays to allow water delivery to areas of <br />
heat and smoldering fuels on the west side of the Chickadee Creek Fire.</span>

Cedar Creek Fire: The fire is 55,187 acres and 80% contained. Mop up continues in areas burning near the edge <br />
of the fire to further secure the containment line. Abernathy Ridge on the southwest part of the fire is being <br />
monitored from the air due to steep, inaccessible terrain. Hot spots are present well inside the fire, but these do <br />
not pose a threat to the line. Helicopter water drops will be used as needed to cool areas near the fire’s edge to <br />
assist ground crews securing containment lines. Hand line and dozer lines will be evaluated for repair needs.<br />
<br />
Cub Creek 2 Fire: The Cub Creek 2 Fire is 70,186 acres and 70% contained. Crews are patrolling and mopping <br />
up hot areas to secure the fire’s edge, including chipping of large, unburned vegetation. Crews continue to look <br />
near cabins and along interior roads for hazard trees and hot pockets of burning vegetation. Hazard trees are <br />
being removed in Forest Service campgrounds. Opportunities to mitigate damage caused by suppression, such <br />
as dozer and hand lines, are being identified and prioritized for repair. Excavators are being used for suppression <br />
repair work.<br />
<br />
Delancy Fire: The Delancy Fire is being monitored by arial surveillance and remains at 223 acres and 95% <br />
containment.<br />
<br />
Fire Weather: Showers occurred over peaks and higher elevations last night. Today will be sunny and breezy <br />
with moderate and gusty northwest winds and cooler temperatures. A warming trend will happen over the <br />
weekend. Resources for additional information: Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/MazamaFires2021, <br />

<br />
The Devil's Knob Complex is a group of lightning-caused fires on the Tiller Ranger District of the Umpqua <br />
National Forest and private lands protected by Douglas Forest Protective Association and the Cow Creek Band <br />
of the Umpqua Tribe of Indians.  <br />
<br />
Smith Fire (15,214 acres): Firefighters are building control lines and implementing strategic firing operations on <br />
all sides as weather and resources allow. Crews are prioritizing Ash Valley on the fire’s southeast edge, where <br />
two engine task forces from Douglas and Linn counties through the Office of Oregon State Fire Marshall as well <br />
as resources from Douglas Forest Protective Association are working to protect structures in that area. Homes in <br />
the community are now plumbed with hose lays and sprinkler systems. <br />
<br />
On the south side, crews are mopping up recent spot fires and previous burn operations. Along the fire’s <br />
northwest side, firefighters are using dozers to build indirect line for future strategic firing operations, and crews <br />
continue to prepare roads for future use as firelines along the perimeter. Additional air resources also have been <br />
brought in to provide support as conditions allow. <br />
<br />
Big Hamlin Fire (13,417 acres): Firefighters are working to build firelines and implement other control strategies <br />
as the fire shows relatively slow growth to the east and south. Containment lines along the western perimeter are <br />
holding well. Crews are continuing strategic firing operations along the southeastern edge moving north from <br />
Fawn Creek toward Whiskey Creek as conditions allow.  <br />
<br />
Dismal Creek, Little Applegate, Mule Creek, Section 30 (Railroad) and Wild Cat fires (1,489 total acres): These <br />
fires are containedand remain in patrol status. <br />
<br />
Weather: Winds have been flowing from the northwest but are anticipated to switch to a northeasterly flow today <br />
with gusts of 10-20 mph, which could test control lines along the western perimeter of the complex. <br />
Temperatures are anticipated to hover in the 70s and 80s through the weekend, with increasingly dry conditions <br />
likely contributing to some increase in fire activity.   <br />
<br />
Air Quality: Check latest conditions on the Oregon Smoke Information Blog: http://oregonsmoke.blogspot.com. <br />
<br />
Aviation Operations: The Incident Management Team is establishing a helibase near Days Creek to better <br />
support firefighting efforts. For the safety of firefighters and aircraft fighting the Devil’s Knob Complex, a <br />
temporary flight restriction remains in place over the fire area. Wildfires are also a “No Drone Zone.” <br />
<br />

<br />
Announcement: Evacuations are still in place for the Ford Corkscrew Fire. Please refer to the map on Inciweb at <br />
https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/7803/ or Stevens County Sheriff’s Office Facebook page. If you have <br />
questions, please call the fire information phone lines above. Please note, the reduction in acres is due to better <br />
data on containment line locations. As containment line and fire edge confirmations are received from field <br />
personnel, further adjustments in acreage are expected. <br />
<br />
Overview: The Ford Corkscrew Fire showed moderate fire behavior yesterday along the north and east flanks <br />
and within the interior. Firing operations took place along the norther perimeter as gusty winds supported <br />
torching and spotting while consuming unburned pockets of fuel within the fire area. Yesterday, firefighters <br />
responded to fire that crossed control lines along the northern perimeter. Hand crews and aerial resources (Fire <br />
Bosses) took immediate action to catch the fire and crews will continue monitoring that area and work to secure <br />
the line. Increasing relative humidity and cooler temperatures will slow fire spread and reduce fire activity. <br />
<br />
Fire Update: During yesterday’s operational period for the Ford Corkscrew Fire, resources continued to construct <br />
direct and indirect containment line and conduct point protection near values at risk. Firing operations occurred in <br />
some areas, including near the northern perimeter (Division Foxtrot) to remove unburned fuel between the fire <br />
edge and constructed control lines. Crews continued mop up activities, patrolled containment lines, worked to <br />
secure interior unburned islands.  <br />
<br />
Crews have made significant progress on the Ford Corkscrew Fire and will continue to scout and construct direct <br />
fire line along unsecured areas of the perimeter where safe to do so. Fire will continue to work through interior <br />
pockets of unburned fuels, increasing smoke activity. In areas of completed line, resources in all divisions will <br />
monitor activities and conduct mop up operations, provide point protection where needed and continue to identify <br />
suppression repair needs. Crews will also continue utilizing infrared monitors to identify and secure unburned <br />
islands around structures, including in Rail Canyon.  <br />
<br />
For structure status information, please email your name, contact information, and address of the property you <br />
are inquiring about to 2021.fordcorkscrew@firenet.gov or call 509-508-3311 between the hours of 8am and 8pm <br />
PDT. An agency representative from the Stevens County Fire District 1 will contact you as soon as possible. <br />
<br />
Weather: A sharp disturbance tracked across the Ford Corkscrew Fire last night through this morning, resulting in <br />
increased clouds and isolated rain showers to the areas around the fire. Fire weather conditions today will be <br />
moderated with cooler temperatures, higher relative humidity, and lighter winds. The current weather system will <br />
exit midday to bring clearing conditions and a return of more sunshine. For the weekend ahead, a weak ridge of <br />
high pressure will return with warming and drying conditions, but with lighter winds to keep conditions moderated. <br />
<br />
Closures/Restrictions: Some roads within the and near the fire perimeter remain closed and a temporary flight <br />
restriction (TFR) remains in effect around the fire area. Residents and visitors are also encouraged to maintain a <br />
safe distance from working aircraft conducting water filling operations on local water ways and lakes, including <br />
Loon and Long lakes.</span>

<br />
This is the final update from the Fox Complex.<br />
<br />
The Patton Meadow Fire of the Fox Complex remained at 8,930 acres yesterday with containment growing to <br />
90%.<br />
<br />
Tomorrow a local Type 4 team assumes management of the fire at 8:00am. Today they will shadow ODF Team 3 <br />
as they prepare to take over. When they assume management, they will complete any remaining mop up, patrol <br />
the perimeter of the fire, bring back any remaining, unnecessary equipment, and continue suppression repair <br />
work.<br />
<br />
Crews will continue mop up operations on the north side of the fire, going 200-300 feet deep, extinguishing any <br />
hot spots they discover. In the morning briefing, Operations Section Chief Rob Pentzer told crews, “Do one more <br />
grid, one more look for hot spots so we can have this wrapped up.” By the end of the shift, the entire fire <br />
perimeter will have a rind at least 200 feet deep into the interior.<br />
<br />
Efforts on the east, south and west sides of the fire will continue with hauling equipment back to fire camp and <br />
repairing dozer and hand lines that were part of the firefighting effort. As the firefighting effort winds down, most <br />
crews will be demobilizing and heading home or onto other fire assignments. There will be some crews and <br />
equipment remaining to help the Type 4 team manage the fire going forward.<br />
<br />
As the work continues, and the season continues, the public may see smoke from the interior of the fire. This is <br />
normal and does not pose any threat to the public.<br />
<br />
The Fremont-Winema Forest, and fire area, remains closed due to fire danger. For the latest information on the <br />
forest closures, go to https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/fremont-winema/alerts-notices/?cid=stelprdb5317501</span>

Northwest Incident Management Team 8 assumed management of the Green Ridge and Lick Creek Fires <br />
<br />
    yesterday morning.  The incident command post remains at the Last Resort near Pomeroy, WA.  <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Green Ridge Fire Statistics: Size: 39,546, Containment: 35%, Total Personnel: 220, Location: 30 miles east of <br />
Walla Walla, Reported: July 7, 2021, Cause: Lighting. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Lick Creek Fire Statistics: Size: 80,421, Containment: 100%, Total Personnel: 6, Location: 20 miles southwest of <br />
Asotin, WA, Reported: July 7, 2021, Cause: Lightning. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Current Situation: Green Ridge Fire: Activity on the Green Ridge Fire was minimal. No infra-red flight was flown <br />
due to cloud cover, therefore the acreages remain the same.  A Wildland Fire Module began scouting the <br />
southeastern corner of the fire, near Jefferson Springs, for options to construct direct containment line and a <br />
twenty-person crew from the Umatilla National Forest has arrived to support operations. Crews will continue to <br />
patrol and mop up sections of uncontrolled line along portions of the northeast, near Clear Water lookout tower <br />
and guard station, and southwest corner near Godman Trailhead along Skyline Drive. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Current Situation: Lick Creek Fire: The Lick Creek Fire remains 80,421 acres and is now 100% contained. <br />
Smoke will continue to be visible as unburned pockets of vegetation inside the fire perimeter are consumed. <br />
Crews will continue to mop-up any interior pockets of heat and patrol lines as they can safely.  <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Weather & Smoke Information: Today’s weather will start out partly cloudy, becoming mostly sunny with haze. <br />
Temperatures will have highs between 59-64 degrees along the ridges and 69-74 degrees in the valley bottoms. <br />
Winds will be from the east-northeast to 6 – 10 mph with gusts up to 18 mph in the afternoon. Relative humidity <br />
will range from 45-50% above 5000 feet and 35-40% in the valleys. Smoke information is available on <br />
Washington Smoke Blog at: https://wasmoke.blogspot.com/  <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Forest Closures: Closures are in place on the Umatilla National Forest. The forest closure includes all lands on <br />
the Pomeroy and Walla Walla Ranger Districts in Washington State.  The closure order is available at <br />
https://go.usa.gov/xFyhn. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Evacuations: Garfield and Columbia County currently have Level 1 and Level 2 evacuations in place. For more <br />
information on evacuations, please visit https://go.usa.gov/xFQJ2 for full information.   <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Temporary Flight Restrictions:For the safety of the firefighters and aircraft fighting the Green Ridge and Lick <br />
Creek Fires, a Temporary Flight Restriction is in place over the fire areas. Please consult the “Notice to Airman” <br />
for specifics. Wildfires are a “No Drone Zone.”  Whenever a drone is spotted near the fire all aircraft are <br />
grounded until we can be sure the drone is clear of the area. For more information, visit <br />

<br />
Overall Objective:  The Rough Patch Complex and Jack Fire are being managed under a full suppression <br />
strategy using containment and confinement tactics to minimize fire spread to prevent loss of valuable resource.  <br />
Leaders’ intent is to not allow the fire to progress to the west by using the PACE model – Primary, Alternate, <br />
Contingency and Emergency control Lines and to keep the fires as small as possible while working toward full <br />
containment.<br />
<br />
Chaos and Little Bend Fires:  The Chaos fire is at 13,529 acres and the Little Bend Fire is at 6,208 acres.  <br />
Securing the west side of the Chaos is progressing well – burnout operations are complete on this flank and <br />
firefighters are focused on holding the fire in place to prevent spread to the west.  The primary containment lines <br />
of these fires lay on the west and northwest flanks.  Crews worked to the north from Canton Point through Shane <br />
Saddle to burnout the containment line to prevent the fire from moving to the west-northwest.  Fire line <br />
construction from Shane Saddle to Bohemia Mountain will continue today to secure the Chaos fire from moving <br />
to the northwest.  Additional work is being done on the southeast side of the Chaos fire to prevent the fire from <br />
moving south, then to the west.  On the Little Bend Fire the west mid-section of the fire is contained and holding <br />
well.  Primary containment lines are complete between the Chaos and the Little Bend Fire and being reinforced <br />
with burning out of the fuels between the fires.  Alternate containment lines are being improved along the south <br />
flank of the fire as well.<br />
<br />
Jack and Buckhead Fires:  The Jack Fire is at 23,853 acres and the Buckhead fire is at 3,003 acres.  The Jack <br />
Fire has containment lines that are holding on the west, north, and northeast flanks of the fires - these lines <br />
account for a large amount of containment of the fire.  The Buckhead fire has burned into the Jack fire to the <br />
north - fire crews are patrolling these flanks and taking action to hold the lines as necessary.  The southwest and <br />
south flanks of the fire are seeing moderate fire behavior – tactics on these flanks include direct dozer line, the <br />
construction of primary and alternate contingency lines using the road system, building, and reinforcing <br />
contingency lines and conducting burnout operations as opportunities arise.<br />
<br />
Near Minky Fire:  The Near Minky Fire is at 4,387 acres.  This fire lays south of the Jack and Buckhead Fires.  <br />
The east flank of the fire and a portion of the west flank of the fire has been contained. The nearby Smith Fire <br />
that is part of the Devil’s Knob Complex is actively growing to the northeast in the Ash Valley area.  Because of <br />
this, additional firefighting resources have been moved to the area to assist in containing the Smith Fire while <br />
looking for opportunities to construct containment lines for both the Smith and Near Minky Fires.<br />
<br />
Closures:  Copies of all closures and maps can be found at https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/closures/7758/.<br />
<br />
    UPDATE to BLM Roseburg District fire closure.  The Francis Creek Road area and Scaredman Campground <br />
are again under a closure order due to potential fire activity, and to keep the area clear for firefighting operations.<br />
    The Umpqua and Willamette National Forests have area closure orders to encompass the Rough Patch, Jack, <br />
Archie Creek, and Devil's Knob Fire Areas.  The closure includes Canton Creek Campground, Musick Guard <br />
Station, and Cover Campground. <br />
    Highway 138 between Roseburg and Diamond remains open.  Slow down and be alert. <br />
<br />
Weather:  Increased winds from the northwest will promote active fire behavior.  As smoke clears, fire activity is <br />
expected to increase. Wing gust up to 20 mph and relative humidity in the mid- 20s to the upper 30s will promote <br />
fire spread.</span>

Northwest Incident Management Team 8 assumed management of the Green Ridge and Lick Creek Fires <br />
<br />
    yesterday morning.  The incident command post remains at the Last Resort near Pomeroy, WA.  <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Green Ridge Fire Statistics: Size: 39,546, Containment: 35%, Total Personnel: 220, Location: 30 miles east of <br />
Walla Walla, Reported: July 7, 2021, Cause: Lighting. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Lick Creek Fire Statistics: Size: 80,421, Containment: 100%, Total Personnel: 6, Location: 20 miles southwest of <br />
Asotin, WA, Reported: July 7, 2021, Cause: Lightning. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Current Situation: Green Ridge Fire: Activity on the Green Ridge Fire was minimal. No infra-red flight was flown <br />
due to cloud cover, therefore the acreages remain the same.  A Wildland Fire Module began scouting the <br />
southeastern corner of the fire, near Jefferson Springs, for options to construct direct containment line and a <br />
twenty-person crew from the Umatilla National Forest has arrived to support operations. Crews will continue to <br />
patrol and mop up sections of uncontrolled line along portions of the northeast, near Clear Water lookout tower <br />
and guard station, and southwest corner near Godman Trailhead along Skyline Drive. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Current Situation: Lick Creek Fire: The Lick Creek Fire remains 80,421 acres and is now 100% contained. <br />
Smoke will continue to be visible as unburned pockets of vegetation inside the fire perimeter are consumed. <br />
Crews will continue to mop-up any interior pockets of heat and patrol lines as they can safely.  <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Weather & Smoke Information: Today’s weather will start out partly cloudy, becoming mostly sunny with haze. <br />
Temperatures will have highs between 59-64 degrees along the ridges and 69-74 degrees in the valley bottoms. <br />
Winds will be from the east-northeast to 6 – 10 mph with gusts up to 18 mph in the afternoon. Relative humidity <br />
will range from 45-50% above 5000 feet and 35-40% in the valleys. Smoke information is available on <br />
Washington Smoke Blog at: https://wasmoke.blogspot.com/  <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Forest Closures: Closures are in place on the Umatilla National Forest. The forest closure includes all lands on <br />
the Pomeroy and Walla Walla Ranger Districts in Washington State.  The closure order is available at <br />
https://go.usa.gov/xFyhn. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Evacuations: Garfield and Columbia County currently have Level 1 and Level 2 evacuations in place. For more <br />
information on evacuations, please visit https://go.usa.gov/xFQJ2 for full information.   <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Temporary Flight Restrictions:For the safety of the firefighters and aircraft fighting the Green Ridge and Lick <br />
Creek Fires, a Temporary Flight Restriction is in place over the fire areas. Please consult the “Notice to Airman” <br />
for specifics. Wildfires are a “No Drone Zone.”  Whenever a drone is spotted near the fire all aircraft are <br />
grounded until we can be sure the drone is clear of the area. For more information, visit <br />

 <br />
Yesterday on the Bulldog Mountain fire, chipping of fuels along the northeast edge continued. Firefighters <br />
patrolled and took actions to hold the remainder of the fire within containment lines. <br />
<br />
Work will continue today to chip woody material and remove dangerous snags along the South Boulder Road. <br />
Firefighters expect to complete chipping along the 800 Road on the east side of the Mack fire in the next two <br />
days. This work will prepare the road as a fire line in the event that the fire moves out of its current footprint. <br />
<br />
Cloudy weather helped to moderate fire behavior yesterday. Today, slightly cooler and windier weather is <br />
expected as a cold front passed over the area last night. Even with these conditions, smoke may be visible as <br />
the fire continues to back down to the South Boulder Creek road.  <br />
<br />
Citizens should remain vigilant and are strongly encouraged to sign up for alerts at  Ferry County Alerts.  <br />
Motorists traveling on Boulder Hwy and SR395 should watch for heavy equipment and firefighters turning off and <br />
onto the roadway. Firefighter and public safety is our number one priority.  <br />
<br />
Smoke: Current weather conditions will moderate smoke impacts throughout the area today.  <br />
<br />
Closures: An area closure is in effect on Colville National Forest lands in the vicinity of the Bulldog Mountain Fire. <br />
For more information on area and road closures on the Colville National Forest, please visit: <br />
https://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fseprd938379.pdf <br />
<br />
Citizens are asked to stay clear of the fire area and comply with area closures.  <br />
<br />
While current weather conditions provide respite from the extreme fire potential present in northeast Washington, <br />
the forest can quickly dry out again in the many weeks of fire season ahead. Please continue to do all you can to <br />
prevent wildfires. <br />
<br />
The Incident Command Post is located in Inchelium, WA. A spike camp will remain in place in Kettle Falls, WA to <br />
support the Bulldog Mountain and Mack Mountain Fires.</span>

<br />
Aviation resources spotted a new start Thursday afternoon and were able to provide initial attack assistance to <br />
Oregon Department of Forestry. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
 The West Fir ODF Fire is located on the hillside between McLane Creek in Westfir and the water tower off West <br />
Second.  <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
An interagency Honor Guard escorted the body of fallen firefighter Frumencio Ruiz Carapia from Springfield to <br />
his hometown of Medford. A memorial is being planned and details will be provided at a later date. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Mop up continues on the Kwis Fire. Other equipment, personnel, and materials are being reassigned to the <br />
Gales Fire, where strategic ignitions and line prep continue. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
North winds may keep smoke in the valley longer today than previous days. Tonight, light northeast winds will <br />
bring in drier air that will continue through Sunday. Forecasted low humidity and high temperatures constitute <br />
near-critical fire weather, due to the lack of strong winds. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Safety: Logs from trees cut near roads and control lines are beginning to be hauled out of the fire zone to remove <br />
fuels from nearby control lines. In addition to fire engines and heavy equipment, be aware that log trucks and <br />
large machinery may be coming in and out of closure areas. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Hunting: Archery deer and elk season begin Saturday, Aug. 28. Access to federally-managed public lands is not <br />
managed by the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife. A large part of McKenzie Unit 19 lies within fire closure <br />
areas and will not be open to hunters. Full text of closure orders and maps on the Willamette National Forest, <br />
can be found at https://go.usa.gov/xFEP2. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Evacuations: Level 1 and Level 3 evacuation orders remain in place. For current evacuation information and an <br />
interactive map of evacuation areas, visit: www.lanecounty.org.</span>

<br />
Fire crews successfully conducted a slow and steady burn operation through vegetation Thursday to secure <br />
more of the northwest perimeter of the Muckamuck Fire, the most active of the four fires being managed by <br />
Northwest Interagency Incident Management Team 9. Another small burnout is planned today to secure the 25 <br />
road to the 38 road utilizing handline and hose lay as conditions permit. Firefighters will mop up and secure <br />
control lines within the town of Conconully and along West Lake Road, secure heat in around the 38 road <br />
corridor and coordinate hazard tree removal and other mitigation work with land owners.<br />
<br />
A Level 3 evacuation remains in effect for the Salmon Meadows-Kerr area. The Sinlahekin Road, North Fork <br />
Salmon Creek Road, Mineral Hill Road and the West Fork Road all remain closed outside of Conconully city <br />
limits.<br />

<br />
Overall Objective:  The Rough Patch Complex and Jack Fire are being managed under a full suppression <br />
strategy using containment and confinement tactics to minimize fire spread to prevent loss of valuable resource.  <br />
Leaders’ intent is to not allow the fire to progress to the west by using the PACE model – Primary, Alternate, <br />
Contingency and Emergency control Lines and to keep the fires as small as possible while working toward full <br />
containment.<br />
<br />
Chaos and Little Bend Fires:  The Chaos fire is at 13,529 acres and the Little Bend Fire is at 6,208 acres.  <br />
Securing the west side of the Chaos is progressing well – burnout operations are complete on this flank and <br />
firefighters are focused on holding the fire in place to prevent spread to the west.  The primary containment lines <br />
of these fires lay on the west and northwest flanks.  Crews worked to the north from Canton Point through Shane <br />
Saddle to burnout the containment line to prevent the fire from moving to the west-northwest.  Fire line <br />
construction from Shane Saddle to Bohemia Mountain will continue today to secure the Chaos fire from moving <br />
to the northwest.  Additional work is being done on the southeast side of the Chaos fire to prevent the fire from <br />
moving south, then to the west.  On the Little Bend Fire the west mid-section of the fire is contained and holding <br />
well.  Primary containment lines are complete between the Chaos and the Little Bend Fire and being reinforced <br />
with burning out of the fuels between the fires.  Alternate containment lines are being improved along the south <br />
flank of the fire as well.<br />
<br />
Jack and Buckhead Fires:  The Jack Fire is at 23,853 acres and the Buckhead fire is at 3,003 acres.  The Jack <br />
Fire has containment lines that are holding on the west, north, and northeast flanks of the fires - these lines <br />
account for a large amount of containment of the fire.  The Buckhead fire has burned into the Jack fire to the <br />
north - fire crews are patrolling these flanks and taking action to hold the lines as necessary.  The southwest and <br />
south flanks of the fire are seeing moderate fire behavior – tactics on these flanks include direct dozer line, the <br />
construction of primary and alternate contingency lines using the road system, building, and reinforcing <br />
contingency lines and conducting burnout operations as opportunities arise.<br />
<br />
Near Minky Fire:  The Near Minky Fire is at 4,387 acres.  This fire lays south of the Jack and Buckhead Fires.  <br />
The east flank of the fire and a portion of the west flank of the fire has been contained. The nearby Smith Fire <br />
that is part of the Devil’s Knob Complex is actively growing to the northeast in the Ash Valley area.  Because of <br />
this, additional firefighting resources have been moved to the area to assist in containing the Smith Fire while <br />
looking for opportunities to construct containment lines for both the Smith and Near Minky Fires.<br />
<br />
Closures:  Copies of all closures and maps can be found at https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/closures/7758/.<br />
<br />
    UPDATE to BLM Roseburg District fire closure.  The Francis Creek Road area and Scaredman Campground <br />
are again under a closure order due to potential fire activity, and to keep the area clear for firefighting operations.<br />
    The Umpqua and Willamette National Forests have area closure orders to encompass the Rough Patch, Jack, <br />
Archie Creek, and Devil's Knob Fire Areas.  The closure includes Canton Creek Campground, Musick Guard <br />
Station, and Cover Campground. <br />
    Highway 138 between Roseburg and Diamond remains open.  Slow down and be alert. <br />
<br />
Weather:  Increased winds from the northwest will promote active fire behavior.  As smoke clears, fire activity is <br />
expected to increase. Wing gust up to 20 mph and relative humidity in the mid- 20s to the upper 30s will promote <br />
fire spread.</span>

<br />
Yesterday: Forecasted northwest winds gusting to 20 mph delayed firing operations southeast of the fire area on <br />
Bethel Ridge on Washington Department of Natural Resources managed lands for most of the day. Winds <br />
moderated in the afternoon and crews were able to resume the firing operation and continued lighting through <br />
the evening hours. There was some increased fire behavior on the the northern portion of the fire, but crews and <br />
helicopters performing bucket drops were able to keep the fire in check without any issues. In the area of Cliffdell <br />
on the east flank of the fire, the fire became visible from Highway 410, with flames backing and material rolling <br />
down the steep slopes near the highway corridor.<br />
 <br />
Today: Gusty winds are predicted over the fire area again, which could delay the firing operation on the <br />
southeast portion of the fire. Fire managers want to ensure that this operation is completed in precise wind and <br />
weather conditions in order to be successful and will work with the Incident Meteorologist and Fire Behavior <br />
Analyst to ensure it is done in optimal conditions. Construction of indirect fire line continues west on Bethel Ridge <br />
to the William O. Douglas Wilderness boundary on the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest today. Dozers are <br />
connecting natural features on their way to Forest Road (FR) 199 and down FR 1500 to Wildcat Road area to <br />
contain the southern perimeter of the fire. Structure protection work continues north of the fire near the junction <br />
of Highway 410 and US 12 today. Crews will also be using heavy equipment where possible to improve indirect <br />
containment lines on Old River Road. Firefighters working the night shift will continue the important work of <br />
monitoring fire activity and structures in the Gold Creek and Bumping River areas on the north end of the fire and <br />
on the south, crews will be holding and securing the recently burned fire perimeter on Bethel Ridge.<br />
<br />
Evacuations: LEVEL 3: Bumping River Road from north to south; LEVEL 2: Hwy 410 from Bumping River Road <br />
to U.S. Route 12. LEVEL 1: From U.S. 12 at Hwy 410 west to Tieton Reservoir Road; Yakima County Office of <br />

Cloudy weather helped to moderate fire behavior yesterday, but pockets of unburned fuel exposed to wind and <br />
sun are becoming receptive to burning. Firefighters will use helicopters where necessary to drop water to slow <br />
the fire and keep it within containment lines. <br />
<br />
Yesterday firefighters successfully joined several sections of completed fire line and conducted small-scale <br />
burning operations to remove unburned fuels near fire lines on the northern and northeastern flanks. Firefighters <br />
continued to mop-up and patrol on the southeast, south and southwestern flanks, and to retrieve firefighting <br />
equipment from the Twin Lakes area. <br />
<br />
Crews will continue to work on direct and indirect fire line on the north flank of the fire. A national guard crew is <br />
working on gridding and mop up operations from the completed line that is on the northeast flank of the fire.  <br />
<br />
A cold front passed over the area last night that brough slightly cooler and windier weather. Firefighters will <br />
monitor weather and fuel conditions for opportunities to burn small areas to strengthen containment lines. Smoke <br />
may be visible from these operations. Work is underway to improve roads in the Lynx Mountain area to be used <br />
as containment lines. <br />
<br />
On all unlined portions of the fire, the strategy is to build fire line as close to the fire’s edge as possible, and to <br />
strengthen these lines with small-scale burning where it can be effective. <br />
<br />
The Colville Reservation reopened to industrial activities and the general public this morning at 12:01 a.m.  <br />
<br />
While current weather conditions provide respite from the extreme fire potential present in northeast Washington, <br />
the forest can quickly dry out again in the many weeks of fire season ahead. Please continue to do all you can to <br />
prevent wildfires. <br />
<br />
Smoke: Current weather conditions will moderate smoke impacts throughout the area today.  <br />

<br />
Yesterday an Unmanned Aerial System &#40;UAS&#41; detected several hot spots west of Fields Point Landing that were <br />
quickly extinguished by crews on the ground. A small slop over near Slide Peak was held in check by hand crews <br />
supported by scooper aircraft. Line construction and preparation for future firing operations continued along <br />
Devil’s Backbone and is expected to be completed by end of shift on Sunday. Containment line between <br />
Crescent Hill and Grouse Mountain are in place with only minor improvements needed. Improvement and <br />
securing of containment lines along the northern perimeter of the fire progressed well and is expected to be <br />
completed by end of shift today. Aircraft from the North Cascade Smoke Jumper Base re-supplied Spike Camps <br />
on Devil’s Backbone with two para-cargo drops.<br />
 <br />
Today, an emphasis on completing preparations for firing operations, should they be needed, will be the objective <br />
of crews along the southern and western perimeters today. Along the northern perimeter from Grouse Mountain <br />

<br />
he Walker Creek Fire is located approximately 13 miles east/northeast of Tonasket, Washington, surrounding <br />
Lake Bonaparte. The Incident Command Post is being established at the Omak Stampede Grounds and is <br />
closed to all but essential personnel to help ensure the health and safety of community members and firefighters. <br />
Both fires received limited precipitation last night, and temperatures will be 60 to 70 degrees today.<br />
<br />
Firefighters prepared indirect containment lines on the northern perimeter of the Walker Creek Fire yesterday <br />
and are using dozers and hand crews to build additional direct fire line to minimize acres burned and protect <br />
timber and natural resources. The fire is mostly in mop-up on the eastern perimeter, with crews using water to <br />
cool smoking peat bogs near the fire line. Firefighters are continuing to construct hose lays on the southern edge <br />
of the fire. Some resources will be leaving over the next few days to rest and refurbish equipment and will be <br />
reallocated to priority incidents across the region. Additional resources are on order to replace those that are <br />
timing out.</span>
