<br />
Crews will continue to mop-up and work on suppression repair in all divisions today. The fire remains at 85% <br />
containment and that number is expected to increase in the days ahead. The Type 2 Incident Command <br />
Team, Northwest 6 will be transitioning the fire to a local Type 3 Team tomorrow, August 25 at 7:00 am.<br />
<br />
Suppression efforts on the Black Butte fire were successful due to a lot of hard work from many partners and <br />
firefighters. The fire began after a lightning strike and quickly spread due to steep terrain, extremely dry fuels, <br />
and weather. Over time, the fire interacted with over 90 fuels treatments (prescribed burns, pile burns, slash <br />
clean up and thinning projects) slowing its forward progress. With the advantage of the pre-existing fuel <br />
treatments and moderate wind, firefighters were able to initiate offensive strategies to increase containment.<br />
<br />
Fire danger continues to be extreme on the Malheur National Forest and surrounding areas and fire <br />
restrictions are in place. Please remember to use caution while visiting public lands. Propane stoves and <br />
lanterns are permitted, but no open flames or campfires are allowed.<br />
<br />
Recreation Sites within the closure boundary: North Fork Malheur River Trailheads both north and south, <br />
North Fork Malheur Campground, Crane Crossing Trailheads both east and west, Short Creek Guard Station, <br />
Elk Creek Campground, Sunshine Flat Trailhead and Trail, Horseshoe Trailhead and Trail, Sheep Creek Trail <br />
and Trailhead, Little Crane Campground.<br />
<br />
Currently the Trout Farm and Crescent Campgrounds are still open to the public.<br />

<br />
Yesterday, the Bull Complex grew approximately 300 acres.  It is progressing in a slow and steady manner, <br />
which allows fire managers time to develop and implement plans for containment in areas where the <br />
probability of success is higher and it will be safer for firefighters to work along the fire perimeter.  <br />
<br />
On the southwestern portion of the fire perimeter, near the headwaters of Humbug Creek, firefighters continue <br />
to light small strategic fires parallel to the main fire to lower intensity and slow the fire’s progress towards <br />
desired containment lines along the ridge that divides the Mt. Hood and Willamette National Forests.  The fire <br />
is approaching these containment lines.  Once firefighters gain some containment here, they will be able to <br />
start working both east and west along constructed firelines.  On the northeastern corner, between Ogre and <br />
Dunno Creeks, firefighters are relying on previous fire areas (including the 2017 Jazz Fire) to slow fire growth.   <br />
<br />
The western edge of the fire is the most challenging for firefighters to safely take action.  Fire managers <br />
continue to assess roads, natural features, and additional recently burned areas (including the 2020 Beachie <br />
Fire) outside the wilderness that are suitable for containment lines and to improve them by removing <br />
vegetation.  These plans are being coordinated with both National Forests and Oregon Department of <br />
Forestry, along with other local officials.   <br />
<br />
Morning smoke inversions limited the use of aviation resources until the early afternoon.  Although west winds <br />
picked up in the afternoon, they also brought increased relative humidity and lowered temperatures. Today is <br />
expected to be even cooler with relative humidity increasing further.  There is little to no chance for <br />
precipitation over the fire area.  This trend will continue tomorrow.  Then Saturday and Sunday are expected <br />
to warm again. <br />
<br />
Closures:  For the safety of wildland firefighters and the public, the National Forests have enacted area <br />
closures that prevent the public from being upon National Forest System lands in the vicinity of the Bull <br />
Complex where uncontrolled fire and fire suppression activities are occurring. All National Forest System <br />
lands that are south and west of Forest Road 46, and east of the Riverside Fire perimeter. The entire length of <br />
National Forest Road 46 is closed. The lands within the 2020 Lionshead and Beachie Fire areas are also <br />
closed.  See the closure orders and maps at https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/closures/7773/. <br />
<br />
Contractors approved by the Forest Service through a permit system are allowed through the closure order, <br />
as are vendors and others working on recovery efforts related to the 2020 area fires.  Breitenbush Hot <br />
Springs Resort is open; however, reservations are required to pass through a roadblock on NFR 46. <br />

Kettle Falls, WA –Taking advantage of another day of reduced fire behavior, firefighters continued holding the <br />
Bulldog Mountain and Mack Mountain fires within their current perimeters yesterday. Slightly higher <br />
temperatures and lower humidity was enough to dry out fuels in areas exposed to sun, causing them to burn <br />
at low intensity and put up some smoke.<br />
<br />
On both fires, the construction of direct containment line along the fire’s edge is not possible due to the steep <br />
and inaccessible terrain. Firefighters are completing and reinforcing indirect containment lines where terrain <br />
and access permit, usually at some distance from the fire’s edge. These lines utilize existing roads and some <br />
newly constructed hand and dozer line, which will surround both fires when completed.<br />
<br />
Work is nearly complete to the south of Mack Mountain Fire to connect the last link of a contingency line from <br />
Albion Hill to Deadman Creek. Mastication of large woody materials along the 320 Road northeast of the fire <br />
is also nearly complete.<br />
<br />
Warmer temperatures and slightly increased winds are predicted for the next several days. There is a 50% <br />
chance of rain by Thursday night into Friday morning, with rainfall amounts predicted to range from .10 to .20 <br />
inches.<br />
<br />
Citizens should remain vigilant and are strongly encouraged to sign up for alerts at  Ferry County Alerts.  <br />
Motorists traveling on Boulder Hwy and SR395 should watch for heavy equipment and firefighters turning off <br />
and onto the roadway. Firefighter and public safety is our number one priority. <br />
<br />
Smoke: Current weather conditions will moderate smoke impacts throughout the area today.<br />
<br />
Closures: An area closure is in effect on Colville National Forest lands in the vicinity of the Bulldog Mountain <br />
Fire. For more information on area and road closures on the Colville National Forest, please visit: <br />
https://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fseprd938379.pdf<br />
<br />
Citizens are asked to stay clear of the fire area and comply with area closures. <br />
<br />
While current weather conditions provide respite from the extreme fire potential present in northeast <br />
Washington, the forest can quickly dry out again in the many weeks of fire season ahead. Please continue to <br />
do all you can to prevent wildfires.<br />
<br />
The Incident Command Post has been relocated to Inchelium as Team 7 also assumes command of the <br />
Summit Trail Fire. A spike camp will remain in place to support the Bulldog Mountain and Mack Mountain <br />
Fires.</span>

Cedar Creek Fire: The fire is 55,187 acres and 80% contained. The entire fire area will be on patrol status. <br />
Mop up will occur in areas burning near the edge of the fire to further secure the containment line. Abernathy <br />
Ridge on the southwest part of the fire is being monitored from the air due to steep, inaccessible terrain. <br />
Helicopter water drops will be used as needed to cool areas near the fire’s edge to assist ground crews <br />
securing containment lines. A couple of areas of smoke were reported by the public yesterday. These were <br />
checked by aerial surveillance and found to be fuels burning well within the interior of the fire.<br />
<br />
Cub Creek 2 Fire: The Cub Creek 2 Fire is 70,186 acres and 70% contained. Crews will continue removing <br />
hose, pumps, and other equipment from the fire area for repair and reconditioning for use on future fires. <br />
Crews are patrolling and mopping up hot areas to secure the fire’s edge, including chipping of large, <br />
unburned vegetation. Crews continue to patrol near cabins. Opportunities to mitigate damage caused by <br />
suppression, such as dozer and hand lines, are being identified and prioritized for repair.<br />
<br />
Delancy Fire: The Delancy Fire is being monitored by aerial surveillance and remains at 223 acres and 95% <br />
containment.<br />
<br />
Fire Weather: Cooler temperatures and higher humidity Thursday will accompany an approaching cold front <br />
with south-westerly flow and cooler temperatures. There will be areas of gusty, westerly winds to 20 mph <br />
down the upper Methow Valley during the day, moving down the valley later in the afternoon. Winds in the <br />
higher terrain will be westerly at around 10 mph.<br />
<br />
The following trails are currently closed: Cedar Creek Trail, Driveway Butte Trail, Lone Fire Trail, Cutthroat <br />
NRT Trail, and Wolf Creek Trail. The Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest has implemented a Fire <br />
Emergency Area Closure as of July 22, 2021. The Closure includes facilities, roads, and trails. The Closure <br />
may be viewed in its entirety at the “Cedar Creek and Delancy Fires 2021” Facebook page or <br />
https://www.fs.usda.gov/okawen. Fire Restrictions: Campfire restrictions are in effect. Campfires are <br />
prohibited throughout the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest, including developed campgrounds and <br />
congressionally designated Wilderness. Call local ranger district offices for more information. Fire Restrictions <br />
Information: https://www.fs.usda.gov/alerts/okawen/alerts-notices.<br />
<br />
Driving in the area: Communities in the fire area are currently open. Visitors and local residents are <br />
encouraged to exercise caution when driving in the area. Smoke will reduce visibility and increase the <br />
potential for accidents. Use headlights when driving in smoke and please stay focused on the road. Drivers <br />
are urged to exercise caution with school now in session. Displaced wildlife is moving around lower elevations <br />
as well.</span>

Current Situation:<br />
<br />
The Chickadee Creek Fire is located approximately 15 miles west of<br />
Tonasket, Washington. The Walker Creek Fire is located approximately 13<br />
miles east/northeast of Tonasket, Washington, surrounding Lake<br />
Bonaparte. Northwest Incident Management Team 12 took over<br />
management of both fires this morning from the Rocky Mountain Blue<br />
Team.<br />
Operations<br />
Conditions were drier on both fires yesterday, although fire behavior did<br />
not increase due to relatively calm winds. Firefighters worked on<br />
constructing a hose lay around the northwest corner of the Chickadee<br />
Creek Fire yesterday. Fire crews performed a burnout on a portion of the<br />
northern perimeter of the Chickadee Creek Fire last night, and firefighters<br />
will work to secure containment lines in that area today.<br />
Walker Creek Fire operations yesterday focused on improving<br />
containment lines around the fire. In the southwestern portion of the fire,<br />
burnout operations supported hand crews working to build fire<br />
containment lines. Heavy helicopters dropped water buckets in the<br />
southwestern portion of the fire to support fire crews on the ground.<br />
Firefighters continued to work protecting structures and mopping up south<br />
of the Bonaparte Lake area. Operations will continue today on both fires,<br />
constructing direct and indirect fire control lines and cooling hot spots with<br />
water bucket drops from helicopters.</span>

Cedar Creek Fire: The fire is 55,187 acres and 80% contained. The entire fire area will be on patrol status. <br />
Mop up will occur in areas burning near the edge of the fire to further secure the containment line. Abernathy <br />
Ridge on the southwest part of the fire is being monitored from the air due to steep, inaccessible terrain. <br />
Helicopter water drops will be used as needed to cool areas near the fire’s edge to assist ground crews <br />
securing containment lines. A couple of areas of smoke were reported by the public yesterday. These were <br />
checked by aerial surveillance and found to be fuels burning well within the interior of the fire.<br />
<br />
Cub Creek 2 Fire: The Cub Creek 2 Fire is 70,186 acres and 70% contained. Crews will continue removing <br />
hose, pumps, and other equipment from the fire area for repair and reconditioning for use on future fires. <br />
Crews are patrolling and mopping up hot areas to secure the fire’s edge, including chipping of large, <br />
unburned vegetation. Crews continue to patrol near cabins. Opportunities to mitigate damage caused by <br />
suppression, such as dozer and hand lines, are being identified and prioritized for repair.<br />
<br />
Delancy Fire: The Delancy Fire is being monitored by arial surveillance and remains at 223 acres and 95% <br />
containment.<br />
<br />
Fire Weather: Cooler temperatures and higher humidity Thursday will accompany an approaching cold front <br />
with south-westerly flow and cooler temperatures. There will be areas of gusty, westerly winds to 20 mph <br />
down the upper Methow Valley during the day, moving down the valley later in the afternoon. Winds in the <br />
higher terrain will be westerly at around 10 mph.</span>

from Douglas and Linn counties through the Office of Oregon State Fire Marshall as well as resources from <br />
Douglas Forest Protective Association are in place and working to protect structures in that area. <br />
<br />
Along the fire’s northwest edge, firefighters are taking advantage of moderated fire behavior and using dozers to <br />
build indirect line to prepare for future strategic firing. Crews continue to mop up previous firing operations and <br />
prep roads for future use as firelines throughout the perimeter. <br />
<br />
Big Hamlin Fire (12,801 acres): The fire’s growth has moderated as firefighters work to further build firelines and <br />
implement other control strategies. Containment lines along the west side are holding well. Crews continue to <br />
mop up from previous firing operations around the western edge and are working to identify and construct <br />
indirect holding features along the eastern flank in preparation for future firing operations. Along the southern <br />
perimeter, firefighters continue with strategic firing operations as weather allows. <br />
<br />
Current Situation on Dismal Creek, Little Applegate,Mule Creek, Section 30 (Railroad) and Wild Cat fires (1,489 <br />
total acres): These fires are contained and remain in patrol status. <br />
<br />
Weather: The area forecast calls for mostly sunny skies with temperatures in the mid-70s to mid-80s into the <br />
weekend. Continued dry conditions and low humidity will likely contribute to increased fire activity.  Winds should <br />
be light with a prevailing northwestern flow through today, but might realign to a northeasterly flow Friday, <br />
encouraging fire activity in canyons and drainages that have been relatively quiet to date.  <br />
<br />
Air Quality: Overlying smoky conditions should prevail and moderate the fire’s spread. However, smoke levels <br />
can change rapidly depending on weather. Check current conditions on the Oregon Smoke Information Blog at <br />
http://oregonsmoke.blogspot.com. <br />
<br />
Aviation Operations: The Incident Management Team is establishing a helibase near Days Creek to better <br />
support firefighting efforts. For the safety of firefighters and aircraft fighting the Devil’s Knob Complex,  a <br />
temporary flight restriction remains over portions of the fire area. Wildfires are also a “No Drone Zone.” <br />

Announcement: Evacuation zones have been further reduced. Please refer to the map on Inciweb at <br />
https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/7803/ or Stevens County Sheriffs Office Facebook Page. Again, evacuations <br />
zones have been reduced. Please check the map for your specific address, if you have questions you can call <br />
the fire information phone lines above. <br />
<br />
Overview: The Ford Corkscrew Fire showed Moderate fire behavior yesterday along the north flank and within <br />
the interior, which continues to exhibit torching and spotting while consuming unburned pockets of fuel. Crews <br />
will continue conducting infrared structure assessments and developing reports for properties impacted by the <br />
Ford Corkscrew Fire. Red and white striped flagging mays still be visible in driveways to indicate a completed <br />
infrared assessment for that property. Evacuations are still in place. Residents should monitor <br />
https://www.facebook.com/stevenscountyem for the latest information and are encouraged to stay out of <br />
evacuated areas for their own safety and the safety of the firefighters. <br />
<br />
Fire Update: During yesterday’s operational period, resources continued to construct direct and indirect <br />
containment line and conduct point protection near values at risk. Firing operations occurred in some areas to <br />
remove unburned fuel between the fire edge and secure control lines. Crews also continued mop up activities, <br />
patrolled containment lines, worked to secure interior unburned islands, and identified suppression repair <br />
needs.  <br />
<br />
Crews will continue to scout and construct direct fire line on the north edge of the fire where safe to do so. <br />
Resources in all divisions will monitor and mop up within completed lines, provide point protection where <br />
needed and continue to identify suppression repair needs. Crews will also secure unburned islands around <br />
structures, including in Rail Canyon. Assessment of damaged and destroyed structures is completed. <br />
<br />
Weather: For Thursday and Friday, an approaching upper level trough and weak cold front will bring <br />
increasing moisture and weak instability. The result will be more mid and high clouds Thursday with more <br />
lower-level clouds on Friday. Temperature and relative humidity trends will reverse with slight cooler <br />
temperatures and slightly raised humidity. Thursday will bring moderately breezy southwest winds ahead of <br />
the system. Thursday night, through Friday will provide a chance of showers and possibly an isolated <br />
thunderstorm over the fire, but with mostly light amounts expected, the chances for a wetting rain looks low. <br />
<br />
Closures/Restrictions: Road closures remain in place and a reduced, temporary flight restriction (TFR) <br />
remains in effect around the fire area. Residents and visitors are also encouraged to maintain a safe distance <br />
from working aircraft conducting water filling operations on local water ways and lakes, including Loon and <br />
Long lakes.  <br />
<br />
If you fly, we can’t: Flying recreational drones over or near wildfires could cause injury or death to firefighters <br />
and hamper the effectiveness of wildfire suppression operations. If recreational drones are detected over or <br />
near a wildfire, aerial firefighting aircraft may be grounded, causing wildfires to grow larger and unduly <br />
threaten lives, property, and natural and cultural resources. Individuals who interfere with wildfire suppression <br />
efforts may be subject to civil penalties.</span>

The Patton Meadow Fire of the Fox Complex remained at 8,930 acres yesterday with containment growing to <br />
80%.<br />
<br />
Today crews will continue mop up operations around the fire, building a rind of up to 300 feet in some areas. <br />
Work on the north end of the fire is where crews continue to find and extinguish the highest number of hot spots. <br />
Operation Section Chief Eric Perkins said in the morning briefing to be diligent in mopping up and to “keep <br />
looking for hot spots you didn’t see yesterday, or the day before, to ensure we are being thorough.”<br />
<br />
As containment increases and is complete on the south, west and east sides of the fire, crews are working to <br />
remove hose lays and repair areas impacted by fire containment efforts. As the firefighting effort winds down, <br />
more crews will be demobilizing and heading home or onto other fire assignments.<br />
<br />
There is a Facebook Live community closeout meeting tonight at 7p.m. on the South Central Oregon Fire <br />
Management Partnership Facebook page. The link for the meeting is https://fb.me/e/1xp006hh5</span>

<br />
Current Situation: Green Ridge Fire: The Green Ridge Fire remains 35% contained and is 39,546 acres with a 56 <br />
acres growth in 24 hours. Fire activity was minimal again. Crews continued mopping up sections of uncontrolled <br />
line in divisions M and K. Crews completed the removal of equipment and miles of hose from contained portions <br />
of line on the north and west sides of the fire so this equipment can be cleaned and redistributed to other <br />
incidents across the west.  <br />
<br />
<br />
The drying trend that started earlier this week will continue today with increased wind and is expected to result in <br />
a slight increase in fire behavior and some smoke production.    <br />
<br />
Current Situation: Lick Creek Fire: The Lick Creek Fire remains 80,421 acres and 97% contained. Smoke will <br />
continue to be visible as unburned pockets of vegetation inside the fire perimeter are consumed. Crews will <br />
continue to mop-up any interior pockets of heat and patrol lines as they can safely do so.  <br />
<br />
Weather & Smoke Information: Today’s weather will be partly cloudy with smoke and haze. Temperatures will <br />
have highs between 61-66 degrees along the ridges and 70-75 degrees in the valley bottoms. Winds will be west <br />
to northwest at 6 – 10 mph with gusts to 20 mph. Relative humidity will range from 35-40%. Smoke information is <br />
available on Washington Smoke Blog at: https://wasmoke.blogspot.com/  <br />
<br />
Forest Closures: Closures are in place on the Umatilla National Forest. All of the Pomeroy Ranger District and <br />
portions of the Walla Walla Ranger District near the Green Ridge and Lick Creek fires are closed. The full closure <br />
order and map is available on Inciweb: https://go.usa.gov/xFXhP  <br />
<br />
Evacuations: Garfield County currently has Level 1 and Level 2 evacuations in place. Columbia County currently <br />
has Level 1 and Level 2 evacuations in place. For more information on evacuations, please visit <br />
https://go.usa.gov/xFQJ2 for full information.   <br />
<br />
Temporary Flight Restrictions: For the safety of the firefighters and aircraft fighting the Green Ridge and Lick <br />
Creek Fires, a Temporary Flight Restriction is in place over the fire areas. Please consult the “Notice to Airman” <br />
for specifics. Wildfires are a “No Drone Zone.”  Whenever a drone is spotted near the fire all aircraft are <br />
grounded until we can be sure the drone is clear of the area. For more information, visit <br />

Overall Objective:  The Rough Patch Complex and Jack Fire are being managed under a full suppression <br />
strategy using containment and confinement tactics to minimize fire spread to prevent loss of valuable <br />
resources.  Leaders’ intent is to not allow the fire to progress to the west and to protect private structures <br />
throughout the fire area by using the PACE model – Primary, Alternate, Contingency and Emergency control <br />
Lines and to keep the fires as small as possible while working toward full containment.<br />
<br />
Closures:  Copies of all closures and maps can be found at https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/closures/7758/.<br />
<br />
·         UPDATE to BLM Roseburg District fire closure.  The Francis Creek Road area and Scaredman <br />
Campground are again under a closure order due to potential fire activity, and to keep the area clear for <br />
firefighting operations.<br />
<br />
·         The Umpqua and Willamette National Forests have area closure orders to encompass the Rough <br />
Patch, Jack, Archie Creek, and Devil's Knob Fire Areas.  The closure includes Canton Creek Campground, <br />
Musick Guard Station, and Cover Campground. <br />
<br />
·         Highway 138 between Roseburg and Diamond Lake and Crater Lake remains open.  Slow down and <br />
be alert while passing through the fire area. <br />
<br />
Chaos and Little Bend Fires:  Securing the west side of the Chaos is progressing well – burnout operations <br />
are complete on this flank of the fire and firefighters are focused on holding the fire in place to prevent spread <br />
to the west.  The primary containment lines of these fires lay on the west and northwest flanks.  Crews are <br />
working to the north from Canton Point through Shane Saddle and onto Bohemia Mountain to construct fire <br />
line to secure the Chaos fire from moving to the northwest.  Additional work is being done on the southeast <br />
side of the Chaos fire to prevent the fire from moving south then to the west.  On the Little Bend Fire, the west <br />
mid-section of the fire is contained and holding well.  Containment lines are complete between the Chaos and <br />
the Little Bend Fire and being reinforced with burning out of the fuels between the fires.<br />
<br />
Jack and Buckhead Fires:  The Jack Fire has containment lines that are holding on the west, north, and east <br />
flanks of the fires and these lines account for a large amount of containment of the fire.  The Buckhead fire <br />
has burned into the Jack fire to the north - fire crews are patrolling these flanks and taking action to hold the <br />
lines as necessary.  The southwest and south flanks of the fire are seeing moderate fire behavior – tactics on <br />
these flanks include direct dozer line, the construction of primary and alternate contingency lines using the <br />
road system, building and reinforcing contingency lines and conducting burnout operations as opportunities <br />
arise. <br />
<br />
Near Minky Fire:  This fire lays south of the Jack and Buckhead Fires.  The east flank of the fire has been <br />
contained. The nearby Smith Fire that is part of the Devil’s Knob Complex is actively growing to the northeast <br />
into Ash Valley.  Because of this, additional firefighting resources have been moved into the area to assist in <br />
containing the Smith Fire while looking for opportunities to construct containment lines for both the Smith and <br />
Near Minky Fires.  The Near Minky Fire is at 0% containment.<br />
<br />
Weather:  Winds over all the fires are predominately out of the northwest.  As smoke clears, fire activity is <br />
expected to increase. Gust up to 18 mph can further promote fire spread.  Afternoon relative humidity is <br />
expected to be in the mid- 20s to the upper 30s which will also promote elevated burning conditions.</span>

<br />
Current Situation: Green Ridge Fire: The Green Ridge Fire remains 35% contained and is 39,546 acres with a 56 <br />
acres growth in 24 hours. Fire activity was minimal again. Crews continued mopping up sections of uncontrolled <br />
line in divisions M and K. Crews completed the removal of equipment and miles of hose from contained portions <br />
of line on the north and west sides of the fire so this equipment can be cleaned and redistributed to other <br />
incidents across the west.  <br />
<br />
<br />
The drying trend that started earlier this week will continue today with increased wind and is expected to result in <br />
a slight increase in fire behavior and some smoke production.    <br />
<br />
Current Situation: Lick Creek Fire: The Lick Creek Fire remains 80,421 acres and 97% contained. Smoke will <br />
continue to be visible as unburned pockets of vegetation inside the fire perimeter are consumed. Crews will <br />
continue to mop-up any interior pockets of heat and patrol lines as they can safely do so.  <br />
<br />
Weather & Smoke Information: Today’s weather will be partly cloudy with smoke and haze. Temperatures will <br />
have highs between 61-66 degrees along the ridges and 70-75 degrees in the valley bottoms. Winds will be west <br />
to northwest at 6 – 10 mph with gusts to 20 mph. Relative humidity will range from 35-40%. Smoke information is <br />
available on Washington Smoke Blog at: https://wasmoke.blogspot.com/  <br />
<br />
Forest Closures: Closures are in place on the Umatilla National Forest. All of the Pomeroy Ranger District and <br />
portions of the Walla Walla Ranger District near the Green Ridge and Lick Creek fires are closed. The full closure <br />
order and map is available on Inciweb: https://go.usa.gov/xFXhP  <br />
<br />
Evacuations: Garfield County currently has Level 1 and Level 2 evacuations in place. Columbia County currently <br />
has Level 1 and Level 2 evacuations in place. For more information on evacuations, please visit <br />
https://go.usa.gov/xFQJ2 for full information.   <br />
<br />
Temporary Flight Restrictions: For the safety of the firefighters and aircraft fighting the Green Ridge and Lick <br />
Creek Fires, a Temporary Flight Restriction is in place over the fire areas. Please consult the “Notice to Airman” <br />
for specifics. Wildfires are a “No Drone Zone.”  Whenever a drone is spotted near the fire all aircraft are <br />
grounded until we can be sure the drone is clear of the area. For more information, visit <br />

 <br />
Kettle Falls, WA –Taking advantage of another day of reduced fire behavior, firefighters continued holding the <br />
Bulldog Mountain and Mack Mountain fires within their current perimeters yesterday. Slightly higher <br />
temperatures and lower humidity was enough to dry out fuels in areas exposed to sun, causing them to burn <br />
at low intensity and put up some smoke.<br />
<br />
On both fires, the construction of direct containment line along the fire’s edge is not possible due to the steep <br />
and inaccessible terrain. Firefighters are completing and reinforcing indirect containment lines where terrain <br />
and access permit, usually at some distance from the fire’s edge. These lines utilize existing roads and some <br />
newly constructed hand and dozer line, which will surround both fires when completed.<br />
<br />
Work is nearly complete to the south of Mack Mountain Fire to connect the last link of a contingency line from <br />
Albion Hill to Deadman Creek. Mastication of large woody materials along the 320 Road northeast of the fire <br />
is also nearly complete.<br />
<br />
Warmer temperatures and slightly increased winds are predicted for the next several days. There is a 50% <br />
chance of rain by Thursday night into Friday morning, with rainfall amounts predicted to range from .10 to .20 <br />
inches.<br />
<br />
Citizens should remain vigilant and are strongly encouraged to sign up for alerts at  Ferry County Alerts.  <br />
Motorists traveling on Boulder Hwy and SR395 should watch for heavy equipment and firefighters turning off <br />
and onto the roadway. Firefighter and public safety is our number one priority. <br />
<br />
Smoke: Current weather conditions will moderate smoke impacts throughout the area today.<br />
<br />
Closures: An area closure is in effect on Colville National Forest lands in the vicinity of the Bulldog Mountain <br />
Fire. For more information on area and road closures on the Colville National Forest, please visit: <br />
https://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fseprd938379.pdf<br />
<br />
Citizens are asked to stay clear of the fire area and comply with area closures. <br />
<br />
While current weather conditions provide respite from the extreme fire potential present in northeast <br />
Washington, the forest can quickly dry out again in the many weeks of fire season ahead. Please continue to <br />
do all you can to prevent wildfires.<br />
<br />
The Incident Command Post has been relocated to Inchelium as Team 7 also assumes command of the <br />
Summit Trail Fire. A spike camp will remain in place to support the Bulldog Mountain and Mack Mountain <br />
Fires.</span>

WESTFIR, Ore. – As alternate and contingency lines are completed, firefighters are using ground and aerial <br />
means of ignition to strengthen and reinforce them around the Gales Fire footprint.   <br />
<br />
Specially-equipped Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) -- or drones – can be used to strategically ignite <br />
vegetation, collect infrared images that show the location and intensity of fire activity, and for real-time <br />
reconnaissance of terrain too rough or otherwise dangerous for firefighters on foot. <br />
<br />
UAS pilots are highly trained and work as part of the overall aviation operations on an incident, just like <br />
helicopters and air tankers. Unauthorized use of a UAS interferes with aerial operations causing manned and <br />
unmanned aircraft to be grounded. Remember -- if you fly, we can’t! <br />
<br />
On the Kwis Fire, crews will mop up the fire line to a 100-foot depth around the fire boundary to ensure <br />
containment before the incident is returned to the Willamette National Forest’s management. <br />
<br />
Evacuations: Lane County Sheriff’s Office has announced evacuation levels will remain unchanged for the <br />
foreseeable future. A Level 1 – Be Ready – evacuation notice is in place for Oakridge and Westfir. A Level 3 – <br />
Go Now! – is in place for Puma and Bedrock campgrounds. For current evacuation information and an <br />
interactive map of evacuation areas, visit: www.lanecounty.org.   <br />
<br />
Hunting: Archery deer and elk season begin Saturday, Aug. 28. Access to federally-managed public lands is <br />
not managed by the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife. A large part of McKenzie Unit 19 lies within fire <br />
closure areas and will not be open to hunters. Full text of closure orders and maps on the Willamette National <br />
Forest, can be found at https://go.usa.gov/xFEP2. <br />
<br />
There are numerous other public land closures across the Cascades region and the Pacific Northwest. An <br />
interactive map showing all public land closures can be found at tinyurl.com/4j3fxy8y. Private land <br />
accessibility can be found at this website: http://www.ofic.com/private-forestland-closures/</span>

Overall Objective:  The Rough Patch Complex and Jack Fire are being managed under a full suppression <br />
strategy using containment and confinement tactics to minimize fire spread to prevent loss of valuable <br />
resources.  Leaders’ intent is to not allow the fire to progress to the west and to protect private structures <br />
throughout the fire area by using the PACE model – Primary, Alternate, Contingency and Emergency control <br />
Lines and to keep the fires as small as possible while working toward full containment.<br />
<br />
Closures:  Copies of all closures and maps can be found at https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/closures/7758/.<br />
<br />
·         UPDATE to BLM Roseburg District fire closure.  The Francis Creek Road area and Scaredman <br />
Campground are again under a closure order due to potential fire activity, and to keep the area clear for <br />
firefighting operations.<br />
<br />
·         The Umpqua and Willamette National Forests have area closure orders to encompass the Rough <br />
Patch, Jack, Archie Creek, and Devil's Knob Fire Areas.  The closure includes Canton Creek Campground, <br />
Musick Guard Station, and Cover Campground. <br />
<br />
·         Highway 138 between Roseburg and Diamond Lake and Crater Lake remains open.  Slow down and <br />
be alert while passing through the fire area. <br />
<br />
Chaos and Little Bend Fires:  Securing the west side of the Chaos is progressing well – burnout operations <br />
are complete on this flank of the fire and firefighters are focused on holding the fire in place to prevent spread <br />
to the west.  The primary containment lines of these fires lay on the west and northwest flanks.  Crews are <br />
working to the north from Canton Point through Shane Saddle and onto Bohemia Mountain to construct fire <br />
line to secure the Chaos fire from moving to the northwest.  Additional work is being done on the southeast <br />
side of the Chaos fire to prevent the fire from moving south then to the west.  On the Little Bend Fire, the west <br />
mid-section of the fire is contained and holding well.  Containment lines are complete between the Chaos and <br />
the Little Bend Fire and being reinforced with burning out of the fuels between the fires.<br />
<br />
Jack and Buckhead Fires:  The Jack Fire has containment lines that are holding on the west, north, and east <br />
flanks of the fires and these lines account for a large amount of containment of the fire.  The Buckhead fire <br />
has burned into the Jack fire to the north - fire crews are patrolling these flanks and taking action to hold the <br />
lines as necessary.  The southwest and south flanks of the fire are seeing moderate fire behavior – tactics on <br />
these flanks include direct dozer line, the construction of primary and alternate contingency lines using the <br />
road system, building and reinforcing contingency lines and conducting burnout operations as opportunities <br />
arise. <br />
<br />
Near Minky Fire:  This fire lays south of the Jack and Buckhead Fires.  The east flank of the fire has been <br />
contained. The nearby Smith Fire that is part of the Devil’s Knob Complex is actively growing to the northeast <br />
into Ash Valley.  Because of this, additional firefighting resources have been moved into the area to assist in <br />
containing the Smith Fire while looking for opportunities to construct containment lines for both the Smith and <br />
Near Minky Fires.  The Near Minky Fire is at 0% containment.<br />
<br />
Weather:  Winds over all the fires are predominately out of the northwest.  As smoke clears, fire activity is <br />
expected to increase. Gust up to 18 mph can further promote fire spread.  Afternoon relative humidity is <br />
expected to be in the mid- 20s to the upper 30s which will also promote elevated burning conditions.</span>

<br />
Yesterday: Fire behavior increased in the Little Rattlesnake drainage yesterday afternoon with several spot fires <br />
to the south of the Little Rattlesnake. Aerial resources quickly responded to slow the spread of the fire in the <br />
steep and inaccessible terrain. In the early evening, crews and engines initiated a firing operation on the <br />
southeast portion of the fire near Bethel Ridge. Firefighters took advantage of the cooler temperatures and <br />
higher relative humidity through the evening hours to methodically put fire on the ridge to begin to contain the <br />
southern portion of the fire and prevent the fire from moving south towards critical infrastructure and Naches. <br />
Meanwhile on the southwest flank, dozers continued improving and extending indirect containment line west <br />
toward the William O. Douglas Wilderness boundary on the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest.<br />
 <br />
Today: Firefighters will continue the firing operation to secure the southern edge of the fire. This firing operation <br />
could take multiple days to complete, as crews work along the indirect containment lines followed by fire engines <br />
holding the fire inside containment lines and monitoring and patrolling for potential spot fires. Meanwhile, dozers <br />
are continuing the work of extending indirect containment lines to the wilderness boundary. The construction of <br />
this line has been thoughtfully planned to connect roads with natural features in and around the 1500 road <br />
system, north of US 12. On the west flank, hotter and drier conditions increased fire behavior in the wilderness <br />
yesterday and fire managers anticipate similar fire activity in the wilderness today. Structure protection work <br />
continues along Bumping River Road and the Highway 410 corridor today. Crews are constructing and improving <br />
indirect fire lines around cabins and outbuildings near the Highway 410 and US 12 junction. As containment <br />
increases to the west of the Nile community, resources and equipment can shift farther up the Naches River <br />
corridor to continue structure protection and improve indirect containment lines in the area.<br />
 <br />
Due to the large number of fires nationally, there are a limited amount of firefighting resources. Firefighters and <br />
suppression resources will shift around the fire to protect communities, limit further fire spread, and focus their <br />
actions where they will have the greatest success. <br />
 <br />
Evacuations: LEVEL 3: Bumping River Road from north to south; LEVEL 2: Hwy 410 from Bumping River Road <br />
to U.S. Route 12. LEVEL 1: From U.S. 12 at Hwy 410 west to Tieton Reservoir Road; Yakima County Office of <br />

CANYONVILLE, Ore. – Firefighters continue to make good progress on the Skyline Ridge Complex, which is <br />
now 97% contained.  86 personnel remain assigned to the incident with the primary mission of patrolling <br />
containment lines, mopping up hot spots, backhauling the supplies and equipment that are no longer needed <br />
on the fire lines, and finalizing fire suppression repair projects in and around the 19 fires that make up the <br />
complex.  Foresters from both private industrial landowners and the Bureau of Land Management are also <br />
working in the fire area, assessing damages to their lands.  Resources that are no longer needed on this <br />
incident are either being reassigned to other fires in the region or returning to their home units for rest. By <br />
Saturday, fire officials with the Skyline Ridge Complex anticipate that only about 40 personnel will be needed <br />
on this incident to patrol the fires.<br />
<br />
Smoke from the interior portions of the Poole Creek Fire may be visible until the heavy fall rains return to the <br />
area. This smoke is being produced by smoldering materials and small pockets of previously unburned fuels <br />
within the interior area of the fire. These smokes are being monitored by fire crews but pose little to no threat <br />
to containment lines.</span>

Inchelium, WA – Northwest Incident Management Team 7 assumed command of the Summit Trail Fire today <br />
at 7:00 a.m. The Team is working with current firefighters and members of the Washington State National <br />
Guard to implement firefighting operations. <br />
<br />
Yesterday, on the south and west portions of the fire, firefighters continued mop up operations, cooling off <br />
burned areas up to 150 feet into the fire from containment lines. Fire crews also continued monitoring and <br />
patrolling around the fire perimeter for any new hot spots, and began backhauling pumps and hoses used <br />
earlier in suppression activities. <br />
<br />
The overall tactics for the northern and eastern flanks continued to focus on using heavy equipment to <br />
construct direct fireline, building handline, as well as a contingent of engines for mop up. Hand crews and <br />
dozers, supported by bucket drops from a large, Type I helicopter, improved containment lines in preparation <br />
for burning operations in upper Stall Creek and along Midslope Road down to Hall Creek. East and west <br />
along Onion Ridge, firefighters continued to construct direct containment lines where possible. Indirect lines <br />
were established in preparation for possible burnout operations where terrain and conditions were less <br />
favorable. West of Bear Springs, crews monitored fire activity as it slowly backed down to Hall Creek Road.  <br />
<br />
Today, sunshine will bring warmer temperatures to the region, with highs expected in the low 80’s. There is a <br />
chance of rain this evening into Friday morning. Firefighters plan to complete containment line preparation on <br />
Bittefoot Mountain and will monitor weather and fuel conditions for opportunities to burn small areas to <br />
strengthen the lines. Smoke may be visible from these areas. <br />
<br />
The Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation announced that the Colville Reservation will reopen to <br />
industrial activities and the general public on Friday, August 27, 2021 at 12:01 am.  <br />

<br />
Yesterday, crews made significant progress on securing containment lines on the north edge of the fire. <br />
Heavy equipment and crews continued to prepare lines to the south near Slide Ridge and were able to initiate <br />
a small firing operation in the vicinity of Forest Service Road 8410. Fire behavior was moderate, and the firing <br />
operation was successful. Crews maintained an overnight shift reinforcing structure protection operations in <br />
and around properties and homes.<br />
<br />
Today, fire behavior is expected to increase to moderate or active levels when the cloud cover breaks. Heavy <br />
equipment and crews will continue to construct line in areas with heavy fuel loads. Along the southern and <br />
western edges of the fire, crews will continue to construct line from 125 to the finger. On the northern <br />
perimeter of the fire, crews are continuing to improve the line working south towards Angle Peak while also <br />
monitoring and mopping up hot spots around homes and properties.Rotor and fixed-wing air resources will <br />
continue working on the fire throughout the day and improved weather conditions make the use of aviation <br />
assets more likely today. Aircraft may use local bodies of water, including Lake Chelan. Recreational boaters <br />
should be aware of aircraft takeoff and landings and keep a safe distance.The Twentyfive Mile Fire was first <br />
reported at 3:45 p.m. on August 15, 2021. The fire was initially burning on the south shore of Lake Chelan <br />
near Twentyfive Mile Creek and has expanded south and west of the area. The fire is under joint jurisdiction of <br />
the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest, Washington Department of Natural Resources, Bureau of Land <br />
Management and Chelan County Fire District 7.<br />
<br />
Weather: Cloud cover is expected to increase tonight into tomorrow ahead of an approaching cool front. A <br />
chance of rain showers will exist over the fire, primarily from Thursday evening through early Friday morning.<br />
<br />

The Chickadee Creek Fire is located approximately 15 miles west of<br />
Tonasket, Washington. The Walker Creek Fire is located approximately 13<br />
miles east/northeast of Tonasket, Washington, surrounding Lake<br />
Bonaparte. Northwest Incident Management Team 12 took over<br />
management of both fires this morning from the Rocky Mountain Blue<br />
Team.<br />
<br />
Operations<br />
Conditions were drier on both fires yesterday, although fire behavior did<br />
not increase due to relatively calm winds. Firefighters worked on<br />
constructing a hose lay around the northwest corner of the Chickadee<br />
Creek Fire yesterday. Fire crews performed a burnout on a portion of the<br />
northern perimeter of the Chickadee Creek Fire last night, and firefighters<br />
will work to secure containment lines in that area today.<br />
Walker Creek Fire operations yesterday focused on improving<br />
containment lines around the fire. In the southwestern portion of the fire,<br />
burnout operations supported hand crews working to build fire<br />
containment lines. Heavy helicopters dropped water buckets in the<br />
southwestern portion of the fire to support fire crews on the ground.<br />
Firefighters continued to work protecting structures and mopping up south<br />
of the Bonaparte Lake area. Operations will continue today on both fires,<br />
constructing direct and indirect fire control lines and cooling hot spots with<br />
water bucket drops from helicopters.</span>
