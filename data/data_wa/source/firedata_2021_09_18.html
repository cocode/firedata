 Firefighters made good progress on the fire yesterday completing a combination of dozer and hand line on the <br />
eastern and southern flanks. Firefighters conducted a successful burn operation on the southern flank, utilizing <br />
water drops from a heavy helicopter as support to keep fire from spotting. Helicopters also inserted portable <br />
water tanks to facilitate aggressive mop up on the southern flank.<br />
<br />
On the northern flank near Upper Valley, crews patrolled and <br />
<br />
mopped up 100 feet inside the perimeter, completing about 75 percent of the mop up on that flank. On the <br />
eastern flank near Egypt Canyon, crews have established hose lays into the fire, into rugged terrain inaccessible <br />
to engines. About 5000 feet of hose has been installed.<br />
<br />
Today on the southern flank near Dry Mountain, firefighters will work to fell hazardous trees killed or weakened <br />
by fire that pose a risk to firefighters and could threaten the fireline. Crews will continue a burn operation to clean <br />
up the line and will start to mop up the burn operation that took place yesterday.<br />
<br />
Today the weather will be warmer, with low relative humidity and higher winds. A light helicopter will be used on <br />
the fire for aerial reconnaissance. On the southern flank, crews will work to clean up the fireline by chipping and <br />
dispersing fuels with a masticator. Work will continue with fireline construction improvement and mopping up <br />
around the fire perimeter.<br />
<br />
Weather: A warmer day is forecasted with temperatures from the mid to upper 70’s with low relative humidity and <br />
high winds. There is moisture predicted to enter the area starting Saturday going into Sunday.<br />
<br />
Hunting Season: It’s September and that means it’s also hunting season. We are asking the public to be aware <br />
of the elevated hunting and fire traffic in the area as well as the closures that may affect hunters.<br />
<br />
Closures: There are closures in place around the fire area. These closures are on public lands managed by the <br />
Bureau of Land Management land and Forest Service. Please adhere to these closures for firefighter and public <br />
safety.<br />
<br />
For more information about closures, please visit: https://tinyurl.com/4z9an48h<br />
<br />
Prevention Message: Safety is our number one priority. Please continue to do all you can to prevent wildfires.<br />
<br />
The Malheur National Forest and the Bureau of Land Management are in an IFPL level 3.<br />

Bull Complex update for Friday, Sept. 17 <br />
<br />
                                 <br />
<br />
RIPPLEBROOK, Ore. – Firefighters continue to reinforce primary line around the Bull Complex as part of their <br />
first operational shift under the command of Northwest Incident Management Team 13.  Firefighters are <br />
continuing to focus on values at risk, including the Gold Butte Lookout. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
“We are working on continuing the full suppression actions initiated by previous Incident Management Teams,” <br />
said Incident Commander Brian Gales with Northwest Incident Management Team 13, which took over <br />
suppression efforts today. Some interior burning could continue into the winter before the fire is fully extinguished <br />
after the perimeter is contained. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
“We’ll be building on the investments made by the Northern Rockies Team 4 with indirect line construction, <br />
looking for opportunities to go more directly at the fire’s edge when it is safe to do so,” Gales continued. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Weather: Weather will be cooler today, with high temperatures in the upper 60s. Today will be the last dry <br />
weather day until Monday, as 1 and 2 inches of rain will fall over the weekend. The weather is forecast to be <br />
warm and dry early next week. <br />
<br />
Evacuations:  The Marion County Sheriff has issued a Level 1 “Be Ready” evacuation advisory for Breitenbush <br />
Hot Springs. Residents should be aware of the danger that exists in their area, monitor emergency services <br />
websites and local media, and make an action plan should the evacuation level rise. The advisory can be viewed <br />
at:  https://www.flashalert.net/id/MarionSheriff?alert=1.   <br />
<br />
Closures:  For the safety of wildland firefighters and the public, National Forests have enacted area closures that <br />
prevent the public from being upon National Forest System lands in the vicinity of the Bull Complex Fire. All <br />
Forest lands that are south and west of Forest Road 46, and east of the Riverside Fire perimeter are closed. The <br />
entire length of Forest Road 46 is closed. Lands within the 2020 Lionshead and Beachie Creek Fire areas are <br />
also closed.  See the closure orders and maps at https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/closures/7773/.  <br />

Cedar Creek, Cub Creek 2, and Delancy Fires September 10, 2021 Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest<br />
<br />
Minimal fire behavior occurred in the Cedar Creek Fire this week, with limited isolated creeping and some <br />
torching in the Varden Creek drainage and near Slate Lake.   On the Cub Creek 2 Fire, some creeping has been <br />
observed around the Farewell and Lake Creek vicinity. No activity was observed on the Delancy Fire. Cooler <br />
temperatures and higher humidities are expected across both fires this weekend, reducing the likelihood of active <br />
fire behavior and smoke production for the next few days.<br />
<br />
Crews and heavy equipment continue to complete suppression repair across both fire areas, repairing firelines, <br />
felling hazard trees along roads, chipping debris, and repairing roads damaged by suppression activity. The <br />
shortage of personnel and equipment nationally, plus the need to prioritize these resources for active fires with <br />
immediate suppression needs, have slowed the progress of this work on the Cedar Creek and Cub Creek 2 fires. <br />
<br />
Closure Area Update:<br />
<br />
In the Cedar Creek Fire area, the existing closure order remains unchanged for the next week. As of September <br />
10, the closure order for the Cub Creek 2 Fire has changed:<br />
<br />
·       Forest Service Roads 51 and 5160 (west of the Chewuch River) from Eightmile Ranch to Andrews Creek <br />
Trailhead are now open.<br />
<br />
·       Andrews Creek Trailhead and all trails leaving from this site are now open, including Andrews Creek, Little <br />
Andrews Creek, Coleman Ridge, and Fire Creek. Past Andrews Creek Trailhead, the road to Thirtymile Trailhead <br />
remains closed to allow for completion of road repair work that was scheduled for July but deferred because of <br />
fire activity. All other roads, trails, and trailheads in the existing closure order remain closed as crews continue to <br />
complete suppression repair and remove hazardous trees.<br />
<br />
·       Camp 4 Campground is now open.<br />
<br />
·       All other campgrounds, dispersed campsites, and trails in the Cub Creek 2 Fire closure area remain closed, <br />
including Falls Creek and Chewuch Campgrounds and the trail to Falls Creek Falls.<br />
<br />
Visit USFS Pacific Northwest Region Emergency Closures for locations and details of current closures. Fire <br />
closure orders and maps are also available here. As more suppression repair work is completed over the next <br />
week, district staff will re-assess the extent of closure orders across both fires to look for more opportunities to <br />
open areas and trails. Meanwhile, we appreciate your patience and respect for these closures to ensure the <br />
safety of our firefighters and visitors.<br />
<br />

<br />
Overall, it was a quiet day on the fire yesterday, the winds that were felt in Lakeview and the valley floors were <br />
not as brisk in the higher elevations on the fire. The south-southwest portion of the fire continued to experience <br />
the most active fire yesterday and through the night. Fire spread down the hillsides toward the pre-planned <br />
indirect contingency line. Firefighters worked the edge of the active fire area, putting in direct line with support <br />
from helicopter water drops. Helicopters will again support this area first thing this morning. The heavy <br />
equipment group continues to put in indirect line on the west side of the fire.  <br />
<br />
Aviation assets were available all day yesterday supporting ground crews with helicopter water drops on <br />
hotspots. Efforts of mop-up and cold trailing along the north, east and southern portions of the fire continued <br />
throughout the day. The northern end of the fire continued to be mopped up and patrolled. Firefighters are lining <br />
areas of unburned fuels within the fire, to protect from igniting and will continue today to do so. Protecting grazing <br />
ground that remain unburned remains a priority.  A helitack crew returned to work the hotspots in the inaccessible <br />
area on the northeast portion of the fire. Hose lays along the east and south side of the fire are completely <br />
plumbed and crews have much of the area on the eastern edge mopped in 10-25 feet and 100 feet on the <br />
southern end. Firefighters have now put in over 84 miles of hose on the fire.  <br />
<br />
Through the night, moderate surface fire with some torching was observed. Eight engines and a hand crew <br />
patrolled and responded to areas where the fire was active. A priority objective for the firefighters was to watch <br />
for spot fires. Hotshot crews spiked out over night near the fire, available to operations if needed to support <br />
nighttime fire activity. Tonight, additional engines, crews and a dozer will be out overnight working the fire.  <br />
<br />
Today, crews will continue mop-up efforts and the heavy equipment group will continue creating planned <br />
contingency line. The high winds that have been forecasted will arrive in the area this afternoon. Incident <br />
Commander Kevin Stock spoke to all resources on the priority of the day to be focusing on safety and only <br />
engaging when and where it’s safe to do so. Air resource managers will be monitoring the winds and are <br />
expecting the gusty winds to likely ground all air resources.</span>

Cedar Creek, Cub Creek 2, and Delancy Fires September 10, 2021 Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest<br />
<br />
Minimal fire behavior occurred in the Cedar Creek Fire this week, with limited isolated creeping and some <br />
torching in the Varden Creek drainage and near Slate Lake.   On the Cub Creek 2 Fire, some creeping has been <br />
observed around the Farewell and Lake Creek vicinity. No activity was observed on the Delancy Fire. Cooler <br />
temperatures and higher humidities are expected across both fires this weekend, reducing the likelihood of active <br />
fire behavior and smoke production for the next few days.<br />
<br />
Crews and heavy equipment continue to complete suppression repair across both fire areas, repairing firelines, <br />
felling hazard trees along roads, chipping debris, and repairing roads damaged by suppression activity. The <br />
shortage of personnel and equipment nationally, plus the need to prioritize these resources for active fires with <br />
immediate suppression needs, have slowed the progress of this work on the Cedar Creek and Cub Creek 2 fires. <br />
<br />
Closure Area Update:<br />
<br />
In the Cedar Creek Fire area, the existing closure order remains unchanged for the next week. As of September <br />
10, the closure order for the Cub Creek 2 Fire has changed:<br />
<br />
·       Forest Service Roads 51 and 5160 (west of the Chewuch River) from Eightmile Ranch to Andrews Creek <br />
Trailhead are now open.<br />
<br />
·       Andrews Creek Trailhead and all trails leaving from this site are now open, including Andrews Creek, Little <br />
Andrews Creek, Coleman Ridge, and Fire Creek. Past Andrews Creek Trailhead, the road to Thirtymile Trailhead <br />
remains closed to allow for completion of road repair work that was scheduled for July but deferred because of <br />
fire activity. All other roads, trails, and trailheads in the existing closure order remain closed as crews continue to <br />
complete suppression repair and remove hazardous trees.<br />
<br />
·       Camp 4 Campground is now open.<br />
<br />
·       All other campgrounds, dispersed campsites, and trails in the Cub Creek 2 Fire closure area remain closed, <br />
including Falls Creek and Chewuch Campgrounds and the trail to Falls Creek Falls.<br />
<br />
Visit USFS Pacific Northwest Region Emergency Closures for locations and details of current closures. Fire <br />
closure orders and maps are also available here. As more suppression repair work is completed over the next <br />
week, district staff will re-assess the extent of closure orders across both fires to look for more opportunities to <br />
open areas and trails. Meanwhile, we appreciate your patience and respect for these closures to ensure the <br />
safety of our firefighters and visitors.<br />
<br />

<br />
Yesterday, firefighters were successful in increasing containment on the Smith Fire by going direct on the <br />
uncontained parts of the fireline. In Division H of the Big Hamlin Fire, active fire behavior was observed, although <br />
it did not pose a threat to firelines because the activity was in the interior. In Division J, and in divisions of the <br />
Smith Fire, crews worked carefully along the edge to make sure that no heat remained close to the fire perimeter. <br />
During this work, extra caution is required because of the dangers from burned-out trees that are ready to fall, <br />
stump holes that are burned out, and snags. In preparation for the active fire behavior expected today, firefighting <br />
resources also continued strengthening contingency lines to ensure additional defense should embers blow over <br />
the fireline and get established.   <br />
<br />
Today, the progress of the last 10 days will be tested by an expected increase in fire behavior. Elevated behavior <br />
may result from low humidity, temperatures near 80 degrees, and 4-8 mph winds with gusts up to 20 mph. <br />
Firefighters will continue to implement work of the last several days, although they will be extra vigilant to <br />
changing conditions and observant of fire behavior. Despite the potential, fire managers and firefighters remain <br />
confident in their firelines. Fortunately, an extra backup plan is imminent as weather conditions will squelch fire <br />
activity across the area beginning Saturday. Rains are expected to begin in the morning, with significant <br />
accumulations predicted before Monday.</span>

<br />
The local Northeast Oregon Type 3 Incident Management Team, led by Incident Commander Steve Carlson, <br />
assumed management of the Green Ridge Fire today at 7 a.m. Future updates will be shared by the Forest on a <br />
recurring basis, but will no longer be sent daily unless conditions change.<br />
<br />
Green Ridge Fire Statistics: Size: 43,588 acres, Containment: 40%, Total Personnel: 114, Location: 30 miles east <br />
of Walla Walla, Reported: July 7, 2021, Cause: Lightning.<br />
<br />
Current Situation: No spots were observed yesterday. Areas that were burned out yesterday consumed nicely <br />
and created a buffer of black along control lines. Fire behavior was moderate as areas crept through unburned <br />
fuels with occasional torching. Winds pushed smoke and backing edge inward towards the black. Firefighters <br />
continued to patrol and mop up throughout the fire perimeter.<br />
<br />
Today firefighters will continue to focus on the southwest portion of the incident using direct attack. On the <br />
southern perimeter, firefighters continue assessments to monitor and observe fire behavior in remote areas. <br />
Firefighters also continue to hold and improve completed lines to the east, west, and south.<br />
<br />
Weather & Smoke Information: Overall, the westerly flow will continue through the week with chance of wetting <br />
rains by Saturday combined with cooler temperatures. Overall fuels conditions remain very dry and susceptible <br />
to fire spread. Smoke information is available on the Washington Smoke Blog at: https://wasmoke.blogspot.com/<br />
<br />
Forest Closures: Umatilla National Forest officials reopened most National Forest lands within the Lick Creek <br />
Fire footprint Sept. 9, 2021. Additionally, access was reopened into portions of the Tucannon River drainage. The <br />
modified closure can be found at: https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/umatilla/alerts-notices/?cid=stelprdb5286768.  <br />
<br />
Evacuations: Level-1 evacuations (be ready) remain in place in Garfield, Columbia and Asotin counties. An <br />
interactive fire map that shows evacuations and other important information is available at <br />
https://tinyurl.com/yv2sypd4.<br />
<br />
Temporary Flight Restrictions: For the safety of the firefighters and aircraft fighting the Green Ridge Fire, a 10-<br />
nautical mile Temporary Flight Restriction (TFR) is in place over the fire area through September 22, 2021. This <br />
TFR has a 10,000-foot ceiling. Wildfires are a “No Drone Zone.” Whenever a drone is spotted near the fire all <br />
aircraft are grounded until we can be sure the drone is clear of the area. For more information, visit <br />

<br />
Dry air will continue over the fire area today ahead of the awaited moisture system. Rain is expected to arrive <br />
late Friday evening through early Saturday morning. Its arrival will be marked by a sharp wind shift from the <br />
southwest(blowing from the direction of the approaching storm) with wind gusts expected up to 25mph. Humidity <br />
recoveries will be poor, especially on the ridges. This critical weather will increase fire behavior across active <br />
areas of the fire. Firefighters worked late into the evening on Thursday conducting firing operations with the <br />
emphasis on increasing and reinforcing containment lines along the northeast side of the fires. These actions will <br />
create additional reinforcement to the north and east side of the fire, providing the greatest defense for the <br />
expected southwest winds. Areas of the fire are expected to receive three quarters to one- and one-half inches of <br />
precipitation by the end of the weekend. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Chaos and Little Bend Fires:   <br />
<br />
The Chaos Fire is 27,218 acres and the Little Bend Creek Fire is 9,145 acres. Ignitions continued into last night. <br />
This tactic will help consume the unburned fuels in open pocket areas near the fire’s perimeter which will aid in <br />
securing the perimeter from northerly growth during today’s expected wind event. Crews were successful in <br />
conducting firing operations yesterday connecting the ground to the east between the fire’s edge and the 3829 <br />
road. Firefighters continued to tie direct hand line into the road and Horse Heaven Creek. This area continues to <br />
be the focus with the forecasted winds today. Blasting operations were successful yesterday in the southeast end <br />
of the Little Bend Fire - this provided opportunity for firefighters to safely open roads to gain access to what has <br />
proven to be a difficult area of the fire. Gaining this access was very effective in helping to secure this area of the <br />
fires edge. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Jack and Buckhead Fires:   <br />
<br />
The Jack Fire is 24,165 acres, and the Buckhead Fire is 6,962 acres.  Containment lines are holding on the west <br />
and north, and northeast perimeters. Firefighters continue to focus on the southeast side of the Buckhead fire <br />
and keep a close eye on the active area that is burning within a previous burn scar. The fire is burning in heavy <br />
down fuels producing intense heat and smoke, and slowly progressing into an area where limited fuels will hinder <br />
the fires growth. Helicopters are being used to help keep this area in check until forecasted weather moves over <br />
the fire. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Near Minky Fire:   <br />
<br />
The Near Minky Fire is at 4,869 acres. All containment lines are holding well, and there was no significant fire <br />
activity today. The Rocky Mountain Incident Management Team on the Devil’s Knob Complex is coordinating with <br />
the Great Basin Incident Management Team 2 to manage impacts from the nearby Smith Fire.   <br />
<br />
 <br />

In preparation for our anticipated rain event, the primary focus today will be addressing drainage issues – <br />
cleaning ditches and culverts, installing water bars on all indirect lines and pulling hose off contingency lines <br />
along the southeastern fire perimeter. Crews continue to haul fuels and logs off the western, northern and <br />
northeastern fire perimeter; this should be completed sometime today. When these areas are complete, the <br />
equipment needed to accomplish those tasks will be moved to Divisions Whiskey, Yankee, and Tango and will <br />
become the priority in these divisions.  <br />
<br />
Weather: Precipitation onset is expected late Friday night and will continue through Sunday night.<br />
Before expected rain comes in, we will experience a few hours of near critical fire weather conditions with winds <br />
picking up in late afternoon. Gusts around 20 mph are possible, with higher speeds along ridge tops.  We are <br />
anticipating a warm, dry day with cloud cover increasing in late afternoon and don’t expect any significant fire <br />
movement today.<br />
<br />
Smoke: Terrain driven winds will be light today, and the inversion will hold smoke at lower elevations.  Light <br />
ridgetop winds will be from the W/SW. Upper level winds will be more from the S and SW. This has the potential <br />
to pull smoke from fires in southern Oregon and northern California northward into the area again.<br />
<br />
Safety: Creating a defensible space can improve your home’s chance of surviving a wildfire.  Proper defensible <br />
spaces can also aid firefighters in their suppression efforts. Visit https://www.readyforwildfire.org/prepare-for-<br />
wildfire/get-ready/defensible-space/ to learn more.<br />
<br />
Closures: Numerous closures are still in place in the Willamette National Forest area. Firefighting operations and <br />
traffic conditions continue to be hazards within the fire closure area. Up-to-date closure orders and maps can be <br />
found here: https://www.fs.usda.gov/alerts/willamette/alerts-notices</span>

Dry air will continue over the fire area today ahead of the awaited moisture system. Rain is expected to arrive <br />
late Friday evening through early Saturday morning. Its arrival will be marked by a sharp wind shift from the <br />
southwest(blowing from the direction of the approaching storm) with wind gusts expected up to 25mph. Humidity <br />
recoveries will be poor, especially on the ridges. This critical weather will increase fire behavior across active <br />
areas of the fire. Firefighters worked late into the evening on Thursday conducting firing operations with the <br />
emphasis on increasing and reinforcing containment lines along the northeast side of the fires. These actions will <br />
create additional reinforcement to the north and east side of the fire, providing the greatest defense for the <br />
expected southwest winds. Areas of the fire are expected to receive three quarters to one- and one-half inches of <br />
precipitation by the end of the weekend. <br />

be the focus with the forecasted winds today. Blasting operations were successful yesterday in the southeast end <br />
of the Little Bend Fire - this provided opportunity for firefighters to safely open roads to gain access to what has <br />
proven to be a difficult area of the fire. Gaining this access was very effective in helping to secure this area of the <br />
fires edge. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Jack and Buckhead Fires:   <br />
<br />
The Jack Fire is 24,165 acres, and the Buckhead Fire is 6,962 acres.  Containment lines are holding on the west <br />
and north, and northeast perimeters. Firefighters continue to focus on the southeast side of the Buckhead fire <br />
and keep a close eye on the active area that is burning within a previous burn scar. The fire is burning in heavy <br />
down fuels producing intense heat and smoke, and slowly progressing into an area where limited fuels will hinder <br />
the fires growth. Helicopters are being used to help keep this area in check until forecasted weather moves over <br />
the fire. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Near Minky Fire:   <br />
<br />
The Near Minky Fire is at 4,869 acres. All containment lines are holding well, and there was no significant fire <br />
activity today. The Rocky Mountain Incident Management Team on the Devil’s Knob Complex is coordinating with <br />
the Great Basin Incident Management Team 2 to manage impacts from the nearby Smith Fire.   <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Closures:  Copies of all closures and maps can be found at https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/closures/7758/. <br />
<br />
The Umpqua and Willamette National Forests have temporarily closed areas of both forests due to the Jack Fire, <br />
Rough Patch Complex, and Devil's Knob Complex. <br />
<br />
Amended BLM Roseburg District fire closure: BLM road 24-1-26 (Francis Creek) from the junction with BLM road <br />
25-1E-31 (Canton Creek Road) North to the Roseburg District Boundary in Township 24 South Range 1 West <br />
Section 1 will remain closed. <br />
<br />
Highway 138 between Roseburg and Diamond remains open. Expect short delays for hazard tree removal <br />
operations east of Glide. Slow down and be alert.</span>

<br />
YYesterday and Overnight:  Fire activity picked up within the wilderness area (along the southwest portion above <br />
Rimrock Lake and around American Ridge) due to weather conditions causing some growth in fire size. Along <br />
the north side of the fire, firefighters continued to implement protection measures for structures in and around the <br />
communities of Cliffdell, Goose Prairie, and Bumping Lake. Firing operations were successful on the north/south <br />
containment line located about one and a half miles northwest of Cliffdell. As projected, fire activity slowly <br />
progressed down the northern flank of American Ridge. Crews continued to monitor activity within American <br />
Ridge which is also designated as wilderness. Along the south side of the fire, firefighters continued to patrol <br />
containment lines along road systems and implemented suppression repair efforts (e.g. road grading, <br />
naturalizing dozer lines that are no longer needed, installing water bars, hazard tree mitigation).<br />
 <br />
Today: Temperatures will begin a cooling trend with rain forecast, particularly on the west side near Bumping <br />
Lake. With the change in the weather, fire activity will likely diminish. Firefighters along the north side of the fire <br />
will resume patrolling the communities of Cliffdell, Goose Prairie, and Bumping Lake to provide structure <br />
protection. Additionally, crews will continue to improve containment lines within the Forest Road 1709 and 1706 <br />
area. Crews on the south side of the fire will patrol and monitor the area.</span>

<br />
The Summit Trail Fire Information phone number, email address, and InciWeb page will no longer be active after <br />
8 p.m. tonight. Any future fire information will be posted on the Mt. Tolman Fire Center Facebook page at <br />
https://www.facebook.com/Mt-Tolman-Fire-Center-1049496928435678. <br />
<br />
At 7:00 a.m. on Wednesday, September 15, the Southwest Area Type 2 Incident Management Team 4 will <br />
transfer command of the Summit Trail Fire to a local Type 3 organization, led by Incident Commander Lonny <br />
Cawston. This is the final update from the Type 2 Incident Management Team. Team 4 extends its sincere thanks <br />
to the local communities for their support and hospitality throughout this incident. Due to successful firefighting <br />
efforts, the Summit Trail Fire is now 85% contained, and resources are either demobilizing to return to their home <br />
units or reassigning to assist other wildfires across the country. <br />
<br />
Operations: Firefighters are achieving success along the northern portion of the fire, increasing the depth of <br />
existing containment lines by 100 feet and extending containment on both sides. Crews will continue to pull <br />
pumps, tanks, and hoses from this area until all property is accounted for. On the northeastern flank of the fire, <br />
crews are searching on foot for any remaining heat along existing handlines. On the southern side of Hall Creek <br />
near Bear Springs, vegetation continues to smolder in a few isolated areas, although the northern section is now <br />
secured. Although some sections of fireline remain open, natural features such as wet drainages and marshes <br />
are acting as natural holding features to prevent fire spread. Interior portions of Brush Mountain continue to <br />
produce light smoke, but no flames have been detected. Crews are working across the fire area to backhaul <br />
excess equipment and return it to identified staging areas. The Suppression Repair Group is grading Hall Creek <br />
Road north of Inchelium as timber is hauled to the mills in the surrounding communities. Air resources remain <br />
available and ready to respond if the need arises.<br />
 <br />
Weather: Today will be mostly sunny and rain-free with seasonably mild temperatures. A weak cold front will <br />
move through on Wednesday, resulting in a few more clouds and breezy winds in the afternoon. Thursday will be <br />
the last rain-free and mild day of the week with light rain and cooler temperatures expected Friday through <br />
Sunday.<br />
 <br />
Safety: The health and safety of firefighters and the public is the first priority. The public is strongly encouraged to <br />
stay safely clear of the active fire area. Firefighters are conducting operations under protocols to mitigate the risk <br />
of COVID-19.  <br />
 <br />
Smoke: Smoke from surrounding fires may be visible in the area surrounding Inchelium. An interactive smoke <br />
map at https://wasmoke.blogspot.com/ allows you to zoom into your location to see the latest smoke information. <br />
Smoke-sensitive individuals and people with respiratory problems or heart disease are encouraged to take <br />

<br />
Yesterday: In the northeast section of the fire, where a flare up occurred within the containment lines, firefighters <br />
concentrated efforts on wetting and mopping up hot areas. A helicopter made bucket drops while firefighting <br />
crews and four engines installed hose lay and mopped up any warm areas.<br />
Monitoring and patrolling containment lines continued along the perimeter of the fire. Chipping along the 8410 <br />
Road was completed. Firefighters also repaired and rehabbed hand lines from the end of Lakeshore Road to the <br />
west along the fire’s edge. Road crews continued to work on road repairs to ensure safe access for fire <br />
personnel.<br />
<br />
Today: Work on containment lines and mop up will continue. Weather permitting, rehab and repair work will <br />
expand on suppression damaged areas. Firefighters will continue to patrol and monitor the perimeters of the fire <br />
both by air and ground as weather allows. Chipping operations will be conducted along the 5900 Road.<br />
<br />
Weather and Fire Behavior: Wet and colder weather is moving in this weekend with most of the precipitation <br />
occurring Friday night into Saturday morning. Conditions are expected to decrease fire activity and the intensity <br />
of fire behavior. Fuels are starting to return to seasonal moisture levels and requiring more heat to start burning.<br />
<br />
Evacuations: Effective at noon on September 13, all remaining evacuation notices related to the Twentyfive Mile <br />
Fire were removed. For more information, contact Chelan County Emergency Management, or follow their <br />
Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/CCSOEM.</span>

<br />
Fire behavior on the northwest flank of Bonaparte Mountain increased yesterday. Wildland crews continue to <br />
monitor this area for fire movement as the fire burns to indirect fire lines.  Crews continue to patrol the perimeter <br />
of the fire as well as around houses for any remaining hotspots within those areas.  Additional excavators and <br />
other equipment have arrived on the fire and are being assigned to repair work on dozer lines and other impacts <br />
from suppression efforts.  Rehabilitation will primarily be focused in the Diamond Bell, Bunch and Fox road <br />
areas. <br />
<br />
Attention Hunters: The Walker Creek Fire area (within the 204 GMU) on public lands remains closed to hunting.  <br />
Please respect closed road signs in the area.  Crews are continuing with suppression and repair efforts around <br />
the fire. Fire weakened trees and ash pits still exist throughout the landscape. Please help keep our firefighters <br />
working on the fire safe and avoid the area. <br />
<br />
The USFS Bonaparte Lake Campground will reopen today after noon and will be first come, first serve (no <br />
reservations).  Lost Lake campground is currently still closed and being evaluated for potential reopening. <br />
Campfires are permitting on the USFS Colville-Okanogan Forest, but campfires are still prohibited on DNR and <br />
private lands. <br />
<br />
Rain is expected over the weekend, which will increase the possibility of flash floods, rockfalls, falling trees and <br />
possible debris flows or torrents within and adjacent to the fire scar area.  Water in stream and swale areas could <br />
rapidly rise or form into debris torrents within the drainage area and deposit on the valley bottoms below. Flash <br />
flooding and debris flows or torrents can impact areas outside of the fire boundary.<br />
<br />
Level 1 evacuation levels will be removed today in anticipation of rainfall over the weekend.</span>
