Summary: The Boulder Mountain Fire was detected on Wednesday August 31st, 2022, at approximately 8:30 pm. The fire is located in <br />
the Tacoma Creek and Boulder Mountain area, 9 miles Northwest of Cusick, Washington. A mix of State, Federal and Private land is <br />
impacted. The terrain is difficult, and the fire is burning in heavy timber, slash, and beetle infested trees. Cause of the fire remains under <br />
investigation. <br />
<br />
Weather|Anticipated Fire Behavior: Another day of poor air quality due to an inversion layer with thick smoke is in the forecast. High <br />
clouds will move in later in the evening and may bring a bit of moisture. Humidity levels will be rising. Wind will be light today coming in <br />
from the north. The heavy dead and down fuels and old timber are driving the current fire behavior.  With today’s predicted weather <br />
along with a shorter burn period, fire behavior is anticipated to be moderate. Fuels in the interior of the fire will continue to burn.  <br />
<br />
Actions: Firefighters continue to make good progress, containment is now at 21%.  Fallers have been actively working to clear snags <br />
allowing hand crews to lay more hose line and direct water deeper into the interior of the fire. Small scale burning operations continued, <br />
again helping firefighters to manage the fires edges. Aviation was able to work over the fire in the morning but limited visibility due to <br />
smoke became a safety factor by the afternoon. <br />
<br />
Today, visibility is expected to impact aircraft operations, similar to yesterday. Resources on the ground will take advantage of the <br />
higher humidity as they focus on mopping up the fire with hose lays to apply more water to hot spots along the fire’s edge working their <br />
way into the interior of the fire. Fallers will continue to mitigate hazards and will work closely with hand crews targeting hot spots as they <br />
access areas to increase containment. <br />
<br />
Important Information:  As a reminder, If you fly, We Can’t.  The airspace above a wildland fire can be a complex environment with <br />
multiple fixed and rotor wing aircraft operating at different altitudes. Fire managers put a temporary flight restriction (TFR) over wildfires <br />
to maintain control of the airspace.  It is important that the public remembers not to fly their own drones within the TFR of a wildfire. <br />
Drone intrusions endanger the lives of firefighters, halt air operations, and impact the protection of values at risk.</span>

Current Situation: The Lane County Sheriff’s Office lowered some evacuation levels yesterday due to changing conditions and progress <br />
on the fire. Evacuation levels in the communities of Westfir and portions of Oakridge were lowered from Level 3 (Go Now) to Level 2 <br />
(Set). High Prairie and the areas north, east, and southwest of Oakridge remain in Level 3 evacuation status. Fire officials will continue <br />
to work with local law enforcement to communicate fire conditions and keep the community safe. People who remain in shelters will <br />
continue to receive services provided by the Red Cross. People who have mobility limitations or are particularly sensitive to smoke are <br />
encouraged not to return to Level 2 areas. <br />
<br />
As the wind has died down, heavy smoke is blanketing the Cedar Creek Fire area. Oakridge has been experiencing dense smoke, and <br />
with the wind switch to the northwest, smoke has created unhealthy air quality for communities east of the fire as well, including Bend. <br />
To protect yourself from smoke, avoid strenuous outdoor activities and limit your time outdoors. <br />
<br />
A virtual community meeting will be hosted by west zone’s Northwest Team 6 held tonight at 7 pm. Join us on Facebook to learn more <br />
and ask questions. <br />
<br />
Status: Cooler weather aided firefighters’ progress on the west side of the Cedar Creek Fire. Structural taskforces accessed and <br />
prepped homes along the western side of the fire, then assisted with burn operations as winds became favorable. On the western flank, <br />
crews continued to mop up the burnout near Eagle Butte, northeast of Oakridge. North of the Waldo Lake Wilderness, on Forest Road <br />
19, crews worked to prep the Box Canyon area. Southwest of Waldo Lake, firefighters were able to hold Forest Road 5883 north of <br />
Highway 58 and the Rogue River hotshot crew was able to improve handline to tie into Forest Road 5897. A backing fire is slowing <br />
advancement on the southwestern edge. Firefighters continue to hold and improve all lines. Today, a structural group will head to the <br />
southern portion of the fire to assist with back burns along Highway 58 and evaluate structures near Odell Lake. While crews remain <br />
focused on protecting the communities of High Prairie, Westfir, and Oakridge, fire officials recognize the relative proximity of the fire to <br />
other surrounding communities and want to be prepared to support and protect those areas. <br />
<br />
In the east zone, efforts continue to brush the west side of the Cascade Lakes Highway to improve a fuel break and prepare for <br />
possible burn-out operations. The Cascade Lakes Highway remains closed to ensure public safety and the safety of firefighters. <br />
Infrastructure protection continues around Cultus Lake. In the southeast region of the fire, near Odell Lake, a new branch and two <br />
divisions have been added with crews deployed to brush around Highway 58. Highway 58 is closed from milepost 36 to 62. A new camp <br />
is being established near Cascade Junction to put crews closer to the southeast side of the fire. Expect to see more traffic and <br />
firefighting activity in the area. <br />
<br />
Weather/Fire Behavior: Winds are light and steady out of the west northwest. Dry conditions were aided by good overnight relative <br />
humidity recovery and scattered light rainfall. Temperatures will be more seasonal, in the upper 60s. Some torching and spotting fire <br />
behavior is expected over the next day or so, but most activity will be creeping and smoldering.</span>

Sedro Woolley, WA – Weather conditions along with dry fuels continue to increase fire activity on the lightning-caused Chilliwack <br />
Complex. Increased easterly winds, high temperatures, and low humidity throughout the area have prompted a Red Flag Warning from <br />
the National Weather Service through Sunday evening. On Friday, the Copper Lake and Copper Ridge fires merged, and the North <br />
Fork and Little Chill fires merged. The two fires are now known as Copper Lake and Little Chill fires, respectively. The Silesia Fire had <br />
significant growth and is approximately one mile from the forest boundary with the Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest. This fire <br />
activity has prompted the closure of the Silesia Creek Trail. The Chilliwack Complex is made up of several active fires (Little Chill, <br />
Copper Lake, Brush Creek, Silesia, and Little Beaver Creek).<br />
<br />
 Crews continue protection measures on a pack bridge and suspension bridge near the Brush Creek Fire and on the cable car <br />
potentially threatened by the Copper Lake Fire. Firefighters continue to utilize helicopter bucket work on the Little Beaver Creek Fire.<br />
<br />
<br />
The Washington Department of Ecology announced an Air Quality Alert due to current wildfire smoke from the fires in the North <br />
Cascades. North and northeasterly winds are moving into the area, pushing regional smoke impacts from fires into the greater <br />
Bellingham-Seattle metropolitan area. Increasing smoke impacts, reduced visibility and short periods of UNHEALTHY air quality are <br />
expected into Sunday. As southwest winds return late Sunday, smoke impacts will shift back into the Wenatchee, Chelan, and <br />
Okanogan valleys. Take precautions when recreating outdoors when heavy smoke is present. Learn more at Real-Time Air Quality Map <br />
| PurpleAir, airnow.gov or visit https://wasmoke.blogspot.com/.  <br />
  <br />
Trail and camp closures remain in effect due to fire activity. Closure information can be found at <br />
https://www.nps.gov/noca/planyourvisit/trail-conditions.htm  <br />

Weather: Today will be another dry day with relative humidity dropping into the 20s. Widespread smoke will persist in the area due to all fires Oregon and surrounding states. <br />
Temperatures will reach the low-80s today and winds should be calm. There is a slight chance of thunderstorms this afternoon. <br />
<br />
Operations: Yesterday crews were chipping and cleaning up along the FSR 45 and other containment lines. Chipping will continue today along FSR 45 north of Indian Rock <br />
Lookout. Crews have been successful mopping up remaining heat along containment lines; thus, the percent containment has increased over the past several days. Some small <br />
interior pockets of unburned vegetation could potentially flare up but should not threaten containment lines. Crews conducted suppression repairs on FSR 4555 and on <br />
contingency lines near Myrtle Butte and south of Indian Rock Lookout yesterday. Suppression repairs will continue today along several containment lines. Indian Rock Lookout is <br />
back now fully staffed.  <br />
<br />
Closures and Evacuations:  There are no county evacuation alerts, and County Road 20 (Middle Fork Road) is open to all motorists.</span>

Highlights: Firefighters and air resources continued their efforts to contain a fire that spotted across the west bank of the Imnaha River. <br />
Air resources dropped 56 loads of retardant on that fire since it was discovered Saturday afternoon. Oregon State Fire Marshal (OSFM) <br />
task forces worked in Big Sheep Creek to protect structures in the area. Crews are working to connect handlines to stop the fire growth <br />
on the west side of the Imnaha River. North of the Double Creek Fire, operations will begin implementing a fire line on the ridges to help <br />
keep the fire from impacting additional private lands.  <br />
<br />
Double Creek Fire: 155,297 <br />
<br />
The lightning caused Double Creek Fire is a full suppression fire, and the protection of lives and property remain the primary objectives <br />
of this incident. Despite the activity across the Imnaha River, OSFM crews remained focused on completing their structure protection <br />
mission in the Imnaha River Woods area. Crews worked on a contingency line south of the fire for additional protection. Work will begin <br />
building the dozer line in the north to flank the fire across the difficult topography.  Crews on the Snake River continue evaluating and <br />
prepping structures in Hells Canyon.  <br />
<br />
Eagle Cap Wilderness Fires  <br />
There are three lightning caused fires within the Eagle Cap Wilderness. The Nebo, Sturgill, and Goat Mountain 2 Fires are active and <br />
being managed to protect public and private infrastructure, while playing a natural role within designated Wilderness.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Nebo Fire: 12,365 acres <br />
Good progress was made on the Nebo Fire yesterday. Chippers began working on 39 Road and crews continued building contingency <br />
lines to the north of the fire. The dozer line to the edge of the wilderness was completed and hand crews continued with handline into <br />
the wilderness. Nebo resources continued assisting the Double Creek Fire yesterday. Chipping along the 39 Road will continue today. <br />
<br />
<br />
Sturgill Fire: 19,774 acres <br />
There was increased smoke production and single and group tree torching on the fire yesterday, but minimal acreage growth. Crews <br />
continued work on the shaded fuel break project and structure protection at Bear Creek Guard Station was completed. Firefighters will <br />
reassess the structure protection that is in place today, while crews continue to work on the shaded fuel break in the Lostine corridor. <br />
<br />
Goat Mountain 2 Fire: 531 acres <br />
Goat Mountain 2 Fire remains in monitor status and did move over the Lostine Rim. Air resources continued bucket drops on the fire <br />
yesterday to keep fire spread to the east. Firefighters will continue to monitor the fire by air and use buckets if needed today. <br />
<br />
Weather: Poor humidity recovery from the Saturday night resulted in drier than normal humidity Sunday morning. South wind prevailed <br />
through much of the day with gusts 15 to 20 mph on ridgetops. Lower elevations received light and variable wind, which limited smoke <br />
dispersion. Relative humidity values will be higher today with a minimum of 25 percent. There will be a chance of showers beginning <br />
Monday night, but widespread rain is not expected. Winds will be light and variable throughout the week. <br />
<br />
Evacuations: <br />
Level 3 “Go Now” is in effect for Fence Creek north to Dug Bar and Freezeout south to the 39 Road. Level 2 “Get Set” is in effect for <br />
lands west of Imnaha River to Bear Gulch Road, south of Highway 350 to intersection of power lines and Harl Butte Road; Upper and <br />
Lower Imnaha Road from Fence Creek to Freezeout; and for Lostine River Road from Fir Road south to Two Pan (including all <br />
campgrounds and trailheads). Level 1 “Be Ready” is in effect for lands west of Bear Gulch Road, south of Highway 350 to power lines <br />
and Harl Butte Road, and for Lostine River Road from Highway 82 to Fir Road.</span>

Overview: Located 1.5 miles NE of Packwood, WA in the Goat Rocks Wilderness on the Cowlitz Valley Ranger District. The Goat Rocks <br />
Fire is estimated to be 2228 acres in size. The incident was discovered on Aug. 9, 2022 and was partly suppressed by a rappel attack <br />
crew. Crews suppressed what they safely could, and the fire was monitored. On September 9, 2022 the fire began to increase in size <br />
during a high wind event. <br />
<br />
Size: Approximately 2842 acres <br />
<br />
Forest closures: US Hwy-12 is closed from Skate Creek and White Pass. Highway 123 is closed from US Hwy 12 to Ohanapecosh <br />
Visitor center in Mount Rainier National Park. Forest Rd. Additionally, 4600, 4610, 4612 and all connected spurs, and Trail #65 to Bluff <br />
Lake.<br />
<br />
Evacuations: Currently Timberline, Goat Rocks, and High Valley neighborhoods east of Packwood are under a level 3 evacuation, or <br />
Go status, and are required to evacuate. The remainder of the neighborhoods and businesses in Packwood is currently under a level 2 <br />
evacuation, or Set status, and should be prepared to evacuate. Evacuees should head to the White Pass School, located at 516 <br />
Silverbrook Road in Randle. Small animals are welcome at the school in a kennel or cage.<br />
<br />
Cause: Lightning<br />
<br />
Fire Operations: Yesterday the fire grew to 2842 acres but most of the growth was to the north and south. The fire has moved about a <br />
half mile closer to Timberline, but the fire is still 1.5 miles away from those structures. The fire has backed down from the mountain <br />
slowly and remained on USFS property. Fire was observed at the 4610 road where a fuel break was created earlier last week. <br />
Resources patrolled the evacuated neighborhoods, but had an uneventful night<br />
<br />
This morning crews will be back out on the line continuing to protect the structures in Timberline, Goat Rocks, and High valley. With <br />
weather forecast to moderate today, resources will continue to construct new and improve existing fire breaks. As these breaks are <br />
constructed, a box is being built around this fire to eventually contain this incident. Depending on the visibility due to smoke, aircraft will <br />
be utilized to help keep the perimeter of the fire in a smaller footprint. Additionally, the Northwest Incident Management Team 10 will <br />
begin managing this incident starting Monday, September 12, 2022.<br />
<br />
Weather: There is a red flag warning that remains in effect through 7pm today, September 11. Continued high temperatures and low <br />
humidity will persist and continue these critical fire conditions through today. This evening a stronger onshore flow will bringing in some <br />
higher humidity, lower temperatures, and a slight chance of some rain. Smoke will continue to linger in the area and with that air quality <br />
will be lower, especially in the morning and evenings as nighttime inversions settle in to place.<br />
<br />
Fire Restrictions: Campfire bans, and other use restrictions are in place across the Gifford Pinchot National Forest and much of the <br />
region.<br />

Plain, WA – Lightning started the White River and Irving Peak Fires on August 11th. The Minnow Ridge Fire cause is currently undetermined. These fires <br />
are burning on the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest.<br />
<br />
Suppression Strategy – Due to rugged and steep terrain, fire managers continue to implement a long-term strategy to manage these fires, including the <br />
use of primary and contingency perimeter lines for containment. Tactics include completion and reinforcement of fire lines utilizing forest roads and <br />
constructed hand line.<br />
<br />
Current Situation – A local Type 3 Incident Management Team assumed command of the fires on September 7th and is currently managing the White <br />
River, Irving Peak, Meander, and now Minnow Ridge fires. The Meander Fire is 6 acres with very minimal fire activity. Smoke may be visible over the next <br />
several weeks as interior fuels continue to smolder and burn out, and multiple fires burn region-wide.<br />
<br />
White River Fire – Acres: 2,577 (as of 9/9/2022); 1% contained; Location: Sears Creek area of the White River drainage, approximately 14 miles NW of <br />
Plain, WA.<br />
Fire growth primarily occurred on the south flanks of the fire. The fire footprint remains within the control lines and geographic features being utilized as <br />
containment lines. Firefighters continue to establish an anchor point, monitor activity, and maintain structure protection along Sears Creek Road and <br />
Windmill Lane.<br />
<br />
Irving Peak Fire – Acres: 3,226 (as of 9/9/2022); 7% contained; Location: Approximately 16 miles NW of Plain, WA<br />
The Irving Peak Fire has seen minimal growth over the last few days. Firefighters continue to improve roads used as containment lines, utilize strategic <br />
firing to establish control lines, and monitor fire activity.<br />
<br />
Minnow Ridge Fire – Acres: approximately 350; 0% contained; Location: Chikamin Ridge, approximately 14 miles N of Plain, WA.<br />
Minimal fire activity was seen yesterday. Fire resources continue preparation work around structures in the Chiwawa River area. Firefighters are scouting <br />
fire lines previously utilized during past wildfire activity to determine if they may be beneficial to the current strategy.</span>

Grangeville, ID – The Jones Creek Fire is burning east of the Snake River on public lands administered by the Wallowa-Whitman <br />
National Forest, about seven miles north of Pittsburg Landing. The fuels in the area are composed of primarily grass, with timber <br />
stringers. It was reported early in the morning on September 4th, 2022. The cause is under investigation.<br />
<br />
Status: Firefighters have increased containment to 90%. The fire has not gained acreage in several days. Northwest Team 7 will <br />
transfer command of the incident back to the Wallowa-Whitman National Forest this evening at 8 p.m. This will be the last update <br />
issued by NW Team 7.<br />
<br />
Yesterday two crews and an engine continued structure protection around the High Range cabins on the north edge of the fire. On the <br />
eastern perimeter crews continued mop-up and cold trailing to secure the fire’s edge. Cold trailing means firefighters search for hidden <br />
heat and move along the fire’s edge leaving cold ground behind them. Firefighters assessed structure protection needs at Pittsburg <br />
Landing, and patrolled the Snake River at the eastern edge of the neighboring Double Creek Fire to watch for spots across the river. <br />
Firefighting equipment that is no longer needed was retrieved from the fire.<br />
<br />
Today: Dozers are staged at Pittsburg Landing if needed to reinforce fire lines. The fire has burned to the Snake River along the <br />
western edge. There is no immediate threat to river travel or boating facilities. River users are asked to remain aware of the status of <br />
both fires. Firefighters continue repairing dozer and hand lines where the fire’s edge is cold. Repair involves creating diversions to direct <br />
rain water off of fire lines to prevent erosion and restore natural drainage patterns. Firefighters and two engines will continue structure <br />
protection work near the High Range cabins. Retrieval of firefighting equipment will continue today.<br />
<br />
Weather: As a ridge of high pressure strengthens over the area, warm and dry conditions will continue through today and early next <br />
week, with very low relative humidity, temperatures into the low 90’s and light, variable winds from the south and southeast.<br />
<br />
Smoke: Along with the much larger Double Creek Fire burning west of the Snake River, this fire has periodically filled the Snake River <br />
Canyon with smoke. Today expect smoke to be trapped in the valleys as stable conditions develop.<br />
<br />
Closures/Restrictions: As of August 5th, 2022, the Wallowa-Whitman National Forest has entered fire restrictions that prohibit building, <br />
maintaining, attending or using a fire, campfire or stove fire except within designated campfire rings at a developed recreation site.<br />
<br />
Evacuations:  25 homes in the Getta Creek and Deer Creek areas remain in a Level 1 “Get Ready” status.<br />
<br />
With high temperatures and very low humidity, any ignitions can become dangerous fire very quickly. There is a lot of fire season ahead <br />
of us. Please do all you can to prevent new fires.</span>

						    <span class="textarea">Increased fire activity on some of the lightning caused fires, burning in the very remote, steep, and inaccessible terrain in the northwest <br />
corner of the Pasayten Wilderness Area, spurred trail and area closures over the holiday weekend. Hot, dry, and windy conditions are <br />
expected today as a trough moves into the area which is expected to create conditions for increased fire behavior. The Shull, The <br />
Parks, Kid, Three Fools, Skagit, and Elbow fires, located near the Canadian-U.S border, are expected to grow in acreage today.<br />
<br />
In a joint delegation with the National Park Service, a National Incident Management Organization Team, NIMO Team 2, assumed <br />
command yesterday over the six fires now being called the NW Pasayten Fires, located in the Pasayten Wilderness on the Methow <br />
Valley Ranger District of the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest, as well as the Chilliwack Complex Fires within the North Cascades <br />
National Park Service Complex.<br />
<br />
A number of closures are in effect including an area closure for the Freezeout Creek basin and a number of trails and portions of trails <br />
in the area. Portions of both the Pacific Crest Trail and Pacific Northwest Trail remain closed at this time.<br />
<br />
Smoke from these fires, and other fires burning in the region, may impact north central Washington communities over the next few <br />
days. Take precautions when recreating outdoors when heavy smoke is present. Learn more at Real-Time Air Quality Map | PurpleAir, <br />

<br />
Update on individual NW Pasayten Fires:<br />
•     The Kid Fire, located on the ridge between Rock Creek and West Fork Pasayten, is approximately 8 miles south of the Canadian-<br />
U.S. border. The fire has been very active with spotting and torching of grouped trees. Yesterday, smokejumpers worked on protection <br />
of the historic airport cabin, situated about one quarter mile away from the Kid Fire, utilizing pumps and sprinklers. If conditions allow, <br />
smokejumpers will also be burning out unburned brush between the fire and the cabin.<br />
•     The Parks Fire is also very active. It crossed the border into Canada a couple of days ago. There is a Canadian Incident <br />
Management Team assigned to the Canadian portion (called the Heather Fire north of the border) of the Parks Fire. The fire is about <br />
one half mile from the Monument 83 Fire Lookout at the time of this release. Firefighters have prepared the lookout by wrapping the <br />
base with fire protective wrap.<br />
•    The Skagit Fire, located in Freezeout Creek 6 miles south of the border, spread northward and crossed over the top of the ridge and <br />
down the other side.<br />
•     Three Fools Fire, located 8 miles south of the border, is actively backing down the ridge and through an old burn scar, it has spotted <br />
north of the ridge. <br />
•     The Elbow Fire, located 6 miles south of the border, is actively backing down the slope near Skagit Peak.<br />
•     Tuesday, fire activity increased on the Shull Fire located 11 miles south of the border.</span>

MERLIN, Ore. – A few light showers fell on the Rum Creek Fire and vicinity late Sunday into this morning. This moisture was a remnant <br />
of Tropical Storm Kay, passing to the south. Skies are clearing again, and the next few days are predicted to be similar to today, cooler <br />
and more humid than the end of last week. <br />
<br />
“We’ve turned the corner and made it past the Red Flag events,” Incident Commander Trainee Rich Cowger stated.  <br />
<br />
Fire danger is still heightened, but the completed work makes the Rum Creek Fire unlikely to grow. Large fuels like logs are dry enough <br />
to burn readily, but the finer fuels that usually contribute to rapid fire spread are not as critically dry. <br />
<br />
Fire personnel continue to patrol the fire’s perimeter, searching for residual hot spots. Most of the fire’s edges have been cooled at least <br />
200 to 300 feet into the burn. Last night’s infrared flight detected little heat on most of the fire’s perimeter, and showed no acreage gain. <br />
Containment is now at 75%. <br />
<br />
The hot, dry and windy weather the last few days helped expose remaining hot spots, making some burn more actively and start to <br />
smoke. This made them easier to locate and extinguish.  <br />
<br />
Light rain also helps firefighters. Light rain has time to soak into the vegetation and ground, while heavy rain is more likely to run off and <br />
cause erosion. Any moisture, including high humidity and rain, makes the fine fuels harder to ignite and burn. Moisture from rain can <br />
soak into the ground, duff layer, and other fuels. If it contacts embers, it cools them and converts to steam. Today firefighters will be <br />
watching for wisps of steam, showing the locations of hot spots. <br />
<br />
In areas with a layer of ash covering the ground, ash will turn a darker gray as it absorbs rain. The water will evaporate over warmer <br />
areas and ash will turn lighter again. Firefighters watch for pale patches of ash and dig for buried heat under them. Some spots will be <br />
barely warm, but others will be hot coals. The damp ash and soil can be mixed with the embers to extinguish them, reducing the need <br />
for pumps and hoses to relay water. <br />
<br />
Fire hoses, pumps, and fittings such as nozzles can be safely removed from much of the fire perimeter. Surplus equipment is carried <br />
back to roads and other access points, then transported back to the Incident Command Post (ICP) near Merlin.  <br />
<br />
Most of the smoke in the air around the Rum Creek Fire and Josephine County is coming from other fires. Air flow is bringing smoke <br />
from Cedar Creek Fire near Oakridge and several northern California fires. <br />
<br />
Evacuations: Evacuation orders and notifications have not changed.  An interactive map showing evacuation levels according to <br />
address can be found at //JosephineCounty.gov/FireMap. For the most current evacuation information and resources, go to Josephine <br />
County Incident Information (rvem.org).  <br />
<br />
Road control: Josephine County Sheriff’s Office has established traffic access points around the fire zone. Road blocks are located at <br />
Galice Store; Bear Camp Road at Peavine (top intersection); Lower Grave Creek Road at Angora Creek (Grays Ranch); Quartz Creek <br />
Road about 3 miles up (end of County maintenance); Dutch Henry Road near Kelsey Creek (42 44'56.2/123 40'35.4); and Hog Creek at <br />
Galice Road. Only residents (must show proof of residency) and permitted users will be allowed through.</span>

<br />
A small amount of rain fell across the fire overnight, wetting fuels and settling dust on the roads.  Today, crews will take advantage of <br />
the higher humidity to continue increasing the mop-up depth into the interior of the fire.  Infrared devices were used again overnight to <br />
identify hotspots for day crews to mop-up.  Hoselays are being used across the fire to deliver water to cool and dampen fuels as <br />
firefighters dig out burning material.<br />
<br />
Due to burning of some interior islands and improvement in the mapping of the fire, it is now 2,539 acres.  There was no new growth <br />
outside the existing perimeter.   <br />
<br />
Significant mop-up has been completed around the homes in the fire area.  Crews are continuing to monitor and patrol around the <br />
homes checking for hot spots.<br />
<br />
Roads within the fire area are rocky, with numerous hazards such as rocks, ruts, steep terrain, and narrow roadbeds.  These conditions <br />
pose a significant safety risk for firefighters, which is being mitigated by driving slowly, using four-wheel drive if possible, and the use of <br />
spotters as needed.<br />
<br />
Residential traffic is allowed in the fire area, but residents are encouraged to drive slowly and be aware of fire operation traffic as they <br />
travel through the fire.  Bureau of Land Management lands in and around the fire area remain closed to the public.<br />
<br />
Cooler weather is expected to continue today, with the possibility of showers and thunderstorms.<br />
<br />
Evacuation levels continue to be evaluated based on fire behavior.  For the latest up-to-date evacuation information, please visit the <br />
Klamath County Sheriff’s Office Facebook page at https://www.facebook.com/KlamathSheriff or call 541-205-9730.  The Red Cross <br />
Evacuation Shelter at the Klamath County Fair and Event Center has been closed.<br />
<br />
Aircraft are available to support firefighters as needed.  A Temporary Flight Restriction exists around the fire to limit any aircraft not <br />
associated with firefighting activities in the airspace.  Wildfires are always a no-fly zone for drones.  A drone flying in the area can <br />
ground all operational aircraft and impact suppression activities.<br />
<br />
The Van Meter Fire started September 7th at approximately 12:30 p.m.  Cause of the fire is under investigation.<br />
<br />
A Community Briefing video was released by Oregon Department of Forestry’s Incident Management Team Sunday night.  The video <br />

September 12, 2022<br />
<br />
Plain, WA – Lightning started the White River and Irving Peak Fires on August 11th. The Minnow Ridge Fire cause is currently undetermined. These fires are <br />
burning on the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest.<br />
<br />
Suppression Strategy – Due to rugged and steep terrain, fire managers continue to implement a long-term strategy to manage these fires, including the use of <br />
primary and contingency perimeter lines for containment. Tactics include completion and reinforcement of fire lines utilizing forest roads and constructed hand <br />
line.<br />
<br />
Current Situation – A local Type 3 Incident Management Team assumed command of the fires on September 7th and is currently managing the White River, <br />
Irving Peak, Meander, and now Minnow Ridge fires. The Meander Fire is 6 acres with very minimal fire activity. Smoke may be visible over the next several <br />
weeks as interior fuels continue to smolder and burn out, and multiple fires burn region-wide.<br />
<br />
White River Fire – Acres: 2,577 (as of 9/9/2022); 1% contained; Location: Sears Creek area of the White River drainage, approximately 14 miles NW of Plain, <br />
WA.<br />
Fire growth primarily occurred on the south flanks of the fire. The fire footprint remains within the control lines and geographic features being utilized as <br />
containment lines. Firefighters continue to establish an anchor point, monitor activity, and maintain structure protection along Sears Creek Road and Windmill <br />
Lane.<br />
<br />
Irving Peak Fire – Acres: 3,226 (as of 9/9/2022); 7% contained; Location: Approximately 16 miles NW of Plain, WA<br />
The Irving Peak Fire has seen minimal growth over the last few days. Firefighters continue to improve roads used as containment lines, utilize strategic firing <br />
to establish control lines, and monitor fire activity.<br />
<br />
Minnow Ridge Fire – Acres: approximately 350; 0% contained; Location: Chikamin Ridge, approximately 14 miles N of Plain, WA.<br />
Minimal fire activity was seen yesterday. Fire resources continue preparation work around structures in the Chiwawa River area. Firefighters are scouting fire <br />
lines previously utilized during past wildfire activity to determine if they may be beneficial to the current strategy.</span>
