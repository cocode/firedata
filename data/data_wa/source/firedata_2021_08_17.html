<br />
John Day, OR – Yesterday, fire activity remained low on the east side. Today crews will continue to mop up <br />
and secure the control lines. Due to rugged and inaccessible terrain a UAS (Drone) with infrared (IR) <br />
capability will be used to locate remaining hot spots in the area that might otherwise be overlooked, starting <br />
on the southeast perimeter. <br />
 <br />
The fire continues to be active on the north and northwestern edge. Yesterday, crews were able to complete <br />
lines around the perimeter including the approximately 200 acre spot fire that had occurred. Lines will be <br />
actively monitored today as crews continue to lay hose and watch for spotting and slop over. Air support will <br />
be available as weather and ground conditions permit. Six helicopters were able to support suppression <br />
efforts yesterday. <br />
 <br />
Night shift will begin this evening and crews are expected to continue burnout operations to limit forward <br />
progress of the fire. Air operations may assist in a burnout today, in the northwest section, if conditions allow <br />
it. <br />
 <br />
Winds from the northwest will begin to pick up today with speeds ranging from 8 to 15 mph and gusts of up to <br />
23 mph on the ridgetop and exposed areas. Wind patterns will be heavily influenced by the steep terrains and <br />
may change directions. Gusts may also increase spotting distances from ¼ mile to ½ mile. Temperatures will <br />
remain in the upper 80’s today and smoke will begin to clear. <br />
 <br />
Closures:Recreation Sites within the closure boundary:<br />
North Fork Malheur River Trailheads both north and south, North Fork Malheur Campground, Crane Crossing <br />
Trailheads both east and west, Short Creek Guard Station, Elk Creek Campground, Sunshine Flat Trailhead <br />
and Trail, Horseshoe Trailhead and Trail, Sheep Creek Trail and Trailhead, Little Crane Campground.<br />
Currently the Trout Farm and Crescent Campgrounds are still open to the public.<br />

Bull Complex Fire Update August 16, 2021<br />
Fire Information Line: 503-668-1437<br />
<br />
 Overview: Throughout the day yesterday, good weather, cooler temps, and clearer visibility allowed for fire <br />
personnel to perform a reconnaissance (RECON) flight over the perimeter of the Bull Complex. This allowed <br />
for a closer examination of the fire area. Crews were able to obtain valuable information about current fire <br />
behavior and perimeter location.   Current Situation: After a hot and dry weekend, moderate fire growth was <br />
witnessed. Increased fire activity and growth continues to be observed along the northwest side of the <br />
Janus/Ridge Fire with minimal growth to the south and southeast of the fire. Crews along the perimeter of the <br />
Janus/Ridge and Kola Fires scouted for anchor points along Forest Road 63 and Forest Road 6370. Anchor <br />
points are strategically placed locations that firefighters use to start constructing containment lines.   Crews <br />
are scouting containment lines to the south and southeast of the Janus/Ridge and Kola Fires along Forest <br />
Road 6370. Crews continue to work on the west side of the fire along Forest Road 4696 improving <br />
containment lines.   Weather: Dry conditionspersist as temps remain inin the mid to upper 80s. Afternoon <br />
winds will slowly increase with gusts up to 15 mph. A warming trend resumes mid-week.   Smoke will continue <br />
to remain over the fire area and will be visible throughout the area. Affected communities should remain <br />
aware of smoke advisories and conditions. More information can be found at - www.airnow.gov or the Oregon <br />
Smoke Blog - https://oregonsmoke.blogspot.com/?m=1   Road Closures: Oregon Highway 224 is currently <br />
closed east of Promontory Park.    Area Closures:  Closure orders on National Forest System lands, roads, <br />
and trails within the Clackamas River Ranger District, Mt. Hood National Forest ORDER NO. 06-06-05-21-07 <br />
will go into effect beginning midnight August 16, 2021. Forest closures are still in effect from the 2020 Beachie <br />
Creek and Lionshead Fires within the Willamette National Forest ORDER NO. 06-18-00-21-09.   Restrictions: <br />
Building, maintaining, attending, or using fire, campfire, or cooking fire, is prohibited throughout the Willamette <br />

<br />
Bulldog Mountain Fire:  Yesterday the fire grew late in the afternoon with the change in weather that brought <br />
clearing skies and breezy conditions.  Firefighters worked through the night to keep the fire within established <br />
indirect containment lines.  Helicopters were called to work with crews on the ground to keep the fire west of <br />
FS Road 6110.  Heavy equipment continued working to establish contingency fire lines around the fire.   <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Today early assessments will be conducted on fire lines that have been established and adjustments to those <br />
lines based on the fire behavior observed.  Contingency fire line construction will be focused near Davis Lake <br />
and Deadman Creek.  Aircraft will be requested to assist if smoke conditions allow.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
The Bulldog Mountain Fire started August 5. 2021, located 20 miles north of Kettle Falls. The lightning caused <br />
fire spread quickly due to low relative humidity and unseasonably dry conditions.  The fire is burning in heavy <br />
timber and slash.  The fire is currently estimated at 2900 acres with 5% containment.  Acreage will be <br />
reassessed as more information is obtained.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Mack Mountain Fire:  The Mack Mountain Fire started August 5, 2021 and is just south west of the Bulldog <br />
Mountain Fire.  The fire has grown and is estimated at approximately 200+ acres.  Residents in the Deadman <br />
Creek area will see smoke from the fire.  The fire area is located in steep, rugged terrain with limited access.  <br />
Fire managers are surveying areas that may be used for indirect and contingency fire lines.  If visibility <br />
improves, fire managers will continue to use aerial reconnaissance to evaluate acreage increases and plan <br />
for future needs.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Citizens should remain vigilant and are strongly encouraged to sign up for alerts at Ferry County Alerts.  <br />
Motorists traveling on the Boulder Hwy should watch for heavy equipment and firefighters turning off and onto <br />
the roadway.  There are 174 personnel assigned to the incident. There have been two minor injuries with no <br />
structures lost.  Firefighter and public safety is our number one priority.  <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Level 1 evacuation orders and road closures are in place. For current evacuation orders please see Ferry <br />
County Sheriff’s Office Facebook page.  Boulder Creek Hwy and State Route 395 remain open.  For <br />
information on area & road closures on the Colville National Forest please see <br />
https://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fseprd938379.pdf   Citizens are asked to stay clear of <br />
the fire area and adhere to road and area closures. <br />
 <br />
Northeast Washington IMT 2 assumed command of the fire August 7th.  Fire information and the incident <br />
command post is located at Kettle Falls High School in Kettle Falls, WA. Fire information contact is Jeff <br />

Winthrop, WA —The Cedar Creek, Cub Creek 2 and Delancy Fires are burning on the Okanogan-Wenatchee <br />
National Forest and public and private lands within Okanogan County.<br />
<br />
Cedar Creek Fire: The fire has been mapped at 53,475 acres and is now 50% contained. Firefighters will <br />
continue mopping up the direct fire line in the Thompson Ridge area. Direct line will be secured from Highway <br />
20 to the rockslide area of Vasiliki Ridge. Fuel breaks continue to be constructed in the Twisp River area.  <br />
Night shift crews secured and held line last night. <br />
<br />
Moderate fire behavior was observed on the northern end of the fire yesterday as winds pushed spot fires <br />
back into areas of unburned vegetation. Mop up has begun on the northern flank after crews worked to <br />
secure direct line in the area.<br />
<br />
Today’s winds are expected to be gusty, west and northwest, in the afternoon through the evening as a cold <br />
front moves into the area.  Cooler temperatures, 70s in the mountains and 80sin the valleys are to be <br />
expected. Fire activity is likely to increase as the wind fans remaining pockets of fuel in the interior ignite.<br />
<br />
Cub Creek 2 Fire: The Cub Creek Fire is 67,458 acres and 55% contained. Moderate fire behavior was <br />
observed yesterday with short crown runs, short range-spotting and group torching observed. Smaller <br />
diameter dead/downed fuel moisture will reduce with direct sunlight through the burn period allowing for more <br />
efficient ignition.  The fire will continue moving north between the Chewuch River and lower slopes of North <br />
Twentymile Peak.<br />
<br />
Delancy Fire:  The 223 acre Delancy Fire has not moved for several days and is 90% contained. No heat has <br />
been detected for the second day of Infrared flights.<br />
<br />
Fire Weather: Expect gusty west and northwest winds in the afternoon and evening.  Much cooler air will <br />
move into the region today.  Temperatures in the mountains will be in the 70s and in the 80 in the valleys.  <br />
Smoke will be less prevalent as fresh breezes continue throughout the day.  <br />
<br />
Evacuations: The community of Mazama (west) remains in a Level 2 evacuation status.<br />
Evacuations: The community of Mazama (west) remains in a Level 2 evacuation status.<br />
<br />
Closures: For the safety of the firefighters and aircraft fighting these fires, a temporary flight restriction (TFR) <br />
has been placed over the area. Please consult the “Notice to Airmen” (NOTAM) at FAA.gov for specifics. <br />

A Community Open House for the Walker and Chickadee Fires will be today at 7 pm at the History Park <br />
Community Pool, 6 ½ N. Locust Way, Tonasket, WA.<br />
<br />
Walker Creek Fire: The Red Flag Warning issued for Sunday August 14 produced gusty southwest winds and <br />
increased the fire size by 6,000 acres. Those increases were in the southwest and northeast perimeters of the <br />
fire. The fire has not reached Beaver Canyon.   Around Lost Lake firefighters were successful in extinguishing <br />
multiple spot fires.  Clearing skies allowed aerial resources which included VLATs (Very Large Air Tankers), <br />
three heavy lift helicopters and water scooping planes (Super Scoopers) to make multiple drops to assist <br />
firefighters. Crews installed sprinklers and hose lays along the Bonaparte and Summer roads for structure <br />
protection.<br />
<br />
Today’s activities include continuing with structure protection, scouting a fireline location to bring the <br />
southwest edge of the fire to Highway 20, identifying roads, trails and natural features to construct fire line on <br />
the northeast perimeter of the fire and continued hot spotting. <br />
<br />
Chickadee Creek Fire:  Yesterday, gusty southwest winds pushed the fire northeast and increased the fire <br />
size by 800 acres. Today’s activities include scouting a fire line from the new fire area to roads, trails and <br />
natural features to limit fire spread.  Firefighters will continue to mop up and patrol the south and west <br />
perimeters of the fire to ensure it is cold. Hot spotting outside existing containment lines will also continue. <br />
<br />
Evacuations: Several communities have had their evacuation levels changed. Please refer to the Okanogan <br />
County, WA county wide advisory map for updated changes.<br />

Winthrop, WA —The Cedar Creek, Cub Creek 2 and Delancy Fires are burning on the Okanogan-Wenatchee <br />
National Forest and public and private lands within Okanogan County.<br />
<br />
Cedar Creek Fire: The fire has been mapped at 53,475 acres and is now 50% contained. Firefighters will <br />
continue mopping up the direct fire line in the Thompson Ridge area. Direct line will be secured from Highway <br />
20 to the rockslide area of Vasiliki Ridge. Fuel breaks continue to be constructed in the Twisp River area.  <br />
Night shift crews secured and held line last night. <br />
<br />
Moderate fire behavior was observed on the northern end of the fire yesterday as winds pushed spot fires <br />
back into areas of unburned vegetation. Mop up has begun on the northern flank after crews worked to <br />
secure direct line in the area.<br />
<br />
Today’s winds are expected to be gusty, west and northwest, in the afternoon through the evening as a cold <br />
front moves into the area.  Cooler temperatures, 70s in the mountains and 80sin the valleys are to be <br />
expected. Fire activity is likely to increase as the wind fans remaining pockets of fuel in the interior ignite.<br />
<br />
Cub Creek 2 Fire: The Cub Creek Fire is 67,458 acres and 55% contained. Moderate fire behavior was <br />
observed yesterday with short crown runs, short range-spotting and group torching observed. Smaller <br />
diameter dead/downed fuel moisture will reduce with direct sunlight through the burn period allowing for more <br />
efficient ignition.  The fire will continue moving north between the Chewuch River and lower slopes of North <br />
Twentymile Peak.<br />
<br />
Delancy Fire:  The 223 acre Delancy Fire has not moved for several days and is 90% contained. No heat has <br />
been detected for the second day of Infrared flights.<br />
<br />
Fire Weather: Expect gusty west and northwest winds in the afternoon and evening.  Much cooler air will <br />
move into the region today.  Temperatures in the mountains will be in the 70s and in the 80 in the valleys.  <br />
Smoke will be less prevalent as fresh breezes continue throughout the day.  <br />
<br />
Evacuations: The community of Mazama (west) remains in a Level 2 evacuation status.<br />

The Devil's Knob Complex is a group of lightning-caused fires with the majority burning on the Tiller Ranger <br />
District, Umpqua National Forest and on private lands protected by Douglas Forest Protective Association. <br />
The Devil’s Knob Complex is situated between the Rough Patch Complex and Jack Fire to the north, which is <br />
being managed by Great Basin Team 2 and the Skyline Ridge Complex to the southwest, which is being <br />
managed by Oregon Department of Forestry Team 1. The Devil's Knob Complex is managed by Northwest <br />
Incident Management Team 8 from an incident command post at the Milo Academy near Tiller, Oregon.  <br />
<br />
Great Basin Team 2 is scheduled to assume command of the Devil's Knob Complex on Wednesday, August <br />
18 at 6 AM.  Preparations for transfer of command are underway.  <br />
<br />
General Updates:  As fires become contained and mopped up in the southern portion of the Complex, <br />
resources are being relocated to the central and northern portions of the Complex to other priority fires. The <br />
Complex originally managed 40 plus fires and additional new starts. The total number of active fires on the <br />
Complex has now been reduced to 11 as a result of containment and control efforts and the merging of larger <br />
fires. <br />
<br />
The following is a summary of the significant fire activity over the fire complex starting from north to south: <br />
<br />
Smith Fire – 1,369 acres – mop up operations continue. The indirect containment line has been completed <br />
with final line preparations taking place today.   Contingency line construction options are also being explored <br />
farther east in case current containment efforts are not successful.  <br />
<br />
Mule Creek Fire – 1,024 acres – mop up operations continue. Fallers are checking for hazard trees as a <br />
safety measure for firefighters. <br />
<br />
Big Hamlin Fire – 5,359 acres – mop up along the western flank will continue. Successful evening burn out <br />
operations have reinforced line on northern and southern areas of the fire.  Firefighters will continue to work <br />
on hot spots in tributaries to Jackson Creek to prevent the fire from moving onto private lands. Old fire lines <br />
from the Whiskey Fire (2013) are being reopened and prepared for use as indirect containment line on the <br />
east flank of the fire, with nine miles completed so far. <br />
<br />
Little Applegate Fire – 135 acres –contained and in patrol status.   <br />
<br />
Wild Cat Fire – 215 acres – mop up operations continue. An unstaffed sprinkler system along the east flank of <br />
the fire continues to be effective and will continue to be operated in areas too hazardous for firefighters. <br />
<br />
Section 30 (Railroad) Fire – 76 acres – contained and in patrol status. <br />
<br />
Dismal Creek (444) Fire – 40 acres – contained and in patrol status.  <br />
<br />
The firefighting resources on the Devil's Knob Complex are also responsible for conducting initial attack <br />
operations on the entire Tiller Ranger District and private land holdings. Firefighters are prepared to respond <br />
to any initial fire starts. <br />
<br />
Evacuations and Closures: For the most up to date information on evacuation conditions, residents are <br />
encouraged to visit the Douglas County Sheriff Department's interactive evacuation map at <br />
www.dcso.com/evacuations where they can enter their address to determine what level they may be in. <br />
Residents can opt in to receive emergency alerts based on their address by registering at <br />
www.dcso.com/alerts. <br />
<br />
The Umpqua National Forest has implemented an Emergency Fire Closure Order restricting public access to <br />
the majority of the Steamboat, North Umpqua, and South Umpqua drainages due to high fire danger and the <br />
safety of firefighting resources in the area.  To view the Closure in its entirety, please see the Complex’s <br />
Facebook post of August 13, 2021.</span>

The Ford Corkscrew Fire started on August 15th at approximately 1:29pm.  It is located at Ford and 16.5 <br />
miles west-southwest of Deer Park. Fire behavior has been extreme, with the fire showing crown runs and <br />
spotting over ½ of a mile.  The fire was driven by wind, quickly spreading to the northeast, burning through the <br />
community of Ford and into the Rail Canyon area. The fire continued to move northwest towards Scoop <br />
Mountain. <br />
<br />
Yesterday, Stevens County Fire District 1, with mutual aid from Stevens County Fire Districts and Spokane <br />
County Fire Districts, along with DNR and the Spokane Tribal Agency responded to the fire.  Crews worked <br />
with numerous aircraft, from retardant drops from heavy aircraft to bucket drops from helicopters to protect <br />
structures and slow the progression of the fire.  <br />
<br />
Primary and secondary structures were lost in the Ford Community as well as in Rail Canyon. Fire behavior is <br />
expected to continue to be wind driven, progressing the fire to the northeast and east later in the day. The fire <br />
is cresting over the Five Sisters and Bald Mountain and is anticipated to move into the Williams Valley Area <br />
and into Scotts Valley Area.       <br />
<br />
Northeast Interagency Incident Management Type 3 Team 1 assumed command of the fire at 6:00am on <br />
August 16th, 2021.</span>

<br />
Lakeview, Ore.  –  The Fox Complex, which includes the Patton Meadow and Willow Valley fires, is now under <br />
the unified command of Oregon Department of Forestry’s Incident Management Team 3 and Oregon State <br />
Fire <br />
Marshal’s Blue Team.<br />
<br />
The arrival of the two teams brings in additional overhead capacity and firefighting resources. The teams are <br />
setting up their incident command post at the Lake County Fairgrounds and working on arrangements for a <br />
forward operating base for crews and amenities to support them.<br />
<br />
The Patton Meadow Fire is burning on the Fremont-Winema National Forest and private lands protected by <br />
the <br />
Oregon Department of Forestry about 10 miles west of Lakeview. Fire behavior picked up overnight as winds <br />
out <br />
of the north pushed the fire over and to the south of Highway 140 and west of the 383 road. Night crews and <br />
dozers were able to corral the fire in both areas and will continue to strengthen those lines throughout today. <br />
Current mapping shows the fire at about 4,100 acres.<br />
<br />
OSFM’s Blue Team is supporting the effort by providing structure protection around homes along Hwy 140 <br />
with 7 <br />
structural taskforces and 2 more taskforces arriving today. The crews will assess homes, create defensible <br />
space <br />
around the homes when feasible, and assist wildland firefighting crews in creating containment lines that will <br />
help <br />
protect structures.<br />
<br />
The Willow Valley Fire, about 16 miles south of Bonanza, is estimated at about 770 acres. The fire is burning <br />
mostly on Bureau of Land Management (BLM) Lakeview District lands north of the Stateline, as well as part of <br />
the Modoc National Forest to the south.  ODF protected lands are threatened. No structures are threatened <br />
on <br />
the Willow Valley Fire.<br />
<br />
With the teams still getting established, resources are on order and beginning to trickle in. Four large, type 1 <br />
helicopters are also expected to arrive this afternoon.<br />
<br />
Lake County Sheriff’s Office is managing evacuation levels. Level 1, 2 and 3 evacuation notifications are in <br />
place <br />
within and around the fire area. Stay up to date on evacuation levels by visiting <br />

Green Ridge Fire Containment Increases to 19% Despite Increased Winds<br />
<br />
Current Situation: Green Ridge Fire: Despite increased wind speeds yesterday, the Green Ridge Fire saw <br />
little growth and containment increased to 19%. The fire is currently 36,328 acres, with the additional acreage <br />
gained on the southern portion of the fire in Branch II. Yesterday’s gusty winds tested the fire line along the 22 <br />
(4022) Road in Division M and fire lines held, keeping the fire in its existing footprint to the north. Divisions G <br />
and K were combined into Division K in Branch I. Division K now includes the area along the Kendall Skyline <br />
Road and the western portion of the 22 (4022) Road. The area in the southeast corner of the fire near Oregon <br />
Butte is now Division W, replacing Division A. The area south of the fire previously known as Division P is now <br />
Division S. Division P is currently the area to the south of the Lick Creek Fire. Please see attached map to <br />
see the new division breaks on the landscape. Additional containment line was added on the southeast <br />
perimeter of the fire on the Kendall Skyline Road and on the eastern portion of the fire along Mountain Road <br />
where the Lick Creek Fire and the Green Ridge Fire burned together.<br />
<br />
Today, the fire is expected to continue moving to the south burning unburned pockets of fuel between the <br />
fingers that have burned south towards Mt. Misery, Diamond Peak and other points along the fire’s southern <br />
perimeter. Firefighters will continue to patrol and improve the fire lines in Division K, engaging in areas where <br />
the fire still retains heat along the line. Firefighters will also continue to patrol the fire lines in Division M, <br />
prepared to engage any possible growth from the fire’s existing boundary. In Branch II, firefighters will <br />
continue to scout for possible contingency lines to the southeast of the Green Ridge fire perimeter in Division <br />
P. Construction of indirect fire line is expected to begin later this week.<br />
<br />
Current Situation: Lick Creek Fire: The Lick Creek fire remains 80,421 acres and 97% contained. The <br />
remaining uncontained line is on West Mountain Road, east of Misery Springs campground. Fuels are <br />
expected to smolder and torch within the interior of the fire perimeter, which might result in increased smoke. <br />
Firefighters will continue to monitor containment lines and mop up any interior pockets of heat where it is safe <br />
to do so.<br />
<br />
Weather & Smoke Information: A cooling trend is expected to begin today with gusty west-southwest winds. <br />
These gusty winds are expected to reduce the smoke density in the area. West-southwest winds are <br />
expected to be 9-13 mph, with gusts to 25 mph. Temperatures will be 75-80 degrees along the ridges and 86-<br />
91 degrees in the valley bottoms. Smoke information is available on Washington Smoke Blog at: <br />
https://wasmoke.blogspot.com/<br />
<br />
Forest Closures: Closures are in place on the Umatilla National Forest. The forest closure for some areas on <br />
the Umatilla NF have been amended. The amended order reopened most Umatilla NF lands in Oregon. The <br />
order also closed all lands on the Walla Walla Ranger District in Washington; forest lands in the Pomeroy <br />
Ranger District will remain closed to entry. the order is available at https://go.usa.gov/xFyhn.<br />
<br />
Evacuations: Garfield County currently has Level 1, 2 and 3 evacuations in place. Level 1 evacuations were <br />
added on Thursday for Grouse Flats in southern Garfield County. Columbia County currently has Level 3, <br />
Level 2, and Level 1 evacuations in place. The Grouse Flats area is currently under a Level 1 evacuation in <br />
Garfield County, Asotin County, and Wallowa County, Oregon. An interactive fire map that shows evacuations <br />
and other important information is available at https://tinyurl.com/yv2sypd4.</span>

GLIDE, Ore. – Fire crews made headway bolstering the containment lines on the Chaos Fire, while keeping it <br />
from moving farther west or south.  Work will continue today on mopping up along containment lines, <br />
conducting direct attack where feasible, and indirect attack where appropriate based on weather, fuels, and <br />
topography. Firefighter and the public safety are always a priority during wildland fire fighting operations. <br />
<br />
Operations on the Jack Fire will focus on strengthening containment lines while working on additional indirect <br />
lines to keep the fire from moving west. The South Chilcoot Fire are now in patrol status, firefighters will <br />
continue to monitor the containment lines ensuring they remain secure. Throughout the fire zones, firefighters <br />
are working to secure and reinforce about 70 miles of primary, alternate and contingency line, while also <br />
suppressing fires that have crossed containment lines and engage any spot fires. <br />
<br />
Great Basin Team 2, a Type 1 Incident Management Team led by Tony DeMasters, has assumed command of <br />
the Rough Patch Complex and Jack Fire at 7 a.m. Sunday Aug. 16. Great Basin Team 2 would like to thank <br />
fire managers from NW13 for the hard work they have put into managing these fires. <br />
<br />
Fire activity continued to be subdued Saturday due to a temperature inversion holding the smoke near the <br />
ground, causing limited visibility and hampering flight operations. Weather conditions are forecasted to begin <br />
cooling with smoke starting to lift Sunday afternoon and clearing out by Wednesday.  <br />
<br />
Friday, the Umpqua and Willamette National Forests updated existing closure orders to encompass the <br />
Rough Patch, Jack, Archie Creek and Devil's Knob Fire Areas. This includes Canton Creek Campground, <br />
Musick Guard Station and Cover Campground. <br />
<br />
Roseburg District Bureau of Land Management has expanded its closure area to include the Scaredman <br />
Recreation Site. Francis Creek Road from the junction with Canton Creek Road north to the district boundary <br />
has been closed since Aug. 5.</span>

Middle Fork Complex & Knoll Fire Update – Monday, August 16, 2021 – 9:00 am <br />
<br />
Kwis Fire: Yesterday’s fire activity was limited and occurred within the perimeter. Firefighters are continuing to <br />
grid and mop up to secure containment lines constructed around the fire. This process includes systematically <br />
searching for hot spots by extinguishing or removing any burning material near the fire line. Heavy equipment <br />
will continue establishing alternate lines further away from the fire’s edge.  <br />
<br />
Knoll Fire: The Knoll Fire has remained within its existing footprint and will be managed by the Willamette <br />
National Forest effective today.  <br />
<br />
Gales and Ninemile Fires: Yesterday, smoke cleared enough to allow helicopters to fly, they dropped water to <br />
slow fire growth around the Platt Creek area on the northeast corner of Ninemile Fire while firefighters worked <br />
to prepare containment line along Forest Road 1832. <br />
<br />
Helicopters also dropped water to aid burnout operations on the Gales Fire. Preparation of Forest Road 1824 <br />
is complete. To make the road more effective as a containment line, firefighters are adding depth to the line by <br />
strategically burning to consume vegetation between the road and the fire. <br />
<br />
Preparation of containment lines along Forest Road 18 and other key road systems will continue today. Crews <br />
will continue burnout operations west of the Gales Fire as conditions allow. Additional heavy equipment and <br />
other specialized resources are being assigned to the Gales and Ninemile fires.  <br />
<br />
Structure Protection: One Oregon State Fire Marshal (OSFM) Task Force will be working the Gales Fire today, <br />
rechecking assessed structures in the Level 3 Evacuation Zone and patrolling the perimeter of the fire.  Crews <br />
will also patrol the Kwis Fire and be available to wildland partners where needs arise. Fire protection is <br />
scheduled to transition back to the local district on Tuesday, August 17, 2021.  OSFM task forces will <br />
complete their shift prior to returning  to their home agencies, their families and their communities.  <br />
<br />
Evacuations: Level 1, 2 and 3 evacuation notices have been issued by Lane County. For current evacuation <br />
information and an interactive map of evacuation areas, visit: www.lanecounty.org. Linn County has also <br />
issued a Level 1 evacuation notice for the Knoll Fire; more information is available at: https://buff.ly/3CutPQR.  <br />
<br />
Closures: Some National Forest System lands near the Middle Fork Complex and Knoll Fires are temporarily <br />
closed to provide for public safety. For more information, visit www.fs.usda.gov/willamette. Oregon State <br />
Marine Board issued a temporary closure on a portion of the McKenzie River, for more information: <br />
https://www.flashalert.net/id/OSMB. <br />

Green Ridge Fire Containment Increases to 19% Despite Increased Winds<br />
<br />
Current Situation: Green Ridge Fire: Despite increased wind speeds yesterday, the Green Ridge Fire saw <br />
little growth and containment increased to 19%. The fire is currently 36,328 acres, with the additional acreage <br />
gained on the southern portion of the fire in Branch II. Yesterday’s gusty winds tested the fire line along the 22 <br />
(4022) Road in Division M and fire lines held, keeping the fire in its existing footprint to the north. Divisions G <br />
and K were combined into Division K in Branch I. Division K now includes the area along the Kendall Skyline <br />
Road and the western portion of the 22 (4022) Road. The area in the southeast corner of the fire near Oregon <br />
Butte is now Division W, replacing Division A. The area south of the fire previously known as Division P is now <br />
Division S. Division P is currently the area to the south of the Lick Creek Fire. Please see attached map to <br />
see the new division breaks on the landscape. Additional containment line was added on the southeast <br />
perimeter of the fire on the Kendall Skyline Road and on the eastern portion of the fire along Mountain Road <br />
where the Lick Creek Fire and the Green Ridge Fire burned together.<br />
<br />
Today, the fire is expected to continue moving to the south burning unburned pockets of fuel between the <br />
fingers that have burned south towards Mt. Misery, Diamond Peak and other points along the fire’s southern <br />
perimeter. Firefighters will continue to patrol and improve the fire lines in Division K, engaging in areas where <br />
the fire still retains heat along the line. Firefighters will also continue to patrol the fire lines in Division M, <br />
prepared to engage any possible growth from the fire’s existing boundary. In Branch II, firefighters will <br />
continue to scout for possible contingency lines to the southeast of the Green Ridge fire perimeter in Division <br />
P. Construction of indirect fire line is expected to begin later this week.<br />
<br />
Current Situation: Lick Creek Fire: The Lick Creek fire remains 80,421 acres and 97% contained. The <br />
remaining uncontained line is on West Mountain Road, east of Misery Springs campground. Fuels are <br />
expected to smolder and torch within the interior of the fire perimeter, which might result in increased smoke. <br />
Firefighters will continue to monitor containment lines and mop up any interior pockets of heat where it is safe <br />
to do so.<br />
<br />
Weather & Smoke Information: A cooling trend is expected to begin today with gusty west-southwest winds. <br />
These gusty winds are expected to reduce the smoke density in the area. West-southwest winds are <br />
expected to be 9-13 mph, with gusts to 25 mph. Temperatures will be 75-80 degrees along the ridges and 86-<br />
91 degrees in the valley bottoms. Smoke information is available on Washington Smoke Blog at: <br />
https://wasmoke.blogspot.com/<br />
<br />
Forest Closures: Closures are in place on the Umatilla National Forest. The forest closure for some areas on <br />
the Umatilla NF have been amended. The amended order reopened most Umatilla NF lands in Oregon. The <br />
order also closed all lands on the Walla Walla Ranger District in Washington; forest lands in the Pomeroy <br />
Ranger District will remain closed to entry. the order is available at https://go.usa.gov/xFyhn.<br />
<br />
Evacuations: Garfield County currently has Level 1, 2 and 3 evacuations in place. Level 1 evacuations were <br />
added on Thursday for Grouse Flats in southern Garfield County. Columbia County currently has Level 3, <br />
Level 2, and Level 1 evacuations in place. The Grouse Flats area is currently under a Level 1 evacuation in <br />
Garfield County, Asotin County, and Wallowa County, Oregon. An interactive fire map that shows evacuations <br />
and other important information is available at https://tinyurl.com/yv2sypd4.</span>

Middle Fork Complex & Knoll Fire Update – Monday, August 16, 2021 – 9:00 am <br />
<br />
Kwis Fire: Yesterday’s fire activity was limited and occurred within the perimeter. Firefighters are continuing to <br />
grid and mop up to secure containment lines constructed around the fire. This process includes systematically <br />
searching for hot spots by extinguishing or removing any burning material near the fire line. Heavy equipment <br />
will continue establishing alternate lines further away from the fire’s edge.  <br />
<br />
Knoll Fire: The Knoll Fire has remained within its existing footprint and will be managed by the Willamette <br />
National Forest effective today.  <br />
<br />
Gales and Ninemile Fires: Yesterday, smoke cleared enough to allow helicopters to fly, they dropped water to <br />
slow fire growth around the Platt Creek area on the northeast corner of Ninemile Fire while firefighters worked <br />
to prepare containment line along Forest Road 1832. <br />
<br />
Helicopters also dropped water to aid burnout operations on the Gales Fire. Preparation of Forest Road 1824 <br />
is complete. To make the road more effective as a containment line, firefighters are adding depth to the line by <br />
strategically burning to consume vegetation between the road and the fire. <br />
<br />
Preparation of containment lines along Forest Road 18 and other key road systems will continue today. Crews <br />
will continue burnout operations west of the Gales Fire as conditions allow. Additional heavy equipment and <br />
other specialized resources are being assigned to the Gales and Ninemile fires.  <br />
<br />
Structure Protection: One Oregon State Fire Marshal (OSFM) Task Force will be working the Gales Fire today, <br />
rechecking assessed structures in the Level 3 Evacuation Zone and patrolling the perimeter of the fire.  Crews <br />
will also patrol the Kwis Fire and be available to wildland partners where needs arise. Fire protection is <br />
scheduled to transition back to the local district on Tuesday, August 17, 2021.  OSFM task forces will <br />
complete their shift prior to returning  to their home agencies, their families and their communities.  <br />
<br />
Evacuations: Level 1, 2 and 3 evacuation notices have been issued by Lane County. For current evacuation <br />
information and an interactive map of evacuation areas, visit: www.lanecounty.org. Linn County has also <br />
issued a Level 1 evacuation notice for the Knoll Fire; more information is available at: https://buff.ly/3CutPQR.  <br />
<br />
Closures: Some National Forest System lands near the Middle Fork Complex and Knoll Fires are temporarily <br />
closed to provide for public safety. For more information, visit www.fs.usda.gov/willamette. Oregon State <br />
Marine Board issued a temporary closure on a portion of the McKenzie River, for more information: <br />
https://www.flashalert.net/id/OSMB. <br />

The Muckamuck Fire started on August 4, 2021. It is located approximately 4 miles northwest of Conconully, <br />
Washington in the area of Pelican Pass and Muckamuck Mountain. It is on lands managed by the Colville <br />
National Forest. There are trail, area, and road closures in effect. <br />
<br />
The fire is in an area that has not burned in recent years. Decadent mixed conifer with dead and down <br />
materials are the primary fuel source along with open ponderosa pine, sagebrush, and cured grass meadows.<br />
<br />
California Interagency Incident Management Team 2 (CIIMT2) under the command of Mike Minton assumed <br />
command of the Muckamuck, Cub Creek 2, Cedar Creek and Delancy Fires on August 13th. <br />
<br />
Please note there was substantial growth to the Muckamuck Fire last night after the public information map <br />
was produced for today’s operational shift. Please refer to today's operational briefing video posted on <br />

 News Release August 16, 2021 Please Note: Final Nine Mine Fire update will be posted on Tuesday August <br />
17, 2021 <br />
<br />
Orient, WA - The Nine Mine Fire is located 4.5 miles south/southeast of Laurier, WA. This lightning caused fire <br />
started on Wednesday, August 4th and has a burned approximately 164 acres of forested land.   <br />
Evacuations: Yesterday evening the Level 2 evacuation for 3733 A-Z, N. Sand Creek Rd was lifted and is now <br />
in Level 1 status.  The remaining Sand Creek addresses and Imperial Way remain under level 1 evacuation.   <br />
Road Closures: No closures  <br />
<br />
Yesterday During the day, firefighters continued extinguishing hotspots along the northwest, north, and <br />
northeast portions of the fire. Firefighters using ground based infrared (IR) detectors found very few hotspots <br />
along the eastern perimeter of the fire, so fire managers extended the eastern containment line, increasing <br />
total containment to 70%. A dry cold front moved through the area last night, resulting in decreased <br />
temperatures and increased relative humidity. A rock slide was reported on the western side of the fire last <br />
night. <br />
<br />
Today Firefighters will scout the area of last night’s rock slide and extinguish embers that may have rolled into <br />
unburned fuels toward the west while taking extra precautions to watch for continued rock slide activity. The <br />
east and south edges of the fire are in patrol status, as firefighters watch for and extinguish hot spots near the <br />
established fireline.  Areas interior to firelines will continue to have hotspots and areas of smoking vegetation. <br />
If visibility allows for helicopter flights, firefighters will use water drops to cool areas as needed.  <br />
<br />
Weather for today: Continued cooling with a chance of rain showers and possible isolated thunderstorms in <br />
the afternoon. Light north winds.  Facebook at: https://www.facebook.com/newimt3/ and <br />

GLIDE, Ore. – Fire crews made headway bolstering the containment lines on the Chaos Fire, while keeping it <br />
from moving farther west or south.  Work will continue today on mopping up along containment lines, <br />
conducting direct attack where feasible, and indirect attack where appropriate based on weather, fuels, and <br />
topography. Firefighter and the public safety are always a priority during wildland fire fighting operations. <br />
<br />
Operations on the Jack Fire will focus on strengthening containment lines while working on additional indirect <br />
lines to keep the fire from moving west. The South Chilcoot Fire are now in patrol status, firefighters will <br />
continue to monitor the containment lines ensuring they remain secure. Throughout the fire zones, firefighters <br />
are working to secure and reinforce about 70 miles of primary, alternate and contingency line, while also <br />
suppressing fires that have crossed containment lines and engage any spot fires. <br />
<br />
Great Basin Team 2, a Type 1 Incident Management Team led by Tony DeMasters, has assumed command of <br />
the Rough Patch Complex and Jack Fire at 7 a.m. Sunday Aug. 16. Great Basin Team 2 would like to thank <br />
fire managers from NW13 for the hard work they have put into managing these fires. <br />
<br />
Fire activity continued to be subdued Saturday due to a temperature inversion holding the smoke near the <br />
ground, causing limited visibility and hampering flight operations. Weather conditions are forecasted to begin <br />
cooling with smoke starting to lift Sunday afternoon and clearing out by Wednesday.  <br />
<br />
Friday, the Umpqua and Willamette National Forests updated existing closure orders to encompass the <br />
Rough Patch, Jack, Archie Creek and Devil's Knob Fire Areas. This includes Canton Creek Campground, <br />
Musick Guard Station and Cover Campground. <br />
<br />
Roseburg District Bureau of Land Management has expanded its closure area to include the Scaredman <br />
Recreation Site. Francis Creek Road from the junction with Canton Creek Road north to the district boundary <br />
has been closed since Aug. 5.</span>

<br />
Yesterday: A frontal passage with strong wind gusts fueled fire activity and pushed the fire northeast toward <br />
Highway 410 and west toward Bumping River Road. On both corridors, fire crews made extensive progress <br />
with felling operations, clearing snags, trimming branches and removing hazard structures that could pose as <br />
a threat to firefighter or structure safety or increase fire activity. Suppression crews placed hoses and portable <br />
water tanks near structures, plumbing areas in advance of any fire activity. To date, 42 miles of contingency <br />
lines have been built by firefighters on the Schneider Fire, including dozer and fuel breaks. Scoopers and <br />
helicopters provided aerial support on the southern/western perimeter.<br />
Today: Cooler weather and higher humidity are expected today, which will provide more relief to ground <br />
crews. Residents and visitors to the area are encouraged to remain mindful of rapidly changing conditions. <br />
Structure planning and preparation will continue, along with the development of strategies for wildland-urban <br />
interface direct suppression measures. Crews are preparing for potential night burnout operations on the <br />
eastern flank, to prepare ahead of any fire perimeter spread. Air operations will continue if weather and <br />
conditions are favorable enough to support them, and the public is reminded to remain vigilant of overhead <br />
distractions when driving through the area.<br />
Evacuations: Bumping River Road and drainage remains at a LEVEL 3 evacuation. This means if you live in <br />
the area that you need to evacuate now. Hwy 410 from Eagle Rock north and west to Bumping River Road is <br />
currently in a LEVEL 2 Evacuation. This means if you live in the area you need to BE SET. Please check with <br />
Yakima County Office of Emergency Management on their official Facebook page <br />
https://www.facebook.com/YakimaCountyOEM for updates on evacuation information. Residents and visitors <br />
are encouraged to sign up for geo-specific emergency alerts through Yakima County: <br />
https://www.yakimacounty.us/2222/Alert-Yakima<br />
Closures: An extension to the current temporary Forest closure order for National Forest lands has been <br />
issued, and covers the northwest portion of the William O. Douglas Wilderness Area to Hwy 410, and north of <br />
Hwy 410 in the Little Naches drainage. The closure order and map are available at <br />
https://bit.ly/ForestClosureOrders (Naches Ranger District table).<br />
Smoke and Fire Restrictions Information: The Forest Service works closely with other federal and state <br />
partners to predict and mitigate smoke impacts on individuals and communities during wildfires. Visit <br />
https://wasmoke.blogspot.com/ for local air quality information. Campfire restrictions are in effect and <br />
prohibited throughout the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest. Contact local ranger district offices for more <br />
information: https://tinyurl.com/yby4oysq<br />
SAFETY: A Temporary Flight Restriction (TFR) is in place above the Schneider Springs Fire area. Wildfires <br />
are a No Drone Zone. Visit Know Before You Fly: http://knowbeforeyoufly.org</span>

Firefighters Focused on Thorough Mop Up of Poole Creek Fire<br />
<br />
CANYONVILLE, Ore.— Fire crews today are methodically cooling hot spots on the Poole Creek Fire using a <br />
grid system to make sure none are missed. This mop up will continue over the next few days as the ODF fire <br />
team begins planning to transition management of the Complex to a smaller organization toward the end of <br />
the week. Containment on fires in the Complex is 49% overall, with all 19 fires lined and most smaller ones in <br />
patrol status.<br />
<br />
Operations Section Chief Mike Carlson said, “Catching all these fires is very impressive. And I continue to be <br />
impressed by the thoroughness of crews doing the mop up.”<br />
<br />
As mop up continues on Poole Creek, planning for suppression repair is underway. This involves ensuring <br />
that water bars and other drainage diversions are installed on access roads, control lines and other cleared <br />
areas. A water bar is a diagonal channel across a road or fire line that diverts surface water into surrounding <br />
vegetation to prevent erosion. There, sediments settle out, keeping streams clear and protecting fish and <br />
other aquatic life.<br />
<br />
Firefighters have been following COVID-19 precautions in fire camp and out in the community, wearing <br />
masks, washing hands and maintaining social distance outside their immediate work group. Today, the <br />
medical unit is offering free COVID-19 vaccinations in fire camp to any firefighters as they demobilize. <br />
Vaccination is recommended but voluntary.</span>

Inchelium, WA – The Summit Trail Fire was started by lightning on July 12, and is burning on the Colville <br />
Reservation approximately 17 miles west of Inchelium. The Upper Lime Creek Fire, started by lightning on <br />
August 4, is also burning on the Colville Reservation approximately 6 miles north of Keller. It is now 65 <br />
percent contained, and remains at 376 acres. Mop-up operations and patrolling continue in that area. Both <br />
fires are being managed by Northwest Incident Management Team 10, with 411 personnel engaged in fighting <br />
the fires. <br />
<br />
The situation around the Summit Trail Fire is fluid, and additional updates will be issued throughout the day. <br />
Pushed by strong southwesterly winds during yesterday’s Red Flag Warning conditions, at least two large <br />
spot fires developed overnight to the northeast of the Summit Trail Fire, on Tungsten and Brush Mountains. <br />
As a result, the Colville Tribal Police have issued additional Level 2 (Get Set) and Level 3 (Go Now) <br />
evacuation orders. Fire crews are scouting the area, working to assess the extent of the new fire starts.<br />
<br />
 Today, fire crews and heavy equipment are actively engaging in structure protection. Currently, air support is <br />
engaged as well. Firefighters will reengage on the north and northeast flanks of the Summit Trail Fire and <br />
related spot fires after critical needs assessments are complete. Resources will be allocated where needed <br />
most. Hand crews and heavy equipment continue to build, connect and reinforce lines on the south, southeast <br />
and west flanks of the fire. Summit Trail <br />
<br />
Evacuations: • Level 3 (Red “Go” – Leave Immediately!): Residences along Spring Creek Road and Barnaby <br />
Creek Road. • Level 2 (Yellow -- “Get Set”): Residences along the Inchelium Highway from Inchelium to <br />
Highway 20. • Level 1 (Green – “Get Ready”): Residences from La Fleur south along Hall Creek Rd. to Hall <br />
Creek Flat (including Lynx Creek Rd.), Seyler Valley Rd. south to Bridge Creek Rd., and along Bridge Creek <br />
Rd. (including Mollenberg Lane) to Twin Lakes. The Twin Lakes area is under a Level 1 evacuation as well. <br />
Upper Lime Creek Evacuations: • Level 1 (Green – “Get Ready”) evacuation notices are in place from Empire <br />
Ck. to the Pines. <br />
Closures: The Colville Reservation, closed to the general public, has an Industrial Fire Precaution Level IV <br />
(General Shutdown), which closes all forest roads to the public. State and county improved roads (with a <br />
paved or gravel surface) remain open. For more information about the Colville Indian Tribes, visit <br />

Inchelium, WA – The Summit Trail Fire was started by lightning on July 12, and is burning on the Colville <br />
Reservation approximately 17 miles west of Inchelium. The Upper Lime Creek Fire, started by lightning on <br />
August 4, is also burning on the Colville Reservation approximately 6 miles north of Keller. It is now 65 <br />
percent contained, and remains at 376 acres. Mop-up operations and patrolling continue in that area. Both <br />
fires are being managed by Northwest Incident Management Team 10, with 411 personnel engaged in fighting <br />
the fires. <br />
<br />
The situation around the Summit Trail Fire is fluid, and additional updates will be issued throughout the day. <br />
Pushed by strong southwesterly winds during yesterday’s Red Flag Warning conditions, at least two large <br />
spot fires developed overnight to the northeast of the Summit Trail Fire, on Tungsten and Brush Mountains. <br />
As a result, the Colville Tribal Police have issued additional Level 2 (Get Set) and Level 3 (Go Now) <br />
evacuation orders. Fire crews are scouting the area, working to assess the extent of the new fire starts.<br />
<br />
 Today, fire crews and heavy equipment are actively engaging in structure protection. Currently, air support is <br />
engaged as well. Firefighters will reengage on the north and northeast flanks of the Summit Trail Fire and <br />
related spot fires after critical needs assessments are complete. Resources will be allocated where needed <br />
most. Hand crews and heavy equipment continue to build, connect and reinforce lines on the south, southeast <br />
and west flanks of the fire. Summit Trail <br />
<br />
Evacuations: • Level 3 (Red “Go” – Leave Immediately!): Residences along Spring Creek Road and Barnaby <br />
Creek Road. • Level 2 (Yellow -- “Get Set”): Residences along the Inchelium Highway from Inchelium to <br />
Highway 20. • Level 1 (Green – “Get Ready”): Residences from La Fleur south along Hall Creek Rd. to Hall <br />
Creek Flat (including Lynx Creek Rd.), Seyler Valley Rd. south to Bridge Creek Rd., and along Bridge Creek <br />
Rd. (including Mollenberg Lane) to Twin Lakes. The Twin Lakes area is under a Level 1 evacuation as well. <br />
Upper Lime Creek Evacuations: • Level 1 (Green – “Get Ready”) evacuation notices are in place from Empire <br />
Ck. to the Pines. <br />
Closures: The Colville Reservation, closed to the general public, has an Industrial Fire Precaution Level IV <br />
(General Shutdown), which closes all forest roads to the public. State and county improved roads (with a <br />
paved or gravel surface) remain open. For more information about the Colville Indian Tribes, visit <br />

A Community Open House for the Walker and Chickadee Fires will be today at 7 pm at the History Park <br />
Community Pool, 6 ½ N. Locust Way, Tonasket, WA.<br />
<br />
Walker Creek Fire: The Red Flag Warning issued for Sunday August 14 produced gusty southwest winds and <br />
increased the fire size by 6,000 acres. Those increases were in the southwest and northeast perimeters of the <br />
fire. The fire has not reached Beaver Canyon.   Around Lost Lake firefighters were successful in extinguishing <br />
multiple spot fires.  Clearing skies allowed aerial resources which included VLATs (Very Large Air Tankers), <br />
three heavy lift helicopters and water scooping planes (Super Scoopers) to make multiple drops to assist <br />
firefighters. Crews installed sprinklers and hose lays along the Bonaparte and Summer roads for structure <br />
protection.<br />
<br />
Today’s activities include continuing with structure protection, scouting a fireline location to bring the <br />
southwest edge of the fire to Highway 20, identifying roads, trails and natural features to construct fire line on <br />
the northeast perimeter of the fire and continued hot spotting. <br />
<br />
Chickadee Creek Fire:  Yesterday, gusty southwest winds pushed the fire northeast and increased the fire <br />
size by 800 acres. Today’s activities include scouting a fire line from the new fire area to roads, trails and <br />

The Whitmore Fire is located on the Colville Reservation south of Omak Lake and west of Nespelem, WA. <br />
The Incident Command Post at Nespelem Community Center is closed to all but essential personnel to help <br />
ensure the health and safety of community members and firefighters.<br />
<br />
A cold front moved through overnight, and today’s high temperatures are expected to be about 10 degrees <br />
cooler than Sunday.<br />
<br />
SIZE:  58,276 acres<br />
CONTAINMENT: 50%<br />
PERSONNEL: 317<br />
CAUSE: Lightning<br />
RESOURCES:<br />
Hand Crews: 5<br />
Engines: 24<br />
Dozers: 5<br />
Water Tenders: 17<br />
Helicopters: 1<br />
Fixed Wing: 1<br />
<br />
Operations<br />
Firefighters were successful in holding the fire within the existing footprint during the Red Flag conditions <br />
yesterday, although the hot, dry winds caused an increase in activity on other area fires. The Mount Whitmore <br />
Lookout survived the fire and is within an area of green, unburned fuels. Fire crews secured the Whitmore <br />
Lookout and began mop-up on smoldering fuels in the area. Yesterday, crews responded to a flare-up in a <br />
riparian area on the southeastern portion of the fire, quickly extinguishing the heat source. Firefighters <br />
continued their work systematically gridding along the eastern fire perimeter, mopping up and securing any <br />
residual heat sources.<br />
<br />
Today, firefighters will focus their patrol and mop-up work on the northern and eastern fire perimeter. Fire <br />
crews are mapping fire suppression lines for future repair work to protect natural resources and minimize the <br />
potential for erosion. Firefighters will continue priority repair work on dozer lines inside the fire perimeter <br />
today. Fire containment has progressed to the point that a night shift is no longer necessary on the fire. As <br />
activity on the Whitmore Fire winds down, resources no longer needed for fire suppression are being released <br />
to assist on other area fires.<br />
<br />
Evacuations<br />
Level 2 evacuations remain in place for the Columbia River Road corridor, Kartar Valley, Colville Agency, the <br />
community of Nespelem, and the SR155 corridor from Colville Agency north up to the Mission. Call Tribal <br />
Police at (509) 634-2472 with all evacuation questions.<br />
<br />
Traffic and Road Closures<br />
Coyote Creek Road remains closed.</span>

<br />
Current Status: The fire is in full mop-op mode, and crews are continuing to monitor the perimeter for hot <br />
spots, completing mop-op where those spots presented a threat to control lines. Fire behavior is minimal and <br />
smoldering, but no active fire behavior has been observed. There is no anticipated change in the fire spread. <br />
Terrain within the burned area is steep and largely inaccessible, and smokejumpers assisted suppression <br />
efforts earlier in the week. Ground crews remain onsite. The fire is being managed jointly with the Schneider <br />
Springs Fire on the Naches Ranger District to the southwest, and some resources that were on the Windy <br />
Pass Fire have now been reassigned to assist suppression efforts in that area.<br />
<br />
Weather: High temperatures and low RH value are currently in the forecast through the day. A cold front <br />
passing through this morning will bring high wind gusts. An Excessive Heat Warning is in effect for today <br />
through 8:00 p.m. Closures:  The Forest Service has issued Closure Order 06-17-03-21-15 for the Taneum <br />
and Manastash drainages including Forest Roads FSR 3100, 3104, 3111, 3120, 3300, 3330, 3350, 3352, <br />
4100, 4110, and 4510. For further details on roads, trails, and campgrounds closed, please visit <br />
