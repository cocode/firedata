<br />
Crews will continue to mop-up and work on suppression repair in all divisions today. The fire remains at 85% <br />
containment and that number is expected to increase in the days ahead. The Type 2 Incident Command <br />
Team, Northwest 6 will be transitioning the fire to a local Type 3 Team tomorrow, August 25 at 7:00 am.<br />
<br />
Suppression efforts on the Black Butte fire were successful due to a lot of hard work from many partners and <br />
firefighters. The fire began after a lightning strike and quickly spread due to steep terrain, extremely dry fuels, <br />
and weather. Over time, the fire interacted with over 90 fuels treatments (prescribed burns, pile burns, slash <br />
clean up and thinning projects) slowing its forward progress. With the advantage of the pre-existing fuel <br />
treatments and moderate wind, firefighters were able to initiate offensive strategies to increase containment.<br />
<br />
Fire danger continues to be extreme on the Malheur National Forest and surrounding areas and fire <br />
restrictions are in place. Please remember to use caution while visiting public lands. Propane stoves and <br />
lanterns are permitted, but no open flames or campfires are allowed.<br />
<br />
Recreation Sites within the closure boundary: North Fork Malheur River Trailheads both north and south, <br />
North Fork Malheur Campground, Crane Crossing Trailheads both east and west, Short Creek Guard Station, <br />
Elk Creek Campground, Sunshine Flat Trailhead and Trail, Horseshoe Trailhead and Trail, Sheep Creek Trail <br />
and Trailhead, Little Crane Campground.<br />
<br />
Currently the Trout Farm and Crescent Campgrounds are still open to the public.<br />

<br />
Slightly drier, yet normal weather conditions yesterday allowed firefighters assigned to the Bull Complex to <br />
narrow the gap between the main fire and the containment lines along the 4696 Road, using small fires set by <br />
aviation resources to bring the main fire closer to constructed containment lines. <br />
<br />
Current actions are designed to create a starting point for crews to engage the fire’s edge from safer locations <br />
to work. The fire actively burned on all sides, mainly through surface-level vegetation, and made short uphill <br />
runs in the timber on the northeast corner in Ogre Creek drainage Tuesday. Firefighters used and will <br />
continue using helicopters to keep the fire’s growth in check by dropping water on areas gaining intensity. <br />
<br />
Three more hand crews are expected to arrive today and will engage in firefighting efforts upon arrival. Heavy <br />
equipment on site will continue removing hazardous amounts of vegetation to build and strengthen existing <br />
containment lines away from the main fire (indirect actions). Indirect actions are actions taken at a distance <br />
away from the main fire.  Indirect containment lines allow firefighters to engage the fire more safely, using <br />
natural features, such as ridges or waterways, and manmade clearings, such as roads.  As the fire grows <br />
towards these containment lines, firefighters may ignite vegetation (known as a burn out) along the <br />
containment lines that will burn into the main fire but with less intensity. <br />
<br />
Weather conditions are expected to moderate again today through Friday and to bring cooler temperatures <br />
and higher humidity. Another warming and drying trend is forecast for the weekend.  Increased smoke is <br />
expected to be visible today and residents are likely to see morning smoke inversions daily.  For additional <br />
information on air quality and related health concerns, visit https://fire.airnow.gov/ and <br />
https://oregonsmoke.blogspot.com/. <br />
<br />
Closures:  For the safety of wildland firefighters and the public, the National Forests have enacted area <br />
closures that prevent the public from being upon National Forest System lands in the vicinity of the Bull <br />
Complex where uncontrolled fire and fire suppression activities are occurring. All National Forest System <br />
lands that are south and west of Forest Road 46, and east of the Riverside Fire perimeter. The entire length of <br />
National Forest Road 46 is closed. The lands within the 2020 Lionshead and Beachie Fire areas are also <br />
closed.  See the closure orders and maps at https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/closures/7773/. Contractors <br />
approved by the Forest Service are allowed through the closure order, as are vendors and others working on <br />
recovery efforts related to the 2020 area fires.  Breitenbush Hot Springs Resort is open; however, <br />
reservations are required to pass through a roadblock on NFR 46.</span>

<br />
Kettle Falls, WA –Taking advantage of another day of reduced fire behavior, firefighters continued holding the <br />
Bulldog Mountain and Mack Mountain fires within their current perimeters yesterday. Slightly higher <br />
temperatures and lower humidity was enough to dry out fuels in areas exposed to sun, causing them to burn <br />
at low intensity and put up some smoke.<br />
<br />
On both fires, the construction of direct containment line along the fire’s edge is not possible due to the steep <br />
and inaccessible terrain. Firefighters are completing and reinforcing indirect containment lines where terrain <br />
and access permit, usually at some distance from the fire’s edge. These lines utilize existing roads and some <br />
newly constructed hand and dozer line, which will surround both fires when completed.<br />
<br />
Work is nearly complete to the south of Mack Mountain Fire to connect the last link of a contingency line from <br />
Albion Hill to Deadman Creek. Mastication of large woody materials along the 320 Road northeast of the fire <br />
is also nearly complete.<br />
<br />
Warmer temperatures and slightly increased winds are predicted for the next several days. There is a 50% <br />
chance of rain by Thursday night into Friday morning, with rainfall amounts predicted to range from .10 to .20 <br />
inches.<br />
<br />
Citizens should remain vigilant and are strongly encouraged to sign up for alerts at  Ferry County Alerts.  <br />
Motorists traveling on Boulder Hwy and SR395 should watch for heavy equipment and firefighters turning off <br />
and onto the roadway. Firefighter and public safety is our number one priority. <br />
<br />
Smoke: Current weather conditions will moderate smoke impacts throughout the area today.<br />
<br />
Closures: An area closure is in effect on Colville National Forest lands in the vicinity of the Bulldog Mountain <br />
Fire. For more information on area and road closures on the Colville National Forest, please visit: <br />
https://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fseprd938379.pdf<br />
<br />
Citizens are asked to stay clear of the fire area and comply with area closures. <br />
<br />
While current weather conditions provide respite from the extreme fire potential present in northeast <br />
Washington, the forest can quickly dry out again in the many weeks of fire season ahead. Please continue to <br />
do all you can to prevent wildfires.<br />
<br />
The Incident Command Post has been relocated to Inchelium as Team 7 also assumes command of the <br />
Summit Trail Fire. A spike camp will remain in place to support the Bulldog Mountain and Mack Mountain <br />
Fires.</span>

Cedar Creek Fire: The fire is 55,187 acres and is 80% contained. The entire fire area will be on patrol status <br />
today. Helicopter water drops will be used to cool areas near the fire’s edge if needed to assist ground crews with <br />
mopping up fuel. All evacuation level 1 (Advisory) areas associated with the Cedar Creek Fire have been <br />
removed.<br />
<br />
Cub Creek 2 Fire: The Cub Creek 2 Fire is 70,186 acres and 70% contained. Crews will continue removing hose, <br />
pumps, and other equipment from the fire area for repair and reconditioning for use on future fires. Crews will <br />
continue patrolling and mopping up hot areas of burning fuel to secure the fire’s edge. Rehabilitation of fire lines <br />
are underway.<br />
<br />
Delancy Fire: The Delancy Fire is being monitored and remains at 223 acres and 95% containment.<br />
<br />
Northwest Interagency Incident Management Team 9 (NWIIMT9) assumes command of Cedar Creek, Cub Creek <br />
2, Delancy, and Muckamuck fires today. They will build on the success of California Interagency Incident <br />
Management Team 2 (CIIMT2) and the previous teams, and it is committed to maintaining the positive <br />
relationships that exist with the local communities.<br />
<br />
Fire Weather: Slightly warmer temperatures and lighter slope and valley upslope winds will dominate during the <br />
day, reversing to usual down-Methow and Chewuch valley winds and gusts in the evening. A pre-frontal warming <br />
trend with lower humidities will continue to dry fuels today before an approaching cold front Wednesday with <br />
southwesterly flow and cooler temperatures.</span>

<br />
Current Situation:<br />
<br />
Areas of both fires continue to hold significant heat, even in areas that have been burning for three weeks.<br />
Crews continue to staff night operations, patrolling and monitoring overnight fire activity on both fires.<br />
As fire activity lessens and firefighting activity slows, resources can begin to assess damage to private <br />
property.<br />
The Rocky Mountain Incident Management Blue Team will transition with the Type 2 Pacific Northwest Team <br />
12, which will assume command of both fires tomorrow, Thursday, August 26.<br />
Operational Plan for Today:<br />
<br />
Line construction is complete on the south, east, and west sides of the Chickadee Creek Fire, using direct line <br />
wherever possible.<br />
Firefighters will continue to lay hose and mop up heat sources near the fire perimeter.<br />
Indirect lines are nearing completion in Chickadee Creek and Sarsapkin Creek in preparation for future <br />
burnout operations in those areas.<br />
Helicopters will work areas of heat, especially along the east end of the fire when flareups occur.<br />
Fire conditions and weather:<br />
<br />
Toda's weather will be warmer and dryer than it has been for the past week. Temperatures will range from 65 <br />
to 75 degrees, with relatively humidity dropping to around 15 to 25 percent. Skies will be sunny with light <br />
winds. <br />
Fuels are gradually drying since the rain that was received on both fires over last weekend. Fire behavior is <br />
expected to increase with lower relative humidity and higher temperatures, with moderate fire behavior <br />
expected today.<br />

Cedar Creek Fire: The fire is 55,187 acres and is 80% contained. The entire fire area will be on patrol status <br />
today. Helicopter water drops will be used to cool areas near the fire’s edge if needed to assist ground crews with <br />
mopping up fuel. All evacuation level 1 (Advisory) areas associated with the Cedar Creek Fire have been <br />
removed.<br />
<br />
Cub Creek 2 Fire: The Cub Creek 2 Fire is 70,186 acres and 70% contained. Crews will continue removing hose, <br />
pumps, and other equipment from the fire area for repair and reconditioning for use on future fires. Crews will <br />
continue patrolling and mopping up hot areas of burning fuel to secure the fire’s edge. Rehabilitation of fire lines <br />
are underway.<br />
<br />
Delancy Fire: The Delancy Fire is being monitored and remains at 223 acres and 95% containment.<br />
<br />
Northwest Interagency Incident Management Team 9 (NWIIMT9) assumes command of Cedar Creek, Cub Creek <br />
2, Delancy, and Muckamuck fires today. They will build on the success of California Interagency Incident <br />
Management Team 2 (CIIMT2) and the previous teams, and it is committed to maintaining the positive <br />
relationships that exist with the local communities.<br />
<br />
Fire Weather: Slightly warmer temperatures and lighter slope and valley upslope winds will dominate during the <br />
day, reversing to usual down-Methow and Chewuch valley winds and gusts in the evening. A pre-frontal warming <br />
trend with lower humidities will continue to dry fuels today before an approaching cold front Wednesday with <br />
southwesterly flow and cooler temperatures.</span>

<br />
The Devil's Knob Complex is a group of lightning-caused fires on the Tiller Ranger District of the Umpqua <br />
National Forest and private lands protected by Douglas Forest Protective Association. The complex is being <br />
managed by the Florida Red Incident Management Team (Rick Dolan) in cooperation with local agencies and <br />
stakeholders to protect private property and residences, commercial values and tribal lands and resources. <br />
<br />
Smith Fire – 11,157 acres – Firefighters are taking advantage of moderated fire behavior and utilizing dozers <br />
to build direct line along the northwest edge of the fire to reduce the future footprint of the fire. Crews continue <br />
to mop up previous firing operations and prep roads for future use as firelines throughout the perimeter. <br />
<br />
In Ash Valley, two task forces of engines from Douglas and Linn counties through the Office of Oregon State <br />
Fire Marshall, as well as resources from Douglas Forest Protective Association are in place and working to <br />
protect structures and limit the fire’s impact in that area. <br />
<br />
Big Hamlin Fire – 12,470 acres – Firefighters continue with strategic firing operations as weather conditions <br />
allow along the southern perimeter of the fire. Crews continue to mop up from previous firing operations <br />
throughout the western edge and work to identify and construct indirect holding features along the eastern <br />
flank.  <br />
<br />
Dismal Creek, Little Applegate, Mule Creek, Section 30 (Railroad), Wild Cat fires – 1,489 total acres– <br />
Contained and in patrol status. <br />
<br />
Weather: Mostly sunny conditions with temperatures in the mid-70 to mid-80-degree range are forecast <br />
throughout the area. Lower humidities and clear skies could contribute to an increase in fire behavior but <br />
overlying smoky conditions should prevail and moderate the fire’s spread. Winds will be light and generally <br />
terrain driven with a prevailing northwestern flow.  <br />
<br />
Air Quality: Smoke levels can change rapidly depending on weather. Check current conditions on the Oregon <br />

Temporary Flight Restrictions: For the safety of the firefighters and aircraft fighting the Devil’s Knob Complex, <br />
a temporary flightrestriction remains over portions of the fire area. Wildfires are a “No Drone Zone.” <br />
<br />
Evacuations and Closures: Visit the Douglas County Sheriff Office’s interactive evacuation map at <br />
www.dcso.com/evacuations. Residents can opt in to receive emergency alerts by registering at <br />

<br />
The Forest Service has implemented an Emergency Fire Closure restricting public access to most of the <br />
Steamboat, North Umpqua, and South Umpqua drainages because of high fire danger and the safety of <br />
firefighting resources in the area. To view the Closure in its entirety, visit this link. Conditions remain very dry. <br />
Any spark has a very high probability of starting a new fire, so the public is reminded to be extremely careful <br />
while enjoying the out-of-doors. “One Less Spark, One Less Wildfire.”</span>

Announcements:  A virtual public meeting for the Ford Corkscrew Fire will take place tonight, Wednesday, August <br />
25, 2021 at 7pm PDT via the Northwest Washington Fire Information Facebook page. Please note, you do not <br />
need to have a Facebook account to attend a live video.  <br />
<br />
Active fire behavior and smoke are expected in pockets of unburned fuels, until fire reaches containment lines. <br />
Firefighters have successfully conducted felling operations of hazard trees along Highway 231, between Happy <br />
Hill Road and Ford yesterday. Crews will continue conducting infrared structure assessments and developing <br />
reports for properties impacted by the Ford Corkscrew Fire. Red and white striped flagging mays still be visible in <br />
driveways to indicate a completed infrared assessment for that property. Evacuations are still in place. Residents <br />
should monitor https://www.facebook.com/stevenscountyem for the latest information. <br />
<br />
Overview: The Ford Corkscrew Fire showed moderate fire behavior yesterday with torching and spotting during <br />
firing operations. The region will experience a continued warming and drying trend, which will support active fire <br />
spread, including torching and spotting, in any uncontained and pockets of burned fuels.  <br />
<br />
Fire Update: Crews have successfully constructed 45 miles of hand and dozer line on the Ford Corkscrew Fire <br />
with the western edge (Division Alpha) now contained. Yesterday, resources continued to construct direct and <br />
indirect containment line and conduct point protection near values at risk. Firing operations occurred in some <br />
areas to remove unburned fuel between the fire edge and constructed control lines. Crews also continued mop <br />
up activities, patrolled containment lines and worked to secure interior unburned islands. <br />
<br />
Firing operations will take place where necessary to further secure the perimeter. Resources in all divisions will <br />
monitor and mop up within completed lines, provide point protection where needed and continue to identify <br />
suppression repair needs. Crews will also secure unburned islands around structures, including in Rail Canyon. <br />
<br />
The Southwest Area Incident Management Team 5 continues working closely with local partners and <br />
stakeholders to continue evaluating evacuation levels across the fire area. Residents are encouraged to stay out <br />
of evacuated areas for their own safety and the safety of the firefighters.  <br />
<br />
For structure status information, please email your name, contact information, and address of the property you <br />
are inquiring about to 2021.fordcorkscrew@firenet.gov or call 509-508-3311 between the hours of 8am and 8pm <br />
PDT. An agency representative from the Stevens County Fire District 1 will contact you as soon as possible. <br />
<br />
Closures/Restrictions: Road closures remain in place and a reduced, temporary flight restriction (TFR) remains in <br />
effect around the fire area. Residents and visitors are also encouraged to maintain a safe distance from working <br />
aircraft conducting water filling operations on local water ways and lakes, including Loon and Long lakes.  <br />
<br />
Ways you can help: We greatly appreciate the support and generosity of the community! Our team’s focus is on <br />
the mission of fire suppression while keeping firefighter and public safety our number one priority. Our wildland <br />
fire crews and staff at Incident Command are well equipped and cared for. While we will not be accepting <br />
donations, residents are encouraged to support firefighter efforts and the local community in other ways such <br />
posting thank you or consider financial contributions to a voluntary organization of your choice (i.e., American <br />
Red Cross, local fire department, etc.).</span>

The Patton Meadow fire is currently 8,947 acres and 70% contained<br />
<br />
Lakeview, OR- Containment on the Patton Meadow Fire is now at 70%. Crews are gridding the fire’s perimeter <br />
and increasing the rind by digging out and applying water to hot spots. The majority of containment efforts are <br />
along the north perimeter of the fire along Cottonwood Road. Several additional crews have been assigned to <br />
accelerate the mop up activities in this area. Fallers are working ahead of crews to remove hazard trees for the <br />
safety of hand crews performing mop up operations.<br />
<br />
Along the west, south, and east perimeters, mop up efforts continue further into the black to meet containment <br />
objectives. Crews continue to grid the green to locate any spot fires outside the fire perimeter. In areas where <br />
containment is complete, efforts are ramping up to remove hose lays and repair areas impacted by fire <br />
containment efforts. Unneeded equipment will be hauled off the fire line. As the firefighting effort winds down, <br />
more crews will be demobilizing and heading home or onto other fire assignments.<br />
<br />
The National Guard continues assisting with traffic control for the safety of firefighters and the public. We thank <br />
them for their contributions throughout this firefighting effort.<br />
<br />
Today’s forecast calls for a mid-level trough moving into the region that will increase cloud cover, cooling high <br />
temperatures slightly and keeping afternoon humidity around 15-20%. Southwest winds around 10mph in the <br />
morning will increase to 15mph with gusts of 20-25mph in the afternoon.</span>

<br />
Current Situation: Green Ridge Fire: The Green Ridge Fire remains 35% contained and is 39,490 acres after 19 <br />
acres of growth on Monday. Fire activity was minimal again due on Tuesday despite sunny skies and lower <br />
relative humidity across the fire area. Crews continued mopping up sections of uncontrolled line in divisions M <br />
and K. Crews completed the removal of equipment and miles of hose from contained portions of line on the north <br />
and west sides of the fire so this equipment can be cleaned and redistributed to other incidents across the west.<br />
<br />
On Wednesday, crews will continue the patrol and mop up work that has been ongoing in divisions M and K on <br />
the north and west sides of the fire. The drying trend that started earlier this week will continue today and is <br />
expected to result in a slight increase in fire behavior and some smoke production. Three fire suppression <br />
modules will be monitoring fire activity and engaging any new fires or spots that occur in divisions P and S on the <br />
south side of the fire.<br />
<br />
Current Situation: Lick Creek Fire: The Lick Creek fire remains 80,421 acres and 97% contained. Firefighters will <br />
continue patrolling containment lines and addressing hot spots along those lines when needed. Smoke may be <br />
visible in the coming days as winds may cause unburned fuels inside the fire’s perimeter to burn.<br />
<br />
At 6:00 a.m. on August 26, Rocky Mountain Team Black will transition command of the Green Ridge and Lick <br />
Creek Fires to Northwest Team 8, another Type 2 Incident Management Team. “Team Black greatly appreciated <br />
the cooperation from the local agencies and the warm welcome we received from the community during our time <br />
on the Green Ridge and Lick Creek Fires,” said Team Black Incident Commander Troy Hagan.<br />
<br />
Weather & Smoke Information: Increased cloud cover is expected over the fires Wednesday afternoon, which will <br />
keep temperatures cooler and relative humidity higher. Winds will blow out of the west-northwest at 5-8 mph with <br />
gusts up to 16 mph in the afternoon. Temperatures will be in the high 60s above 5500’ and low to mid 70s in the <br />
valleys. Cloud cover is expected to increase this evening leading to higher relative humidity and reduced fire <br />
behavior in the coming days. Smoke information is available on Washington Smoke Blog at: <br />
https://wasmoke.blogspot.com/<br />
<br />
 <br />
Forest Closures: Closures are in place on the Umatilla National Forest. The forest closure for some areas on the <br />
Umatilla NF have been amended. The amended order reopened most Umatilla NF lands in Oregon. The order <br />
also closed all lands on the Walla Walla Ranger District in Washington; forest lands in Washington on the <br />
Pomeroy Ranger District remain closed to entry. The closure order is available at https://go.usa.gov/xFyhn.<br />
<br />
Evacuations: Evacuations in Garfield and Columbia Counties were amended on Tuesday, August 24. The Level 3 <br />
evacuation area north of the Green Ridge Fire has been changed to a Level 2 evacuation. This area includes <br />
Clearwater Tower, Stentz Springs, and Rose Springs. With these changes, Garfield County and Columbia <br />
County currently have Level 1 and 2 evacuations in place. The Grouse Flats area is currently under a Level 1 <br />
evacuation in Garfield County, Asotin County, and Wallowa County, Oregon. An interactive fire map that shows <br />
evacuations and other important information is available at https://arcg.is/0mrCe1.</span>

Overall Objective: The Rough Patch Complex and Jack Fire are being managed under a full suppression <br />
strategy using<br />
containment and confinement tactics to minimize fire spread to prevent loss of valuable resources. Leaders’ <br />
intent is<br />
to not allow the fire to progress to the west and to protect private structures throughout the fire area by using <br />
the<br />
PACE model – Primary, Alternate, Contingency and Emergency control Lines and to keep the fires as small as <br />
possible<br />
while working toward full containment.<br />
The Devil’s Knob Complex is now under the management of the Southern Area Red Team – transfer of <br />
command from<br />
Great Basin Team 2 took place this morning at 6:00a.m.<br />
Closures: Copies of all closures and maps can be found at https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/closures/7758/.<br />
• UPDATE to BLM Roseburg District fire closure. The Francis Creek Road area and Scaredman Campground <br />
are<br />
again under a closure order due to potential fire activity, and to keep the area clear for firefighting operations.<br />
• The Umpqua and Willamette National Forests have area closure orders to encompass the Rough Patch, <br />
Jack,<br />
Archie Creek, and Devil's Knob Fire Areas. The closure includes Canton Creek Campground, Musick Guard <br />
Station,<br />
and Cover Campground.<br />
• Highway 138 between Roseburg and Diamond Lake and Crater Lake remains open. Slow down and be alert <br />
while<br />
passing through the fire area.<br />
Chaos and Little Bend Fires: Securing the west side of the Chaos is progressing well – burnout operations are<br />
complete on this flank of the fire and firefighters are focused on holding the fire in place to prevent spread to <br />
the<br />
west. The primary containment lines of these fires lay on the west and northwest flanks. Crews are working to <br />
the<br />
north from Canton Point through Shane Saddle and onto Bohemia Mountain to construct fire line to secure <br />
the Chaos<br />
fire from moving to the northwest. Additional work is being done on the southeast side of the Chaos fire to <br />
prevent<br />
the fire from moving south then to the west. On the Little Bend Fire, the west mid-section of the fire is <br />
contained and<br />
holding well 0 containment lines are complete between the Chaos and the Little Bend Fire.<br />
Jack and Buckhead Fires: The Jack Fire has containment lines that are holding on the west, north, and east <br />
flanks of<br />
the fires and these lines account for a large amount of containment of the fire. The Buckhead fire has burned <br />
into the<br />
Jack fire to the north - fire crews are patrolling these flanks and taking action to hold the lines as necessary. <br />
The<br />
southwest and south flanks of the fire are seeing moderate fire behavior – tactics on these flanks include <br />
direct dozer<br />
line, the construction of primary and alternate contingency lines using the road system, building and <br />
reinforcing<br />
contingency lines and conducting burnout operations as opportunities arise.<br />
Near Minky Fire: This fire lays south of the Jack and Buckhead Fires. The east flank of the fire has been <br />
contained.<br />
The nearby Smith Fire that is part of the Devil’s Knob Complex is actively growing to the northeast into Ash <br />
Valley.<br />
Because of this, additional firefighting resources have been moved into Ash Valley to assist in containing the <br />
Smith<br />
Fire while looking for opportunities to construct containment lines for both the Smith and Near Minky Fires. <br />
This area<br />
is the focus area and priority for today’s firefighting operations. The Near Minky Fire is at 0% containment.<br />
Weather: Winds over all the fires are predominately out of the northwest. As smoke clears, fire activity is <br />
expected to<br />
increase. Gust up to 15 mph can further promote fire spread. Afternoon relative humidity is expected to be in <br />
the<br />
mid- 20s to the upper 30s which will also promote</span>

Current Situation: Green Ridge Fire: The Green Ridge Fire remains 35% contained and is 39,490 acres after 19 <br />
acres of growth on Monday. Fire activity was minimal again due on Tuesday despite sunny skies and lower <br />
relative humidity across the fire area. Crews continued mopping up sections of uncontrolled line in divisions M <br />
and K. Crews completed the removal of equipment and miles of hose from contained portions of line on the north <br />
and west sides of the fire so this equipment can be cleaned and redistributed to other incidents across the west.<br />
<br />
<br />
On Wednesday, crews will continue the patrol and mop up work that has been ongoing in divisions M and K on <br />
the north and west sides of the fire. The drying trend that started earlier this week will continue today and is <br />
expected to result in a slight increase in fire behavior and some smoke production. Three fire suppression <br />
modules will be monitoring fire activity and engaging any new fires or spots that occur in divisions P and S on the <br />
south side of the fire.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Current Situation: Lick Creek Fire: The Lick Creek fire remains 80,421 acres and 97% contained. Firefighters will <br />
continue patrolling containment lines and addressing hot spots along those lines when needed. Smoke may be <br />
visible in the coming days as winds may cause unburned fuels inside the fire’s perimeter to burn.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
At 6:00 a.m. on August 26, Rocky Mountain Team Black will transition command of the Green Ridge and Lick <br />
Creek Fires to Northwest Team 8, another Type 2 Incident Management Team. “Team Black greatly appreciated <br />
the cooperation from the local agencies and the warm welcome we received from the community during our time <br />
on the Green Ridge and Lick Creek Fires,” said Team Black Incident Commander Troy Hagan.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Weather & Smoke Information: Increased cloud cover is expected over the fires Wednesday afternoon, which will <br />
keep temperatures cooler and relative humidity higher. Winds will blow out of the west-northwest at 5-8 mph with <br />
gusts up to 16 mph in the afternoon. Temperatures will be in the high 60s above 5500’ and low to mid 70s in the <br />
valleys. Cloud cover is expected to increase this evening leading to higher relative humidity and reduced fire <br />
behavior in the coming days. Smoke information is available on Washington Smoke Blog at: <br />
https://wasmoke.blogspot.com/<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Forest Closures: Closures are in place on the Umatilla National Forest. The forest closure for some areas on the <br />
Umatilla NF have been amended. The amended order reopened most Umatilla NF lands in Oregon. The order <br />
also closed all lands on the Walla Walla Ranger District in Washington; forest lands in Washington on the <br />
Pomeroy Ranger District remain closed to entry. The closure order is available at https://go.usa.gov/xFyhn.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Evacuations: Evacuations in Garfield and Columbia Counties were amended on Tuesday, August 24. The Level 3 <br />
evacuation area north of the Green Ridge Fire has been changed to a Level 2 evacuation. This area includes <br />
Clearwater Tower, Stentz Springs, and Rose Springs. With these changes, Garfield County and Columbia <br />
County currently have Level 1 and 2 evacuations in place. The Grouse Flats area is currently under a Level 1 <br />
evacuation in Garfield County, Asotin County, and Wallowa County, Oregon. An interactive fire map that shows <br />
evacuations and other important information is available at https://arcg.is/0mrCe1.mrCe1.</span>

Kettle Falls, WA –Taking advantage of another day of reduced fire behavior, firefighters continued holding the <br />
Bulldog Mountain and Mack Mountain fires within their current perimeters yesterday. Slightly higher <br />
temperatures and lower humidity was enough to dry out fuels in areas exposed to sun, causing them to burn <br />
at low intensity and put up some smoke.<br />
<br />
On both fires, the construction of direct containment line along the fire’s edge is not possible due to the steep <br />
and inaccessible terrain. Firefighters are completing and reinforcing indirect containment lines where terrain <br />
and access permit, usually at some distance from the fire’s edge. These lines utilize existing roads and some <br />
newly constructed hand and dozer line, which will surround both fires when completed.<br />
<br />
Work is nearly complete to the south of Mack Mountain Fire to connect the last link of a contingency line from <br />
Albion Hill to Deadman Creek. Mastication of large woody materials along the 320 Road northeast of the fire <br />
is also nearly complete.<br />
<br />
Warmer temperatures and slightly increased winds are predicted for the next several days. There is a 50% <br />
chance of rain by Thursday night into Friday morning, with rainfall amounts predicted to range from .10 to .20 <br />
inches.<br />
<br />
Citizens should remain vigilant and are strongly encouraged to sign up for alerts at  Ferry County Alerts.  <br />
Motorists traveling on Boulder Hwy and SR395 should watch for heavy equipment and firefighters turning off <br />
and onto the roadway. Firefighter and public safety is our number one priority. <br />
<br />
Smoke: Current weather conditions will moderate smoke impacts throughout the area today.<br />
<br />
Closures: An area closure is in effect on Colville National Forest lands in the vicinity of the Bulldog Mountain <br />
Fire. For more information on area and road closures on the Colville National Forest, please visit: <br />
https://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fseprd938379.pdf<br />
<br />
Citizens are asked to stay clear of the fire area and comply with area closures. <br />
<br />
While current weather conditions provide respite from the extreme fire potential present in northeast <br />
Washington, the forest can quickly dry out again in the many weeks of fire season ahead. Please continue to <br />
do all you can to prevent wildfires.<br />
<br />
The Incident Command Post has been relocated to Inchelium as Team 7 also assumes command of the <br />
Summit Trail Fire. A spike camp will remain in place to support the Bulldog Mountain and Mack Mountain <br />
Fires.</span>

Resources across the Middle Fork Complex shared a moment of silence Tuesday morning in memory of fallen <br />
firefighter Frumencio Ruiz Carapia. <br />
<br />
“The wildland firefighting community and our partners mourn this loss,” said Incident Commander Brian Gales of <br />
Northwest 13 Incident Management Team. “Our thoughts and prayers are with his family.” <br />
<br />
Ruiz Carapia died Monday afternoon after being struck by a falling tree while working along the eastern edge of <br />
the Gales Fire, according to the Lane County Sheriff’s Office. <br />
 <br />
A swing shift was added yesterday to take advantage of cooler temperatures and higher humidities for strategic <br />
ignitions along the northern edge of the Gales-Ninemile Fire. Warmer daytime temperatures and lower humidity <br />
stimulated interior burning in the Tiller, Black and Fall Creek areas Tuesday, which is expected to continue today. <br />
<br />
Safety: Archery deer and elk season begin Saturday, Aug. 28. A large part of McKenzie Unit 19 lies within fire <br />
closure areas and will not be open to hunters. If hunting near a fire closure perimeter, be alert to the potential for <br />
firefighters on foot in the area. Report spot fires by calling 911. <br />
<br />
Closures: There are numerous forest closures across the Cascades region and the Pacific Northwest. An <br />
interactive map showing all closures can be found at tinyurl.com/4j3fxy8y.  <br />
<br />
The Middle Fork Complex Fire Closure Area begins at the Forest Service Road 18 and the Forest Boundary, it <br />
then goes north along the Forest Boundary. Then follows the northern edge of T 18 S east, crossing into the <br />
McKenzie River Ranger District in Section 6, until intersecting with FS Road 19 in T 18 S, R 05 E, Section 4. <br />
Then it follows FS Road 19 south and then west until the intersection of FS Road 19 with FS Road 1910. Then <br />
follows FS Road1910 north until the intersection of FS Road 1910 and FS Road 1912. It then follows FS Road <br />
1912 north until the intersection of FS Road 1912 and FS Road 1802. Then follows FS Road 1802 northwest <br />
then west to the Forest Boundary. Then follows the Forest Boundary north to FS Road 18. FS Rd 2618, from its <br />
junction with the Forest Boundary to McKenzie Highway 126, which is also closed.</span>

<br />
Warm weather and light winds will amplify the drying trend through the week. Firefighters are focused on the <br />
north flank of the fire, where a matrix of unburned green fuels next to smoldering fuels increases the <br />
possibility of flying embers and tree torching. Minimal growth in the north is expected, and additional <br />
containment was achieved Monday.   <br />
<br />
The Siniahekin Road, North Fork Salmon Creek Road, Mineral Hill Road and the West Fork Road all remain <br />
closed outside of Conconully city limits.<br />
<br />
Command of Muckamuck, Cedar Creek, Cub Creek and Delancy fires will transfer from California Interagency <br />
Incident Management Team 2 (CIIMT2) to Northwest Interagency Incident Management Team 9 (NWIIMT9) <br />
on Wednesday, August 25, at 7a.m. NWIIMT9 will shadow CIIMT2 Tuesday, will build upon the work done by <br />
the previous teams and is committed to maintaining the positive relationships that exist with the local <br />
communities.<br />
<br />
Weather: Slope and valley winds, sun and low humidity will continue to dry lighter fuels and drought-stressed <br />
vegetation. Nighttime temperatures will drop into the 30s and 40s.  <br />
<br />
Evacuations:<br />
·       Level Three: Salmon Meadows-Kerr<br />
·       Level Two: Mineral Hill, West Fork-Conconully, and the area immediately surrounding the town limits of <br />
Conconully<br />
·       Level One: The area within the town limits of Conconully<br />

<br />
Overall Objective: The Rough Patch Complex and Jack Fire are being managed under a full suppression <br />
strategy using<br />
containment and confinement tactics to minimize fire spread to prevent loss of valuable resources. Leaders’ <br />
intent is<br />
to not allow the fire to progress to the west and to protect private structures throughout the fire area by using <br />
the<br />
PACE model – Primary, Alternate, Contingency and Emergency control Lines and to keep the fires as small as <br />
possible<br />
while working toward full containment.<br />
The Devil’s Knob Complex is now under the management of the Southern Area Red Team – transfer of <br />
command from<br />
Great Basin Team 2 took place this morning at 6:00a.m.<br />
Closures: Copies of all closures and maps can be found at https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/closures/7758/.<br />
• UPDATE to BLM Roseburg District fire closure. The Francis Creek Road area and Scaredman Campground <br />
are<br />
again under a closure order due to potential fire activity, and to keep the area clear for firefighting operations.<br />
• The Umpqua and Willamette National Forests have area closure orders to encompass the Rough Patch, <br />
Jack,<br />
Archie Creek, and Devil's Knob Fire Areas. The closure includes Canton Creek Campground, Musick Guard <br />
Station,<br />
and Cover Campground.<br />
• Highway 138 between Roseburg and Diamond Lake and Crater Lake remains open. Slow down and be alert <br />
while<br />
passing through the fire area.<br />
Chaos and Little Bend Fires: Securing the west side of the Chaos is progressing well – burnout operations are<br />
complete on this flank of the fire and firefighters are focused on holding the fire in place to prevent spread to <br />
the<br />
west. The primary containment lines of these fires lay on the west and northwest flanks. Crews are working to <br />
the<br />
north from Canton Point through Shane Saddle and onto Bohemia Mountain to construct fire line to secure <br />
the Chaos<br />
fire from moving to the northwest. Additional work is being done on the southeast side of the Chaos fire to <br />
prevent<br />
the fire from moving south then to the west. On the Little Bend Fire, the west mid-section of the fire is <br />
contained and<br />
holding well 0 containment lines are complete between the Chaos and the Little Bend Fire.<br />
Jack and Buckhead Fires: The Jack Fire has containment lines that are holding on the west, north, and east <br />
flanks of<br />
the fires and these lines account for a large amount of containment of the fire. The Buckhead fire has burned <br />
into the<br />
Jack fire to the north - fire crews are patrolling these flanks and taking action to hold the lines as necessary. <br />
The<br />
southwest and south flanks of the fire are seeing moderate fire behavior – tactics on these flanks include <br />
direct dozer<br />
line, the construction of primary and alternate contingency lines using the road system, building and <br />
reinforcing<br />
contingency lines and conducting burnout operations as opportunities arise.<br />
Near Minky Fire: This fire lays south of the Jack and Buckhead Fires. The east flank of the fire has been <br />
contained.<br />
The nearby Smith Fire that is part of the Devil’s Knob Complex is actively growing to the northeast into Ash <br />
Valley.<br />
Because of this, additional firefighting resources have been moved into Ash Valley to assist in containing the <br />
Smith<br />
Fire while looking for opportunities to construct containment lines for both the Smith and Near Minky Fires. <br />
This area<br />
is the focus area and priority for today’s firefighting operations. The Near Minky Fire is at 0% containment.<br />
Weather: Winds over all the fires are predominately out of the northwest. As smoke clears, fire activity is <br />
expected to<br />
increase. Gust up to 15 mph can further promote fire spread. Afternoon relative humidity is expected to be in <br />
the<br />
mid- 20s to the upper 30s which will also promote elevated burning conditions.</span>

<br />
Yesterday: Crews finished their work to remove trees and brush along Bumping River Road to use it as a <br />
containment line for the fire. Heavy equipment was then shifted to the Bumping River and Naches River corridors <br />
so crews and engines could continue structure preparation efforts several miles north of the current fire <br />
perimeter. Fire activity remains moderate near Little Rattlesnake Creek where helicopters doing bucket drops <br />
continue to cool hot spots in areas that are steep and unsafe for firefighters to engage directly. Firefighters and <br />
dozers continued the work of extending indirect containment lines along Bethel Ridge on Washington <br />
Department of Natural Resources managed lands moving west toward the William O. Douglas Wilderness <br />
boundary on the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest yesterday. Night operations on the southern end of the <br />
fire continued to improve and extend the indirect line as conditions allowed.<br />
<br />
Today: If conditions remain favorable today, crews are planning to initiate firing operations along the indirect <br />
containment line on Bethel Ridge in the southeast to prevent the spread of the fire towards Naches and critical <br />
infrastructure. Additional crews and engines were made available to focus on this operation which is expected to <br />
take multiple days to complete. On the southwest portion of the fire, heavy equipment will still be working in the <br />
area of the 1500 road system down towards Wildcat Road to complete indirect fire line from the wilderness <br />
boundary to Bethel Ridge. Fire managers do anticipate some additional smoke across the fire area today, due in <br />
part to the firing operation while also anticipating that prevailing southeast winds and lower humidity will increase <br />
fire behavior on the west flank. While the fire is only minimally active on the northern portion, with material rolling <br />
and backing down steep slopes, crews remain focused on structure protection in these areas and continue the <br />
work of preparing those homes and outbuildings along the Highway 410 corridor and US 12. Crews will continue <br />
to mop up private property outside of the Nile community as firefighters extend structure protection efforts along <br />
the corridor.<br />
 <br />
Due to the large number of fires nationally, there are a limited amount of firefighting resources. Firefighters and <br />
suppression resources will shift around the fire to protect communities, limit further fire spread, and focus their <br />
actions where to have the greatest success.  <br />
 <br />
Evacuations: LEVEL 3: Bumping River Road from north to south; LEVEL 2: Hwy 410 from Bumping River Road <br />
to U.S. Route 12. LEVEL 1: From U.S. 12 at Hwy 410 west to Tieton Reservoir Road; Yakima County Office of <br />
Emergency Management’s official Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/YakimaCountyOEM. Yakima <br />
County geo-specific emergency alert system: www.yakimacounty.us/2222/Alert-Yakima. A Red Cross shelter has <br />
been established at Summit View Church of Christ, 100 North 72nd Avenue in Yakima.</span>

Inchelium, WA – The Summit Trail Fire was started by lightning on July 12 and is burning on the Colville <br />
Reservation approximately 17 miles west of Inchelium. The fire has burned 45,554 acres and is now at 43 <br />
percent containment.<br />
Northwest Incident Management Team 7 will take command of the Summit Trail Fire tomorrow at 6:00 a.m. <br />
NW Team 7, led by Incident Commander Jason Loomis, will shadow outgoing NW Team 10 today to gain <br />
intelligence and ensure a smooth transition.<br />
<br />
Yesterday, on the south and west portions of the fire, firefighters continued mop up operations, mopping up <br />
150 feet from the containment lines. Fire crews continue monitoring and patrolling those lines around the fire <br />
perimeter for any hot spots. Crews began backhauling pumps and hoses as they completed their work around <br />
the fire.<br />
The overall tactics for the northern and eastern perimeters focus on using heavy equipment to install direct <br />
fireline and engines to mop up. Hand crews and dozers, supported by bucket drops from a Type I helicopter, <br />
improved containment lines in preparation for burning operations in upper Stall Creek and along the Midslope <br />
Road down to Hall Creek. East and west along Onion Ridge, firefighters went direct with containment lines <br />
when conditions were favorable. When less favorable, indirect lines were established in preparation for <br />
possible burnout operations. West of Bear Springs, crews monitored fire activity as it slowly backed down to <br />
Hall Creek Road. Firefighters working on the Summit Trail Fire assisted the Colville Agency and responded to <br />
one Initial Attack, called the 23 Mile Fire, northwest of Cody Butte. The fire is two acres in size and resources <br />
on the scene were able to contain the fire. <br />
Another day of sunshine will bring warmer temperatures to the region, with highs expected in the 70’s. <br />
Members of the Washington National Guard will be integrating into firefighting crews to assist with operational <br />
tactics along Sitdown Creek. Firefighters will complete containment line preparation on Bitterfoot Mountain <br />
and monitor weather and fuel conditions for opportunities to burn small areas to strengthen lines. Smoke may <br />
be visible from these areas.<br />
The Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation announced that the Colville Reservation will reopen to <br />
industrial activities and the general public on Friday, August 27, 2021 at 12:01 am. For more information about <br />
the Colville Indian Tribes, visit https://www.colvilletribes.com/. <br />
<br />
Northwest Team 10 Incident Commander Alan Lawson would like to thank The Colville Confederated Tribes, <br />
Department of Natural Resources, our cooperators, stakeholders, and the community of Inchelium, for their <br />
cooperation in this firefighting effort. Special thanks to the Inchelium School, Inchelium Community Center, <br />
and Inchelium Campus of Spokane Community College for allowing the team to use their facilities as our <br />
Incident Command Post. Although we are already in a difficult fire season, especially with COVID-19 <br />
restrictions, it is the cooperation such as we have experienced here that has enabled us to meet firefighting <br />
objectives in a safe and efficient manner.</span>

<br />
Yesterday, a community meeting was held to announce the evacuation level has been downgraded to Level 2 for <br />
South Lake Shore Drive starting from the Sherriff’s checkpoint at milepost 3 going north. Access to the area <br />
continues to be for residents and property owners only. 25 Mile State Park and Fields Point Landing remain <br />
closed to the public and the status will continue to be evaluated daily.<br />
 <br />
Crews completed a containment line from Grouse Mountain west to Junior Point and from Junior Point to DP 50. <br />
Heavy equipment and crews continued to prepare lines to the south near Slide Ridge in anticipation for strategic <br />
firing operations when weather and fuel conditions align. Crews maintained an overnight shift, reinforcing <br />
structure protection operations in and around properties and homes.<br />
 <br />
Today, fire behavior is expected to increase as the warmer weather dries fuels out. Heavy equipment and crews <br />
will continue to construct line from 125 RD to the finger. Along the southern and western edges of the fire crews <br />
will continue to prepare for strategic firing operations specifically looking at areas to the south of the fire near <br />
Slide Ridge and west towards Devils Backbone. On the northern perimeter of the fire, crews are improving the <br />
line working south towards Angle Peak.<br />
 <br />
Rotor and fixed-wing air resources will continue working on the fire throughout the day and improved weather <br />
conditions make the use of aviation assets more likely today. Aircraft may use local bodies of water, including <br />
Lake Chelan. Recreational boaters should be aware of aircraft takeoff and landings and keep a safe distance.<br />
 <br />
The Twentyfive Mile Fire was first reported at 3:45 p.m. on August 15, 2021. The fire was initially burning on the <br />
south shore of Lake Chelan near Twentyfive Mile Creek and has expanded south and west of the area. The fire <br />
is under joint jurisdiction of the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest, Washington Department of Natural <br />
Resources, Bureau of Land Management and Chelan County Fire District 7.<br />
 <br />
Weather: There is no anticipated rain in the forecast for the next week. Today temperatures are expected to be <br />
cooler with South to Northwest/West winds gusting 20-30 mph. The early evening there is potential for cloud <br />
cover.<br />
 <br />
Evacuations: The most up-to-date evacuation information is available through Chelan County Emergency <br />
Management at the following links. The Chelan County Sherriff will update evacuation levels as conditions <br />
warrant.<br />
 <br />
Evacuation Information<br />
Evacuation Area Maps<br />
 <br />

 <br />
Level 1 (Get Ready) South Lakeshore Road south of Slide Ridge.<br />
 <br />
Closures: A forest area closure has been issued in the Twentyfive Mile Creek area. Maps of the closure area are <br />
available here. All roads in the Level 3 area are closed to the general public including Lakeshore Road. <br />
Residents are asked to avoid travel on open areas of Lakeshore Road to make way for firefighting personnel and <br />
equipment.<br />
 <br />
Smoke Information: Lower temperatures are creating clearer skies, however, smoke and haze may develop later <br />
in the afternoon. Visit https://wasmoke.blogspot.com/ for local air quality information.<br />
 <br />
Fire Restrictions: Campfire restrictions are in effect. Campfires are prohibited throughout the Okanogan-<br />

<br />
Current Situation:<br />
<br />
Areas of both fires continue to hold significant heat, even in areas that have been burning for three weeks.<br />
Crews continue to staff night operations, patrolling and monitoring overnight fire activity on both fires.<br />
As fire activity lessens and firefighting activity slows, resources can begin to assess damage to private <br />
property.<br />
The Rocky Mountain Incident Management Blue Team will transition with the Type 2 Pacific Northwest Team <br />
12, which will assume command of both fires tomorrow, Thursday, August 26.<br />
Operational plan for today: <br />
<br />
Direct line construction is complete around many sides of the fire perimeter, including the southwest corner, <br />
along Summer Road and Bonaparte Road, and the Lost Lake area. Crews will continue working in those <br />
areas, to remove heat and secure around structures. <br />
Indirect contingency lines are being prepared using heavy equipment along the 33 Road and southeast of <br />
Havillah in preparation for future burnout operations.<br />
Crews are preparing structures outside of the fire perimeter for potential fire, assessing protection needs and <br />
setting up pumps, hoses, and sprinkler kits.<br />
Fire conditions and weather:<br />
<br />
Today's weather will be warmer and dryer than it has been for the past week. Temperatures will range from 65 <br />
to 75 degrees, with relative humidity dropping to around 15 to 25 percent. Skies will be sunny with light winds. <br />
Fuels are gradually drying since the rain that was received on both fires over last weekend. Fire behavior is <br />
expected to increase with lower relative humidity and higher temperatures, with moderate fire behavior <br />
expected today.<br />
