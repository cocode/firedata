WATCH FOR FIRE TRAFFIC: As you begin your Labor Day holiday weekend, remember you are sharing the road with wildland fire crews in <br />
the area. We ask everyone to slow down, particularly along Highway 138, and be vigilant to keep the community and our firefighters safe.<br />
Weather: Cloudy with chance of light rain in the morning, clearing in the afternoon. Temperatures in the 80s with winds from the west-<br />
northwest. Smoke in the air may be an issue for aircraft today.<br />
<br />
Big Swamp Fire: This area was sheltered from Friday's winds and is looking good. Crews continue patrol firelines and mop up and secure <br />
isolated heat and chipping operations.<br />
<br />
Potter Fire: Suppression repair work continues and firefighters pulled hose lay off one side of the fire. Hose lays are hose that extends from an <br />
engine to the fire. Crews are moving logs and brush off the road.<br />
<br />
Camel Hump Fire: Local firefighter resources will continue to patrol the area; no heat has been detected in the past 24 hours.<br />
<br />
Windigo Fire: On Friday evening, there was an uptick in fire behavior below Windigo Butte, sending a column of smoke to north. Fire activity <br />
was from an unburned island of fuels within the interior of the containment lines.<br />
<br />
Two helicopters responded and crews were on site outside the containment lines patrolling for any spot fires.<br />
Firefighters will be on site again today checking that area. Suppression repair work was completed with the excavator and ready to blade the <br />
road.<br />
<br />
Resources: 12 hand crews, 10 engines, 2 dozers, 20 water tenders, 0 helicopters, 2 masticators. Total<br />
personnel 421<br />
<br />
Closures: The Pacific Crest Trail is open. The Deschutes and Umpqua National Forests (NF) has fire closures around the Windigo fire. The <br />
Willamette National Forest reduced fire closures around the Big Swamp Fire, opening many roads south of Diamond Drive (Forest Road 21). <br />
To provide for public and firefighter safety, the Umpqua NF issued a closure for the Camel Hump Fire. More information at:<br />
Umpqua National Forest Alerts "https://www.fs.usda.gov/alerts/umpqua/alerts-notices" Willamette NF:<br />
https://bit.ly/3cv1Ms6, and Deschutes NF: https://bit.ly/3pMM0vP.<br />
Help keep firefighters safe by adhering to the closure orders!<br />
<br />
FIRE RESTRICTIONS: Campfires in designated campgrounds or picnic areas only, in fixed permanent metal fire pits. Open fires are not <br />
allowed in dispersed campsites. Check the Willamette and Umpqua National Forest websites for specific public use fire restrictions.</span>

The Boulder Mountain Fire started by lightning on Wednesday August 31, 2022 at approximately 8:30 pm. The fire is located in the Tacoma <br />
Creek and Boulder Mountain area northwest of Cusick, Washington. The fire is burning on Federal, State and Private land. The terrain is <br />
difficult and the fire is burning in heavy timber, slash, and beetle infested trees. The Northeast Washington Interagency Incident Management <br />
Team Type 3 Team 2 has assumed command of the fire as of this morning. <br />
<br />
The fire is in an area that is difficult to reach with crews at this time. The primary objective today is scouting and shoring up road systems to <br />
the fire and creating additional access points. Air resources will continue to be in the area and assist crews on the ground to work areas that <br />
need immediate attention. There are level 3 evacuation orders in place. The fire is approximately 2000 acres and is 0% contained. <br />
<br />
With the Labor Day weekend upon us we ask that the public stay out of the area. There are several fire apparatuses and personnel working in <br />
the area of Tacoma Creek and Boulder Mountain. Please check the Colville Forest website for the most up to date closure information for <br />
campgrounds @ dnr.wa.gov and evacuation updates at: https://pendoreilleco.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Boulder-Mountain-Fire-Level-3-<br />
Evacuation-Area.pdf <br />
<br />
Very hot and dry conditions are expected in the area today and a Red Flag warning in effect today from noon to 9:00 pm tonight.  Southeast <br />
winds around 5-7 mph with gusts near 11 mph. Winds are expected to be terrain driven in the up-slope areas and create erratic fire behavior. <br />
The weather will continue to be hot and dry over the next several days.<br />
<br />
Be sure to check before you travel to the area for a drive, hiking, or camping. There are several hazards that have been created from the fire. <br />
For your safety and the safety of our firefighters we ask you to stay clear of the area.  <br />
<br />
Fire information and the Incident Command Post is located at the Kalispel Pow Wow Grounds in Usk, WA. Fire information contact is Don <br />
Malone at (509) 822-8125 or you can also follow us on Facebook @NEWIMT3</span>

Current Situation: Fire growth has increased toward Furnish Creek in the northern area of the fire. The fire spotted over the retardant line in the <br />
southeast area of the fire near Nettle Creek. The north section burned into an older burn scar. Last night, relative humidities recovered well, this <br />
combined with lingering clouds throughout the morning will help the fire be less active because of higher moisture levels in the atmosphere. Once <br />
the sun comes out in the afternoon fire activity will increase but growth is anticipated to be less than yesterday.<br />
<br />
Today’s Activities: The northern part of the fire reached an area that is safer to staff today. Fire crews are making deliberate choices on engaging <br />
the fire where chances of success are high. In the southwest area of the fire crews will be holding the fire along roads and fire lines. Holding means <br />
to watch out for any spot fires across fireline and extinguish them. Operations will also consider burning back into the fire where feasible. <br />
Helicopters will be helping with water drops when visibility allows.<br />
<br />
Evacuations: Increased fire activity has prompted an increase in evacuation levels for areas around the Cedar Creek Fire.<br />
<br />

to the Charlton Lake and Taylor Lake areas. Forest Service Road 19 (Aufderheide Drive) from milepost 20 (just east of Kiahanie Campground) to <br />
milepost 35 (south of Roaring River Campground). This includes the Box Canyon Campground, Box Canyon Staging Area/Horse Camp and <br />
Skookum Creek Campground and all surrounding dispersed camping areas. Irish and Taylor Lake campgrounds and dispersed camping in the <br />
Charlton and Taylor lakes areas and north along the Pacific Crest Trail to Lindick Lake.<br />
 LEVEL 2 (BE SET) is in effect for<br />
<br />
• The area between Taylor Lake and Lemish Lake along the Taylor Burn Road, including the Many Lakes and Metolius-Windigo Trailheads. Level 2 <br />

<br />
Weather:  A cold front is expected to move through northeastern Oregon Saturday morning, resulting in a shift to west winds, cooler <br />
temperatures in the 70s and 80s and higher humidity. Cloudy skies should clear in the morning hours with a chance for late morning and early <br />
afternoon isolated showers and thunderstorms. However, little to no rainfall is expected. Winds are expected to shift to the northwest late <br />
afternoon and diminish Saturday night. <br />
<br />
Operations: Hotshot crews continued work yesterday to increase depth on the containment line along FSR 45 by conducting limited tactical <br />
firing operations. These operations consume understory fuels ahead of the wildfire, which slows or stops fire activity when the main fire meets <br />
up with the “black” (burned area) produced from the firing operations. These tactics create a wider containment line that reduces the likelihood <br />
that an ember from interior fire could travel across the line when wind pushes the fire in that direction. <br />
<br />
Fixed-wing Single Engine Aircraft Tankers (SEATs) were used to aid firefighters along the western flank of the fire throughout the day yesterday. <br />
These water drops cool down the most active parts of the fire and create fuel moisture that helps to slow fire spread. This work will continue <br />
today, along with helicopter bucket drops to cool areas of more intense heat. <br />
<br />
Increased fire activity continues to challenge firefighters who are working on the north edge of the fire near Indian Rock Lookout. Even in rocky <br />
areas with fewer fuels to consume, the record high temperatures and low fuel moistures this week have contributed to fire spread where winds <br />
carry embers and start spot fires. Firefighters have been aggressive in locating and containing new spot fires around the fire perimeter this <br />
week. A full suppression strategy is still underway across the fire, using indirect and direct line construction and maximizing the use of aerial and <br />
ground resources.  <br />
<br />
Closures and Evacuations:  Grant County has issued a Level One evacuation advisory in the area of the fire. Level One means be ready and <br />
aware of fire conditions. You can view a map of the evacuation zone on the Grant County Emergency Management Facebook page. An <br />
expanded closure is in effect on the Malheur National Forest today. For complete closure information, please go to:  <br />

Highlights: Pacific Northwest Team 2 assumed command of the Double Creek and Eagle Cap Wilderness Fires (Sturgill, Nebo, and Goat <br />
Mountain) at 6:00 a.m. on Saturday, September 3.<br />
<br />
Double Creek Fire: 3,843 acres | 0% contained | 192 personnel assigned<br />
<br />
The lightning caused Double Creek Fire is a full suppression fire, and the protection of lives and property are the primary objectives of this <br />
incident. Firefighters will minimize fire spread to the north and west of the Double Creek Fire to prevent adverse impacts to values along the <br />
Imnaha River and the community of Imnaha. Overnight, the Double Creek Fire moved into Adams and Double Creek drainages. There was <br />
also additional growth in the Granny Creek drainage towards Freezeout Road. Today, firefighters will continue to focus on providing structure <br />
protection along the Imnaha River and Freezeout Roads. They are also working to keep the fire east of the Upper Imnaha Road and will <br />
improve dozer lines on the west side of the fire. On the north side and west sides of the fire, firefighters will be scouting ridges to identify <br />
control features and keep the fire out of Hells Canyon. Aircraft will assist firefighters on the ground, as conditions allow, to minimize the spread <br />
of the fire.<br />
<br />
Weather: Temperatures will be in the 70s on ridgetops and 80s on the lower elevations with relative humidity values of 15-20 percent on the <br />
ridges and 8-14 percent in the drainages. South winds will be 10-20 mph on ridges and 7-14 mph on the lower slopes. There is a slight <br />
chance of thunderstorms in the afternoon. Temperatures will cool to the mid-50s in the evening with relative humidity values of 50%.<br />
<br />
Smoke: An Air Resource Advisor has been ordered to assist in the development of localized smoke forecast outlooks. The smoke forest <br />
outlooks, when available, will be posted to the Smoke Forecast Outlooks website and on InciWeb. Air quality information is also available on <br />
the PurpleAir website.<br />
<br />
Evacuations: There are current evacuations in place for the Double Creek Fire. Hat Point and Freezeout Roads are under a Level 3 “Go Now” <br />
evacuation. The Hat Point Road is also closed due to the fire activity. Imnaha River Road, from Rippleton Creek to the Imnaha Grange is <br />
under a Level 2 “Get Set” evacuation. Imnaha River Road, from the town of Imnaha to Rippleton Creek and from the Imnaha Grange to the <br />
Pallette Ranch including Imnaha River Woods is under a Level 1 “Be Ready” evacuation. <br />
<br />
Closures: There are currently trail and road closures in effect for the Double Creek Fire as well as the Eagle Cap Wilderness Fires. Closure <br />
Orders and Maps are available on the Wallowa Whitman National Forest Fire Incident Updates page. Wallowa County issued an Order to <br />
restrict use by the general public of the Upper Imnaha Road from Imnaha to the junction of Upper Imnaha Road and Forest Service Road 39.<br />
<br />
Air Space: Several Notice to Air Missions (NOTAMs) have been issued for areas surrounding the Double Creek and Eagle Cap Wilderness <br />
Fires. NOTAM 2/0826 and NOTAM 2/0849 have been issued to provide a safe environment for firefighting aircraft. Do not operate drones near <br />
wildfires. If public drones are flying in areas of wildfire activity, tactical firefighting aircraft will be grounded.<br />
<br />
Restrictions: Forest Order # 06-16-00-22-04 covers Phase B Fire Restrictions for all National Forest System Lands within the Wallowa-<br />
Whitman National Forest, except for the area within a ¼ mile of the Snake River between Hells Canyon Dam, River Mile 247.5, downstream <br />
to the Oregon-Washington border at Snake River Mile 176.0, which is regulated by Forest Order #06-16-04-22-01.</span>

						    <span class="textarea">Irving Peak fire being staffed and managed by White River Incident Management Team<br />
<br />
September 3, 2022<br />
<br />
Plain, WA – Lightning started the White River and Irving Peak Fires on August 11. The fires are burning on the Okanagan-Wenatchee National <br />
Forest, northwest of Plain, WA.<br />
<br />
Suppression Strategy – Fire managers are refining a long-term strategy including the use of primary and contingency perimeter lines for <br />
containment. Tactics include completion and reinforcement of fire lines (roads and hand line).<br />
<br />
Operations – A cold front will be moving into the area with slightly higher humidity, lower temperatures and very strong winds, gusts possibly <br />
up to 35 mph. Wind alignment with the topographical features near the fires could test the work on control lines completed to date. No <br />
structures have been lost due to these fires.  The increased local fire activity and smoke from Oregon fires pushing northward will bring <br />
additional smoke into the area. Smoke columns could be visible to the public as large amounts of fuels are consumed.<br />
<br />
White River Fire - Acres: 1,249; 1% contained<br />
Location: Sears Creek area of the White River drainage, approximately 14 miles NW of Plain, WA.<br />
<br />
Yesterday, the White River Fire remained active along the southwest edge and the fire burned over the top of Wenatchee Ridge. Roll out of <br />
burning material is anticipated resulting in uphill runs.  The fire was also active on the southeast edge. Helicopter water drops were utilized to <br />
cool some hotter fire areas. Temperatures did not reach predicted highs due to a slight smoke layer. Today, firefighters will continue monitoring <br />
the southern portion of the fire for increased fire activity and fire movement due to the predicted winds. Firefighting resources remain ready for <br />
initial attack on any new fire starts and back haul unused equipment.<br />
<br />
Irving Peak Fire - Acres: 2,829; 7% contained<br />
Location: Approximately 16 miles NW of Plain, WA<br />
<br />
The Irving Peak Fire moved southeast into a rock band. The concern is winds could increase the spotting distance and blow embers across <br />
the band. The completed burnout operations on a portion of the southeast perimeter along Forest Service Road (FSR) 6504 to FSR 200 held, <br />
increasing the total containment of Irving Peak to seven percent. Masticating and chipping along spur road 200 to the 311 continues. Today, <br />
firefighters will continue to improve control lines, clear debris and keep a watchful eye on any developing smoke from fire activity. <br />
<br />
Weather and Fire Behavior – A dry cold front moved across the region and will create cooler and windy conditions with higher afternoon <br />
relative humidity today. This is a watch-out for fire behavior to produce very active and erratic fire activity.  Today’s forecast calls for <br />
temperatures of 77-83 degrees in the valley and 63-68 degrees on the ridgetops; relative humidity of 35-45% in the valleys and 45-50% on the <br />
ridgetops; winds in the valleys will be NW 5-10 mph with gust to 20 mph throughout the day and ridgetops W/NW 10-20 mph with gusts to 35 <br />
mph.<br />
<br />
Closures – Several road and area closures are in place for the safety of firefighters and the public. Fire managers are asking people to please <br />
respect these closures while recreating in the area. An emergency closure, issued by the Forest Service, remains in place for the Little <br />
Wenatchee Road (Forest Service Road [FSR] 65) to include the section between the National Forest boundary and the junction of FSR 65 <br />
and FSR 6700.   <br />
<br />

WATCH FOR FIRE TRAFFIC: As you begin your Labor Day holiday weekend, remember you are sharing the road with wildland fire crews in <br />
the area. We ask everyone to slow down, particularly along Highway 138, and be vigilant to keep the community and our firefighters safe.<br />
Weather: Cloudy with chance of light rain in the morning, clearing in the afternoon. Temperatures in the 80s with winds from the west-<br />
northwest. Smoke in the air may be an issue for aircraft today.<br />
<br />
Big Swamp Fire: This area was sheltered from Friday's winds and is looking good. Crews continue patrol firelines and mop up and secure <br />
isolated heat and chipping operations.<br />
<br />
Potter Fire: Suppression repair work continues and firefighters pulled hose lay off one side of the fire. Hose lays are hose that extends from an <br />
engine to the fire. Crews are moving logs and brush off the road.<br />
<br />
Camel Hump Fire: Local firefighter resources will continue to patrol the area; no heat has been detected in the past 24 hours.<br />
<br />
Windigo Fire: On Friday evening, there was an uptick in fire behavior below Windigo Butte, sending a column of smoke to north. Fire activity <br />
was from an unburned island of fuels within the interior of the containment lines.<br />
<br />
Two helicopters responded and crews were on site outside the containment lines patrolling for any spot fires.<br />
Firefighters will be on site again today checking that area. Suppression repair work was completed with the excavator and ready to blade the <br />
road.<br />
<br />
Resources: 12 hand crews, 10 engines, 2 dozers, 20 water tenders, 0 helicopters, 2 masticators. Total<br />
personnel 421<br />
<br />
Closures: The Pacific Crest Trail is open. The Deschutes and Umpqua National Forests (NF) has fire closures around the Windigo fire. The <br />
Willamette National Forest reduced fire closures around the Big Swamp Fire, opening many roads south of Diamond Drive (Forest Road 21). <br />
To provide for public and firefighter safety, the Umpqua NF issued a closure for the Camel Hump Fire. More information at:<br />
Umpqua National Forest Alerts "https://www.fs.usda.gov/alerts/umpqua/alerts-notices" Willamette NF:<br />
https://bit.ly/3cv1Ms6, and Deschutes NF: https://bit.ly/3pMM0vP.<br />
Help keep firefighters safe by adhering to the closure orders!<br />
<br />
FIRE RESTRICTIONS: Campfires in designated campgrounds or picnic areas only, in fixed permanent metal fire pits. Open fires are not <br />
allowed in dispersed campsites. Check the Willamette and Umpqua National Forest websites for specific public use fire restrictions.</span>

Rum Creek Fire Holds Through Cold Front<br />
<br />
MERLIN, Ore. – A cold front moved past the Rum Creek Fire late on Friday, bringing gusty winds. The winds were strongest on the ridges and <br />
in drainages with a west-east alignment, with gusts recorded up to 25 mph. The fire stayed within the primary fire lines except for two spot <br />
fires, near Crawford House by Galice and west of McKnabe Creek. Firefighters attacked these spot fires and kept them small. Today, aircraft <br />
will use infrared imaging to search for additional spot fires.<br />
<br />
Currently, most acreage gains on the fire are from strategic firing operations inside the primary control lines. By carefully igniting remaining <br />
fuels inside fire lines, firefighters have more control over the location and rate of fire spread. These operations strengthen the direct fire lines. <br />
Crews are using hand ignition with drip torches and aerial ignitions by the Unmanned Aerial System. Strategic firings usually result in a low-<br />
intensity burn, consuming the ground fuels but not the trees.<br />
<br />
Fire personnel completed a strategic firing operation near Grave Creek yesterday, tying in another critical section of the fire perimeter. Direct <br />
lines are holding the fire, restricting spread further to the east. Where possible, firefighters are using lines hand-dug directly on the edge of the <br />
fire, combined with strategic firings, to stop advancement. In other areas where the fire is burning more intensely or fuels are more abundant, <br />
a direct hand line is unlikely to hold. In these areas, firefighters are using indirect lines constructed by dozers and existing roads as <br />
containment lines. Fire personnel are mopping up residual heat near the fire lines on all areas of the fire.<br />
<br />
On the west, firefighters have completed strategic burning on over half of the line between Mount Peavine and the Rogue River to the north. <br />
This work continued until midnight Friday when the relative humidity (RH) increased. At that point, fine fuels like grasses and brush absorbed <br />
enough moisture and would not burn well. Firing will continue today when fuel and weather conditions are appropriate.<br />
<br />
Office of State Fire Marshal personnel continue to mop up remaining hot spots near structures, and are patrolling areas along Galice Road for <br />
possible spot fires caused by wind-blown embers. Firefighters are working on structure assessment and pre-planning in the Crow Road, Hugo <br />
Road, Quartz Creek Road and Picket Creek Road neighborhoods southeast of the fire.<br />
<br />
Evacuations: Existing evacuation orders and notifications remain in place. An interactive map showing evacuation levels according to address <br />
can be found at //JosephineCounty.gov/FireMap. For the most current evacuation information and resources, go to Josephine County Incident <br />
Information (rvem.org).<br />
<br />
Road control: Josephine County Sheriff’s Office has established traffic access points around the fire zone. Road blocks are located at Galice <br />
Road near Crow Road; Galice Store; Bear Camp Road at Peavine (top intersection); Lower Grave Creek Road at Angora Creek (Grays <br />
Ranch); Quartz Creek Road about 3 miles up (end of County maintenance); Dutch Henry Road near Kelsey Creek (42 44'56.2/123 40'35.4); <br />
and Hog Creek at Galice Road. The National Guard is staffing the roadblocks. Only residents (must show proof of residency) and permitted <br />
users will be allowed through.<br />
<br />
River status: The Wild section of the Rogue River below Grave Creek will remain open unless fire conditions warrant closure. River status is <br />
determined on a day-to-day basis. Please call 541-471-6535 for more information regarding Rogue River permits. No new boating permits will <br />
be issued at this time.</span>

Plain, WA – Lightning started the White River and Irving Peak Fires on August 11. The fires are burning on the Okanagan-Wenatchee National <br />
Forest, northwest of Plain, WA.<br />
<br />
Suppression Strategy – Fire managers are refining a long-term strategy including the use of primary and contingency perimeter lines for <br />
containment. Tactics include completion and reinforcement of fire lines (roads and hand line).<br />
<br />
Operations – A cold front will be moving into the area with slightly higher humidity, lower temperatures and very strong winds, gusts possibly <br />
up to 35 mph. Wind alignment with the topographical features near the fires could test the work on control lines completed to date. No <br />
structures have been lost due to these fires.  The increased local fire activity and smoke from Oregon fires pushing northward will bring <br />
additional smoke into the area. Smoke columns could be visible to the public as large amounts of fuels are consumed.<br />
<br />
White River Fire - Acres: 1,249; 1% contained<br />
Location: Sears Creek area of the White River drainage, approximately 14 miles NW of Plain, WA.<br />
<br />
Yesterday, the White River Fire remained active along the southwest edge and the fire burned over the top of Wenatchee Ridge. Roll out of <br />
burning material is anticipated resulting in uphill runs.  The fire was also active on the southeast edge. Helicopter water drops were utilized to <br />
cool some hotter fire areas. Temperatures did not reach predicted highs due to a slight smoke layer. Today, firefighters will continue monitoring <br />
the southern portion of the fire for increased fire activity and fire movement due to the predicted winds. Firefighting resources remain ready for <br />
initial attack on any new fire starts and back haul unused equipment.<br />
<br />
Irving Peak Fire - Acres: 2,829; 7% contained<br />
Location: Approximately 16 miles NW of Plain, WA<br />
<br />
The Irving Peak Fire moved southeast into a rock band. The concern is winds could increase the spotting distance and blow embers across <br />
the band. The completed burnout operations on a portion of the southeast perimeter along Forest Service Road (FSR) 6504 to FSR 200 held, <br />
increasing the total containment of Irving Peak to seven percent. Masticating and chipping along spur road 200 to the 311 continues. Today, <br />
firefighters will continue to improve control lines, clear debris and keep a watchful eye on any developing smoke from fire activity. <br />
<br />
Weather and Fire Behavior – A dry cold front moved across the region and will create cooler and windy conditions with higher afternoon <br />
relative humidity today. This is a watch-out for fire behavior to produce very active and erratic fire activity.  Today’s forecast calls for <br />
temperatures of 77-83 degrees in the valley and 63-68 degrees on the ridgetops; relative humidity of 35-45% in the valleys and 45-50% on the <br />
ridgetops; winds in the valleys will be NW 5-10 mph with gust to 20 mph throughout the day and ridgetops W/NW 10-20 mph with gusts to 35 <br />
mph.<br />
<br />
Closures – Several road and area closures are in place for the safety of firefighters and the public. Fire managers are asking people to please <br />
respect these closures while recreating in the area. An emergency closure, issued by the Forest Service, remains in place for the Little <br />
Wenatchee Road (Forest Service Road [FSR] 65) to include the section between the National Forest boundary and the junction of FSR 65 <br />
and FSR 6700.   <br />
<br />

WATCH FOR FIRE TRAFFIC: As you begin your Labor Day holiday weekend, remember you are sharing the road with wildland fire crews in <br />
the area. We ask everyone to slow down, particularly along Highway 138, and be vigilant to keep the community and our firefighters safe.<br />
Weather: Cloudy with chance of light rain in the morning, clearing in the afternoon. Temperatures in the 80s with winds from the west-<br />
northwest. Smoke in the air may be an issue for aircraft today.<br />
<br />
Big Swamp Fire: This area was sheltered from Friday's winds and is looking good. Crews continue patrol firelines and mop up and secure <br />
isolated heat and chipping operations.<br />
<br />
Potter Fire: Suppression repair work continues and firefighters pulled hose lay off one side of the fire. Hose lays are hose that extends from an <br />
engine to the fire. Crews are moving logs and brush off the road.<br />
<br />
Camel Hump Fire: Local firefighter resources will continue to patrol the area; no heat has been detected in the past 24 hours.<br />
<br />
Windigo Fire: On Friday evening, there was an uptick in fire behavior below Windigo Butte, sending a column of smoke to north. Fire activity <br />
was from an unburned island of fuels within the interior of the containment lines.<br />
<br />
Two helicopters responded and crews were on site outside the containment lines patrolling for any spot fires.<br />
Firefighters will be on site again today checking that area. Suppression repair work was completed with the excavator and ready to blade the <br />
road.<br />
<br />
Resources: 12 hand crews, 10 engines, 2 dozers, 20 water tenders, 0 helicopters, 2 masticators. Total<br />
personnel 421<br />
<br />
Closures: The Pacific Crest Trail is open. The Deschutes and Umpqua National Forests (NF) has fire closures around the Windigo fire. The <br />
Willamette National Forest reduced fire closures around the Big Swamp Fire, opening many roads south of Diamond Drive (Forest Road 21). <br />
To provide for public and firefighter safety, the Umpqua NF issued a closure for the Camel Hump Fire. More information at:<br />
Umpqua National Forest Alerts "https://www.fs.usda.gov/alerts/umpqua/alerts-notices" Willamette NF:<br />
https://bit.ly/3cv1Ms6, and Deschutes NF: https://bit.ly/3pMM0vP.<br />
Help keep firefighters safe by adhering to the closure orders!<br />
<br />
FIRE RESTRICTIONS: Campfires in designated campgrounds or picnic areas only, in fixed permanent metal fire pits. Open fires are not <br />
allowed in dispersed campsites. Check the Willamette and Umpqua National Forest websites for specific public use fire restrictions.</span>
