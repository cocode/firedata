Current Status: The overnight infrared flight could not fly due to cloud cover and weather so there is no change in <br />
reported fire size today. The smoke was slow to clear out yesterday which resulted in moderated fire activity. The <br />
fire was still active and continued to spread in the Upper Dickey Creek, Mother Lode Creek, and Battle <br />
drainages. The fire also moved slowly to the south in the Elk Lake Creek and East Humbug Creek drainages and <br />
alongside the slope in the Upper Collawash drainage. The south and east sides of the fire were covered in a <br />
heavy layer of smoke for most of the day which prohibited helicopter use. The south and north containment lines <br />
were patrolled and monitored for any areas of heat along the line.  Along the southwest and southeast corners <br />
crews worked on strengthening primary lines built on the road system and made sure that that the hose lines and <br />
pumps are secured and ready to be used. Extensive mop up work was done along Forest Road 6350 on the east <br />
side of the fire as crews work to secure that edge to keep the fire within containment line. The two spot fires east <br />
of the line remain secured. Firefighters worked to prepare road systems and hand lines north and northwest of <br />
the fire area to be primary or contingency lines as part of the long-term fire suppression strategy. Preparation <br />
work is being done along an estimated 40 miles of forest roads as a part of these efforts.<br />
<br />
Planned Actions: Fire activity is expected to remain active in the Upper Dickey Creek, Mother Lode Creek, <br />
Pansey Creek, and Battle Creek drainages but could moderate if the forecasted rain occurs. If the smoke clears <br />
helicopters will be used to make water drops and slow fire spread in key area. Crews and equipment will be used <br />
to prepare lines using several road systems northwest and north of the fire area. Existing containment lines will <br />
be monitored as firefighters watch for any trees or pockets of heat that could threaten the lines. Mop up work and <br />
hazard tree removal will be done along Forest Road 6350 to secure the fire line and the spot fires from several <br />
days ago will be monitored. Along the south side fire crews will use tactical firing as needed along Forest Road <br />
4696 to keep the fire edge even and fire intensity lowered as the fire backs down into East Humbug Creek. <br />
Firefighters will remain alert for changing conditions.<br />
<br />
Weather: There is a chance for some light rain today with less than 0.25 inch expected. Temperatures will be 65-<br />
70 degrees, minimum humidity levels from 50% to 70%, and winds out of the west 5-10 mph with gusts up to 15 <br />
mph.<br />
<br />
Evacuations:  The Marion County Sheriff has issued a Level 1 “Be Ready” evacuation advisory only for <br />
Breitenbush Hot Springs. Residents should be aware of the danger that exists in their area, monitor emergency <br />
services websites and local media, and make an action plan should the evacuation level rise. The advisory can <br />
be viewed at:  https://www.flashalert.net/id/MarionSheriff?alert=1.<br />
<br />
Closures:  For the safety of wildland firefighters and the public, the National Forests have enacted area closures <br />
that prevent the public from being upon National Forest System lands in the vicinity of the Bull Complex Fire. All <br />
Forest lands that are south and west of Forest Road 46, and east of the Riverside Fire perimeter are closed. The <br />
entire length of Forest Road 46 is closed. Lands within the 2020 Lionshead and Beachie Creek Fire areas are <br />
also closed.  See the closure orders and maps at https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/closures/7773/.<br />

Cedar Creek Fire: The fire is 55,187 acres and 87% contained. Firefighters continue to focus their efforts on <br />
mopping up hot spots and smoky areas along Highway 20. The thermal cameras are being used around structures <br />
and private lands to locate additional hot spots in the area. Excavators, graders, and dozers are improving and <br />
repairing dozer lines. Aerial resources will be in the immediate area throughout the hillsides providing additional <br />
assistance along with buckets of water where needed. The cedar creek fire will transition into a local type 3 team <br />
on Tuesday morning.</span>

Warmer temperatures today could lead to increased smoke from the interior of the fires, particularly on the <br />
northwestern portion of the Walker Creek Fire. These interior smokes do not threaten containment<br />
lines and may persist until a significant weather event occurs.<br />
<br />
Operations<br />
Firefighters continue to backhaul unnecessary pumps, hoses, equipment,and all trash from fire containment <br />

Virtual Community Meeting this evening at 5:00 – Facebook Live<br />
<br />
General Updates: The Cougar Peak Fire is burning approximately 15 miles northwest of Lakeview. After <br />
significant fire activity yesterday along the northeast perimeter, the wetting rains over the fire early this <br />
morning considerably moderated fire behavior. <br />
<br />
Today will be a favorable day for firefighters, as the rain has cooled the fire’s edge and will allow for <br />
more direct operations along the perimeter. An infrared reconnaissance flight last night provided a more <br />
accurate fire acreage. <br />
<br />
Yesterday began with extreme fire behavior, including a pyro-cumulonimbus development pushing out <br />
10-11 miles along the northern boundary of the fire. Firefighters focused efforts to keep ahead of the <br />
fire to provide structure and property protection. Contingency lines were constructed at the northeast <br />
side to provide structure protection to Valley Falls. At dark, when the winds dropped, the fire reached <br />
the flats just south of the Chewaucan Marsh and checked the forward movement. There was very little <br />
lateral growth on the east and west flanks of the fire due to the growth being wind driven. <br />
<br />
Dozer line work continues on the southern edge in efforts to create an anchor point for resources. <br />
Today, crews will focus work on eastern flank of the fire. The precipitation received will allow dozers and <br />
handcrews to use a direct tactic and build containment line next to the fire’s edge.<br />
<br />
The Oregon State Fire Marshal’s mobilized additional incident management staff and four more <br />
taskforces yesterday, bringing the total of structural protection taskforces to ten.Structural firefighters will <br />
capitalize on morning precipitation to access areas of the fire that were previously inaccessible due to active fire <br />
behavior. Focuses for today will be evaluating and protecting structures and engaging directly with fire lines that <br />
threatened homes.<br />
<br />
Behavior: Anticipated fire spread will be minimal today, due to the moderate weather. As the <br />
temperatures ease back into seasonal norms, fire behavior will likely increase over the weekend. <br />
<br />
Weather: The Red Flag Warning remains in effect through 5 p.m. today, for strong, gusty winds with low <br />
relative humidity and abundant lightning on dry fuels. Later today, the focus for showers and <br />
thunderstorms shifts northeast with dry conditions returning tonight and lasting into next week. The <br />
maximum temperature forecasted for today will be in the upper 60s. Southwest winds 3-6 mph with <br />
gusts up to 10 mph will become westerly 4-7 mph with gusts up to 12 mph in the afternoon. Erratic and <br />
gusty winds up to 20 mph can be expected near thunderstorms. <br />
<br />
Evacuations: Multiple Evacuation Levels have been issued by the Lake County Sheriff’s Office. See this link for <br />
entering a specific address in the upper right corner in this interactive <br />
map:https://geo.maps.arcgis.com/apps/PublicInformation/index.html appid=f8a0d8814a67445a9e6bf3485f4fd24f  <br />
See the website and Facebook for a full description of the evacuation levels. Link is below. <br />
https://www.lakecountyor.org/index.php https://www.facebook.com/Lake-County-Oregon104435824529906 <br />
<br />
Temporary Flight Restrictions: A Temporary Flight Restriction is in place over the Cougar Peak Fire. Please <br />
consult the Notice to Airman for specifics. Wildfires are a No Drone Zone. If you fly, we can’t. Whenever a drone <br />
is spotted near the fire, all aircraft are grounded until we can be sure the drone is clear of the area. For more <br />
information, visit http://knowbeforeyoufly.org.<br />
<br />
Despite the recent rain received, extremely dry fuel conditions and seasonal winds can make even a <br />
small spark rapidly grow into a large wildlife. These fires can be very destructive. For the latest restrictions and <br />
regulations, including ODF and federal agencies, visit https://scofmp.org/restrictions.shtml. Make sure to Know <br />

<br />
Special Notes:<br />
Beginning today, approximately 10 miles of the Rough Patch Complex and Jack Fire perimeters are part of <br />
the Devil’s Knob Complex, under the management of the Rocky Mountain Type I Incident Management <br />
Team (IMT). The change in management was made because of improved firefighter access from the west side, <br />
and close proximity between fires. The decision reduces risk to firefighters as most of the area between fires is <br />
inaccessible due to steep slopes, heavy fuel loading, and standing dead trees. <br />
<br />
Current Situation:<br />
Yesterday, fire activity diminished due to low temperatures and high humidity. Fire managers could secure fire <br />
perimeters, build direct fire line, and extinguish spot fires from several days ago. Resources worked on structure <br />
protection in Division B and indirect firelines in Divisions A and B. Rain last night was spotty and concentrated on <br />
the eastern edge of the fire. Today, weather conditions will subdue fire activity. Across most divisions, crews will <br />
be employing the same tactics from yesterday. Now that smoke has decreased, firefighters will be able to receive <br />
more assistance from aerial resources. Helicopters will conduct water drops, which will assist firefighters on the <br />
ground by cooling hotspots and making mop up easier.<br />
<br />
Smith Fire<br />
Acreage: 43,226 | Containment: 14%<br />
In Division F, firefighters will expand the depth of the fireline through firing operations if fuels will carry fire. Other , <br />
firefighters will continue patrol and mop-up, including on the spots from earlier this week in Division G. <br />
Division A – Similar to Division G, firefighters will continue engaging with the spot fires to extinguish them. <br />
Indirect line construction will also be a focus.<br />
Branch II: Division B – Fuels along Highway 28 will be removed as firefighters plan for future firing operations. <br />
Firefighters will also extinguish spot fires and secure firelines around structures.<br />
Divisions C and E – Patrol and mop-up will be ongoing in both divisions with emphasis on ensuring “the finger” <br />
perimeter doesn’t expand. <br />
<br />
Big Hamlin Fire<br />
Acreage: 18,957 | Containment: 63%<br />
Branch III: Firefighters will ensure the spot fire from several days ago in Division J is fully secured. Patrol and <br />
mop-up will occur across all other firelines where heat is detected and suppression repair will occur on the <br />
extinguished sections of fireline.<br />
Divisions H – Firefighters continue to assess fire activity from Highway 29 and are prepared to conduct firing <br />
operations if needed. Over the last several days, the fire has been backing down to Jackson Creek and no <br />
change is anticipated today.<br />
<br />
Weather and Fuel Conditions:<br />
The overhead low pressure system will remain for most of the day, bringing cool temperatures, high humidity, <br />
and minimal winds. In the afternoon, clouds will move allowing for sunny conditions although the humidity will <br />
remain high and fire activity will be low. Typical mid-September weather patterns with prevail into the middle of <br />
next week, with the area in a Pacific flow pattern. During this time, winds will remain light and from west to east <br />
with the continuation of cool temperatures and high humidity. The result on fire behavior will range from minimal <br />
to no fire growth; although areas with heavy dead and down trees may experience some active fire. <br />
<br />
Evacuation Notices:<br />
The Ash Creek-South Umpqua Road were elevated to a Level 3: Go (Leave immediately). Dumont 2810 to <br />
Jackson Creek will remain at a Level 2: Be Set Evacuation Status. The interactive web map depicts evacuation <br />
areas and levels: https://dcor.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?<br />

<br />
Current Situation: Green Ridge Fire:<br />
Yesterday: Fire crept around as pockets along southern edge filled in and growth occurred southward. Short-<br />
range ground fire north of Hwy 85, which was caused by a single-tree torching, was quickly put in check by <br />
firefighters. Heat continued to pop up in the perimeter's corners. Firefighters continued to patrol the fire line, <br />
conduct mop-up activities, and search for hotspots throughout the fire perimeter.<br />
<br />
Today: A new fire start was reported at 5:30 AM, located west of Rose Campground. Fire fighters are supporting <br />
local resources in containing the 1-acre fire. The cause is currently undetermined. Additionally, firefighters will <br />
continue to focus on SW and SE areas of the fire. Firefighters continue assessments further out and monitor and <br />
observe remote areas of southern perimeter. Crews will also continue to hold and improve completed lines to the <br />
west and continue to hold and improve completed lines to the south. As appropriate, personnel will provide <br />
continued point protection of assets and resources.<br />
<br />
Weather & Smoke Information:<br />
Showers, with thunderstorms also possible after 5:00 PM. Widespread haze. Areas of smoke before 11:00 AM. <br />
High near 72. Breezy, with an east wind 5-10 mph becoming southwest 18-23 mph in the morning. Winds could <br />
gust as high as 37 mph. Chance of precipitation is 80 percent. New rainfall amounts between a tenth and quarter <br />
of an inch, except higher amounts possible in thunderstorms. Smoke information is available on Washington <br />
Smoke Blog at: https://wasmoke.blogspot.com/<br />
<br />
Forest Closures:<br />
Umatilla National Forest officials reopened most National Forest lands within the Lick Creek Fire footprint <br />
September 9, 2021. Additionally, access will be reopened into portions of the Tucannon River drainage. The <br />
modified closure prohibits access on the Pomeroy Ranger District to some roads and trails within the Lick Creek <br />
Fire burned area, National Forest lands surrounding the Green Ridge Fire, and lands surrounding the Elbow <br />
Creek Fire on the Walla Walla Ranger District.  <br />
<br />
Closure orders can be found at: https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/umatilla/alerts-notices/?cid=stelprdb5286768<br />
<br />
Evacuations:<br />
Level-1 evacuations (be ready, stay aware) remain in place in Garfield, Columbia and Asotin counties. For more <br />
information on evacuations, please visit your local county government web pages for full information.<br />
<br />
Temporary Flight Restrictions:<br />
For the safety of the firefighters and aircraft fighting the Green Ridge Fire, a 10-nautical mile Temporary Flight <br />
Restriction (TFR) is in place over the fire area through September 15, 2021. This TFR has a 10,000-foot ceiling. <br />
Wildfires are a “No Drone Zone.” Whenever a drone is spotted near the fire all aircraft are grounded until we can <br />
be sure the drone is clear of the area. For more information, visit http://knowbeforeyoufly.org.</span>

<br />
Incident Summary:  The Great Basin Incident Management Team 2 took command of the Rough Patch Complex <br />
and Jack Fires at 6:00 a.m. Both fires are being managed under a full suppression strategy using containment <br />
and confinement tactics to minimize fire spread to prevent loss of valuable resources.  Objectives include <br />
keeping the fires as small as possible while working toward full containment.<br />
<br />
Weather in the area is forecast to be cooler and more humid. Some precipitation was received across the fire <br />
Thursday night, with .10 to .30 inches of rain received in some locations.  It is predicted to remain at these <br />
seasonably lower temperatures for the next few days. Weather conditions east of the Cascades could bring more <br />
humidity and cloud cover to the fire area, perhaps even some drizzle on Friday. These changes reflect the typical <br />
patterns for this time of year and may have the potential to diminish fire activity, especially if prolonged over <br />
several days.<br />
<br />
Chaos and Little Bend Fires:  The Chaos fire is at 24,462 acres and the Little Bend Creek Fire is at 8,569 acres.  <br />
On the north end of the Chaos Fire, firefighters assessed the spot fire that crossed the 2460 road.   It is currently <br />
burning at approximately three acres. With the very steep and rugged landscape in mind, crews have identified <br />
specific terrain features they are using in efforts to contain the spot and minimize its growth. Helicopters continue <br />
to support this priority with water drops and reconnaissance flights. On the southeast section of the Little Bend <br />
Creek Fire, crews are utilizing the 3816 road as a primary control line after the fire crossed over a section of the <br />
3850 road on Tuesday.<br />
<br />
Jack and Buckhead Fires:  The Jack Fire is at 23,990 acres and the Buckhead fire is at 6,536 acres.  The Jack <br />
Fire is contained along the west, north, and northeast perimeter. The fire has not grown for several days.  Fire <br />
crews are assessing the eastern edge for direct control operations. Firefighters are focusing on the southwest <br />
corner of the Buckhead Fire near the 100 road where they have contained small spot fires that resulted also <br />
during Tuesday’s wind event.  Due to the proximity of the Smith Fire, which is part of the Devil’s Knob Complex, <br />
close coordination is ongoing between the two Incident Management Teams managing each complex.<br />
<br />
<br />
Near Minky Fire:  The Near Minky Fire is at 4,867 acres.  This fire lays south of the Jack and Buckhead Fires.  <br />
The entire perimeter is contained except for the northwest corner, which is where it connects to the Buckhead <br />
Fire. Activity has been minimal for approximately two weeks.  <br />
<br />
Closures:  Copies of all closures and maps can be found at https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/closures/7758/.<br />
 ·       Amended BLM Roseburg District fire closure: BLM road 24-1-26 (Francis Creek) from the junction with <br />
BLM road 25-1E-31 (Canton Creek Road) North to the Roseburg District Boundary in Township 24 South Range <br />
1 West Section 1 will remain closed.<br />
 ·       The Umpqua and Willamette National Forests have temporarily closed areas of both forests due to the <br />
Jack Fire, Rough Patch Complex Fire, and Devil's Knob Complex Fire.<br />
 ·       Highway 138 between Roseburg and Diamond remains open. Expect short delays for hazard tree removal <br />
operations east of Glide. Slow down and be alert.</span>

Westfir, OR – Contingency lines around the southwest fire perimeter have been completed and an unmanned <br />
aircraft system &#40;UAS&#41; will be utilized to provide firefighters with aerial Infrared cameras to detect previously <br />
unknown hot spots that have been hidden by the smoke. UAS’s provide support in areas that are difficult to <br />
safely reach due to hazardous conditions. When weather conditions permit, UAS’s can provide aerial ignition, <br />
allowing wildland firefighters to reduce large bodies of unburned fuel within the containment lines in manageable <br />
portions, reducing fuel availability for wildfire advancement.<br />
<br />
Due to high humidity and low temperatures, burning operations will likely not be utilized today and crews will <br />
continue to focus on preparing the primary and secondary containment lines. Vegetation along the south fire <br />
perimeter has been cleared and is ready for those operations to begin, once conditions are optimal.<br />
<br />
Interior spot fires are predominately on south facing slopes in Nehi Creek, Purdue Creek towards Christy Creek, <br />
and south toward Evangeline Creek. Fire growth rate is anticipated to decrease over the next few days.  <br />
<br />
Weather: A marine push brought in clouds, light precipitation, and cooler temperatures overnight and is expected <br />
to remain through the weekend. Light terrain driven winds will continue out of the west/northwest this afternoon. <br />
Light showers are expected to continue until late afternoon with a thunderstorm expected at noon.<br />
<br />
Smoke: A marine west/northwest wind has given some relief from the smoke today. ‘Good’ air quality is expected <br />
for most of the day, moving into ‘Moderate’ in the afternoon.<br />
<br />
Safety:  Creating a defensible space can improve your home’s chance of surviving a wildfire.  Proper defensible <br />
spaces can also aid firefighters in their suppression efforts. Visit https://www.readyforwildfire.org/prepare-for-<br />
wildfire/get-ready/defensible-space/ to learn more.<br />
<br />
Closures: Please recreate responsibly! As hunting season nears, be sure to check the area for potential fire <br />
closures. Visit https://www.fs.usda.gov/alerts/willamette/alerts-notices for the latest updates.</span>

Conconully, WA: Firefighters will continue their main efforts on the Charlie Division which is on the northeast and <br />
northwest portion of the fire. There is approximately 200 acres of active fire that they will go direct and indirect <br />
with fire suppression. There is still some mop up and repair work on division Xray which is the eastern portion of <br />
the fire. Division Foxtrot which is the southern and western division of the fire is primarily in patrol status. Repair <br />
work is being done on areas of the fire that need cleaning up such as: fence repairs, road repairs, logging snags, <br />
dozer line and handlines. Much of the same efforts on the repair side will continue for the next several days.  <br />
Infrared flights are being done each night to look for hot spots. This technology shows the firefighters specific <br />
areas to focus on and confirms their previous efforts were successful. Crews will continue securing indirect fire <br />
line, and mopping up 150 feet in from the perimeter.    <br />
<br />
The weather system that came through yesterday morning produced minimal amounts of rain. The winds were <br />
not significant which helped with firefighter efforts. Today’s weather is expected to be in the 70s with minimum <br />
humidity at 30%. Winds will be south to southwest 1-4 mph in the morning and becoming 6-12 mph in the <br />
afternoon with gusts along the ridgelines up to 15 mph.  <br />
<br />
 Road closures remain in effect and are being evaluated on a daily basis. The main reason for the closures is for <br />
firefighter safety and the safety of citizens. Please adhere to the closures. There are several areas that are only <br />
one lane and citizen traffic will not be able to get around the large machinery. If you are in the area and come <br />
across a road closed sign do not go around that sign. There are several hazards that have been created from the <br />
fire and everyone’s safety is our priority.  <br />
<br />
· FS Road 37 is closed at the junction with FS Road 42 <br />
· FS Road 38 is closed at the forest boundary north of Conconully<br />
· Mineral Hill Road is closed just west of Conconully <br />
<br />
There are no evacuation orders in place at this time. <br />

The Muckamuck Fire started by lightning on Saturday August 4, 2021. The fire is located in and around the Town <br />
of Conconully, Washington. Mixed conifer with dead and downed materials are the primary fuel source along with <br />
ponderosa pine, sagebrush, and cured grass meadows. The fire is estimated at 13,314 (this could change with <br />
more accurate mapping) and is now 75% contained. During the first phase of the fire there were 4 primary and 3 <br />
secondary structures lost. <br />
<br />
Did you know? When a wildfire breaks out and exceeds the capabilities of local and mutual aid agencies an <br />
Incident Management Team (IMT) is requested. This happens when the size, complexity, and duration of the <br />
incident cannot be handled by the local agency. There are Type 1,2 & 3 teams with 10 to 100+ members. This <br />
allows for initial attack crews to get back to their jurisdiction and get ready for the next call. Transitioning to an <br />
IMT has many benefits. One of the biggest is the access to additional resources from almost anywhere in the <br />
US. The IMT is self-contained throughout the incident. Make sure to read tomorrows brief for more information on <br />
the benefits of Incident Management Teams and how they operate.   <br />
<br />
Fire information and the incident command post is located at Omak Stampede Grounds in Omak, WA. Fire <br />
information contact is Don Malone at (509) 822-8125 or you can also follow us on Facebook @NEWIMT3</span>

Incident Summary:  The Great Basin Incident Management Team 2 took command of the Rough Patch Complex <br />
and Jack Fires at 6:00 a.m. Both fires are being managed under a full suppression strategy using containment <br />
and confinement tactics to minimize fire spread to prevent loss of valuable resources.  Objectives include <br />
keeping the fires as small as possible while working toward full containment.<br />
<br />
Weather in the area is forecast to be cooler and more humid. Some precipitation was received across the fire <br />
Thursday night, with .10 to .30 inches of rain received in some locations.  It is predicted to remain at these <br />
seasonably lower temperatures for the next few days. Weather conditions east of the Cascades could bring more <br />
humidity and cloud cover to the fire area, perhaps even some drizzle on Friday. These changes reflect the typical <br />
patterns for this time of year and may have the potential to diminish fire activity, especially if prolonged over <br />
several days.<br />
<br />
Chaos and Little Bend Fires:  The Chaos fire is at 24,462 acres and the Little Bend Creek Fire is at 8,569 acres.  <br />
On the north end of the Chaos Fire, firefighters assessed the spot fire that crossed the 2460 road.   It is currently <br />
burning at approximately three acres. With the very steep and rugged landscape in mind, crews have identified <br />
specific terrain features they are using in efforts to contain the spot and minimize its growth. Helicopters continue <br />
to support this priority with water drops and reconnaissance flights. On the southeast section of the Little Bend <br />
Creek Fire, crews are utilizing the 3816 road as a primary control line after the fire crossed over a section of the <br />
3850 road on Tuesday.<br />
<br />
Jack and Buckhead Fires:  The Jack Fire is at 23,990 acres and the Buckhead fire is at 6,536 acres.  The Jack <br />
Fire is contained along the west, north, and northeast perimeter. The fire has not grown for several days.  Fire <br />
crews are assessing the eastern edge for direct control operations. Firefighters are focusing on the southwest <br />
corner of the Buckhead Fire near the 100 road where they have contained small spot fires that resulted also <br />
during Tuesday’s wind event.  Due to the proximity of the Smith Fire, which is part of the Devil’s Knob Complex, <br />
close coordination is ongoing between the two Incident Management Teams managing each complex.<br />
<br />
<br />
Near Minky Fire: The Near Minky Fire is at 4,867 acres.  This fire lays south of the Jack and Buckhead Fires.  <br />
The entire perimeter is contained except for the northwest corner, which is where it connects to the Buckhead <br />
Fire. Activity has been minimal for approximately two weeks.  <br />
<br />
Closures:  Copies of all closures and maps can be found at https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/closures/7758/.<br />
 ·       Amended BLM Roseburg District fire closure: BLM road 24-1-26 (Francis Creek) from the junction with <br />
BLM road 25-1E-31 (Canton Creek Road) North to the Roseburg District Boundary in Township 24 South Range <br />
1 West Section 1 will remain closed.<br />
 ·       The Umpqua and Willamette National Forests have temporarily closed areas of both forests due to the <br />
Jack Fire, Rough Patch Complex Fire, and Devil's Knob Complex Fire.<br />
 ·       Highway 138 between Roseburg and Diamond remains open. Expect short delays for hazard tree removal <br />
operations east of Glide. Slow down and be alert.</span>

<br />
Fire progression continued steadily along the northern edges of the fire as expected. The fire was primarily <br />
backing and flanking to the north, but did make short uphill runs through receptive fuels. Crews focused on <br />
structure protection efforts to protect cabins along the Highway 410 corridor, should the fire become established <br />
on the west side of American Ridge. On the western flank of the fire, crews used hand ignitions supported by <br />
aerial bucket work to secure critical holding points north of Goose Prairie in the Bumping River corridor. <br />
Mechanical work proceeded along Forest Road (FR) 1706 and 1709 to provide a secure firing line to conduct <br />
burnout operations and protect structures in the Lost Creek area. Firefighters successfully directed fire out of the <br />
Lost Creek drainage up to Edgar Rock and are continuing to hold it with the help of natural features. A wildland <br />
use module improved control features and completed firing operations along the trail to Burnt Mountain in the <br />
William O. Douglas Wilderness.<br />
<br />
Today: Areas around the fire are expected to see more moderate fire weather conditions, with increased cloud <br />
cover and a chance of light precipitation. The fire is expected to continue to make short runs uphill as it finds <br />
receptive fuels. Several Type 1 crews are expected to arrive from Canada to assist operations in priority areas. <br />
Firefighters will continue their focus on FR 1706 and 1709 to establish a good perimeter and provide protection <br />
for the Naches River corridor. The wildland use module will continue firing operations from Burnt Mountain to <br />
Shellrock Peak along the trail system in the William O. Douglas Wilderness to divert and direct fire into ideal <br />
terrain. Northwest Team 10 will shadow Pacific North-west Team 2 as they prepare to assume command of the <br />
Schneider Springs Fire on Saturday, September 11 at 6:00 a.m.<br />

<br />
Highlights: Yesterday’s weather provided favorable conditions for burning operations to occur across the <br />
northwest and northeast sides of the fire, along with the area around Lynx Mountain. Firefighters successfully <br />
incorporated aerial ignitions into their operations to encourage interior burning in several key areas around the <br />
perimeter. A few small spot fires ignited from burning trees falling across the road on the eastern flank, although <br />
these spots were quickly contained and mopped up. Fire activity is expected to be minimal today due to incoming <br />
rain, higher humidity, increased cloud cover, and lighter winds. <br />
<br />
Operations: On the west side, crews applied fire starting from control lines moving northeast toward <br />
Seventeenmile Road, while a second group of firefighters started ignitions along Hall Creek Road heading west. <br />
These strategic burning operations have provided 400-500 feet of depth in this area, increasing protection <br />
against future fire spread to the north. If conditions allow, crews will attempt to burn out the remaining ¾-mile <br />
stretch needed to join the open fire line. Previous spot fires that spread near Bear Springs have been secured <br />
and lined with a dozer to stop further movement. Crews continue to monitor and respond to isolated hot spots <br />
near Brush Mountain, although none have threatened to break through existing containment lines. In addition to <br />
conducting aerial ignitions, helicopters are also supporting ground resources by dropping water to cool areas that <br />
show increased fire activity. With the anticipated smoke and cloud cover, flying opportunities may be more limited <br />
today. The southwest and southeast portions of the fire will continue to be monitored by aircraft. <br />
<br />
Weather: A weather system will move across Oregon and eastern Washington today, bringing extensive cloud <br />
cover along with some light rain showers. The first showers should reach the fire by early afternoon with showers <br />
becoming more numerous during the late afternoon and evening hours. The rain will exit the region early <br />
Saturday morning. Total rainfall amounts will average between 0.1 and 0.25 inches. At this time, no lighting is <br />
expected, but there is always a possibility for a few strikes. The cloud cover and precipitation will keep <br />
temperatures down and humidity up throughout the night. <br />
<br />
Safety: The health and safety of firefighters and the public is the first priority. The public is strongly encouraged to <br />
stay safely clear of the active fire area. Firefighters are conducting operations under protocols to mitigate the risk <br />
of COVID-19. <br />
<br />
Smoke: Smoke from the Summit Trail Fire, along with other fires in the region, may be visible in the area <br />
surrounding Inchelium. An interactive smoke map at https://wasmoke.blogspot.com/ allows you to zoom into your <br />
location to see the latest smoke information. Smoke-sensitive individuals and people with respiratory problems or <br />
heart disease are encouraged to take precautionary measures. <br />

<br />
Yesterday:  Firefighters were able to take advantage of favorable conditions yesterday afternoon by continuing <br />
hand firing and aerial ignitions in the Stormy Mountain area. The primary objective of these burnout operations is <br />
to secure a line around the fire and limit the footprint of the fire to the area within that line. Air resources dropped <br />
retardant in strategic locations to “pre-treat” along the containment line in advance of firing operations. Further <br />
east and north, firefighters continued patrolling, mopping up, and securing the line where burnout operations <br />
were completed several days ago.<br />
<br />
Today: As conditions allow, firefighters will continue burning operations to reinforce the containment line along <br />
the Devil’s Backbone northwest of Stormy Mountain. These firing operations are expected to continue for several <br />
days as they work northward along the Devils Backbone to near the Pot Peak and Devil’s Backbone Trail <br />
junction just south of Angle Peak. Firefighters will be burning out in strategic locations, removing vegetation <br />
between the containment line and the fire edge. This effectively reduces fire intensity before it reaches the <br />
containment lines, thereby reducing the potential for the fire spotting across containment lines. Firefighters will <br />
also be patrolling and mopping up where burnout operations were previously completed and structure protection <br />
crews will continue working in the Lake Chelan corridor south of Hollywood Beach, monitoring and maintaining <br />
the network of hoses, pumps, and other equipment placed in previous weeks. Road work is ongoing where <br />
needed to ensure safe access to the fire area for fire personnel.<br />
<br />
Community Meeting: A recording of yesterday’s virtual community meeting for the Twenty-five Mile Fire can be <br />
viewed on Facebook(facebook.com/25MileFire2021) or the Twenty-five Mile Fire You Tube channel: <br />
https://youtu.be/mX6R8CijUV0.<br />
<br />
Weather and Fire Behavior: Today will be mostly cloudy and there is a chance of light precipitation over the fire <br />
area, however this is not expected to be a wetting rain. A trend towards cooler temperatures with higher humidity <br />
will continue into the weekend. There is potential for hazy and smoky conditions in valley bottoms and along <br />
Lake Chelan and the Columbia River if burnout operations resume today.</span>

<br />
Moderating temperatures, along with heavy cloud cover reduced fire behavior along the northwest side of the fire <br />
yesterday.  The fire grew about 217 acres.  The fire has been predominately backing in heavy fuels, with single <br />
torching being observed. <br />
<br />
Heavy fuels, steep terrain and rocky cliffs create a severe hazard for wildland firefighters to create direct line on <br />
the fire. Crews have been prepping the USFS 125 and 130 roads as indirect fire line.  Further evaluation is being <br />
considered on creating indirect line between the northern and southern flanks of the fire.  Aerial support is <br />
assigned to the fire and will be available to slow progress of the fire as backs down to the fire line, if needed. <br />
<br />
Fire behavior increased into the night as a thermal belt established at around the 5,000 foot line.  An infrared <br />
flight has been flown last night to determine the additional growth.<br />
<br />
Crews will be evaluating potential burn out operations from this morning into the early afternoon, prior to the <br />
expected rainfall.  If this occurs, expect increasing visible smoke along the northwest flank of Bonaparte <br />
Mountain.<br />
<br />
Today, there is expected to be increasing clouds, cooling temperatures and higher relative humidity with a <br />
chance of precipitation.  This combination typically reduces overall fire behavior. Smoke will still be readily visible <br />
along the northwest flanks of Bonaparte Mountain.  Fuels will continue to burn and produce minor smoke in the <br />
remaining areas of the fire.<br />
<br />
Road closures and evacuations remain in place.</span>
