Road Closures: <br />
<br />
The Washington Department of Transportation’s (WSDOT) geotechnical team was on site along the Highway 2 corridor felling fire weakened trees and clearing debris throughout the day.  The <br />
assessment has been completed and they currently plan to open Highway 2 on Monday. Please check https://wsdot.com/travel/real-time/alerts/road/002  for the most current information.   <br />
<br />
Impacts are ongoing in communities adjacent to the fire. Highway 2 remains closed just east of Index Galena Road near Sunset Falls (MP 36), to the junction of 5th St. N into the town of Skykomish <br />
(MP 49). Local highway access is permitted for residents with identification from the west closure at Index-Galena Road to the Money Creek tunnel.  Highway 2 from the west end of Money Creek Tunel <br />
to 5th Street in Skykomish will remain closed to all.   <br />
<br />
We ask residents to please stay close to their own property and be mindful of the fire crews working along the highway. Please follow posted speed limits. <br />
<br />
Update: <br />
<br />
As anticipated, weather conditions led to increased fire activity on Wednesday. On the south side of the fire flames and smoke could be seen. These spot fires were started by roll outs, however the fire <br />
moved upslope and back to the main body of the fire. The spot fires remain within the containment lines and firefighters are closely monitoring. Due to the increased activity, night crews will be <br />
monitoring and patrolling for the next several days.    <br />
<br />
Today’s weather will be mostly sunny with light winds west 5-10 MPH. Relative humidity's will remain in the mid 50’s with maximum temps around 65 degrees. <br />
<br />
Smoke: Increased smoke production is anticipated. Current information on air quality may be found at Washington Smoke Blog at https://wasmoke.blogspot.com/ <br />
 <br />
Evacuation Levels: Current Evacuation levels:   <br />
<br />
Level 1 (Ready): Index – continues. <br />
No other evacuation guidance for occupied areas of Snohomish County. <br />
Level 2 (Set): Baring and Grotto and area along U.S. 2 east to the Money Creek tunnel. Continues.  <br />
Level 3 (Go): From west side of Money Creek tunnel to milepost 48, plus FS Road 65 (Beckler River Road). <br />
Skykomish remains at Level 1 (Ready). <br />
<br />

CUSICK, Wash. –The cold front moving into the fire area will potentially bring sustained winds and a 10% probability of wetting rain.  <br />
Wetting rain is widespread showers that over an extended period of time significantly reduce fire danger.  One tenth of an inch may be <br />
sufficient to decrease fire danger in grass and up to one half inch may be necessary for timber.<br />
<br />
In order to reduce and mitigate landslides, firefighters utilize water bars to prevent water drainage that would follow topography <br />
established in sloped dozer lines.  Heavy equipment with capabilities of working on steep slopes are used to rehabilitate the fire line <br />
where equipment was used to create a fire break.  Natural vegetation is scattered on top of water bars and fire lines to slow the <br />
movement of rainwater to reduce the probability of sluffing of debris.  Firefighters assist in areas where equipment is unable to navigate.<br />
<br />
Utilizing equipment and firefighters to revert the environment to normal conditions due to suppression activities and prevent soil erosion <br />
is an essential component of wildland fire management.  Returning the forest to its natural habitat will maintain recreational activities <br />
including hunting, hiking and camping as well as reducing the probability of future adverse impacts.<br />
<br />
Safety: Safety of firefighters and members of the public are our first priority.  All hunters are encouraged to become familiarized with the <br />
USFS closure area, don personal protective equipment and practice safe hunting practices as forest grouse season gets under way.<br />
<br />
Closures: An area closure remains in place for the Boulder Mountain Fire on the Colville National Forest. For a map and complete <br />
description of the closure area, including a list of trails and roads, go to https://www.fs.usda.gov/alerts/colville/alerts-notices.</span>

Status: The fire is 11% contained, with containment line on the west side of the fire between Forest Service Road 24 and Fifth Creek, <br />
the stretch from Charlton Lake west to the shore of Waldo Lake, and the north and west shores of Waldo Lake. Oakridge and <br />
communities west of the fire will experience the most smoke as southeast winds continue today. <br />
<br />
The West Zone of the fire is currently burning with low intensity creeping, and smoldering. Fire spread is occurring in areas with deep, <br />
dry litter and heavy fuels. The East Zone is experiencing fire behavior including creeping, smoldering, and single-tree torching. Fire <br />
growth is minimal. Sheltered heat may reemerge after the rain if fuels continue to be dry enough. <br />
<br />
West Zone Operations:  Heavy smoke and fog lingered through much of the fire area on Monday morning. This inhibited fire growth <br />
during the day but also limited firing operations in the morning. Along the south and southwestern edges, firefighters were able to make <br />
progress on firing operations along Forest Service Road 5871 and near Eagle Creek. Visibility cleared enough by afternoon for aerial <br />
ignitions by helicopter near Kwiskwis Butte. These operations reduce fuels between the fireline and the main fire. Crews continued <br />
mopping up along Forest Service Road 2409 and Forest Service Road 1928 where previous firing operations occurred on the western <br />
edge of the fire. <br />
<br />
As the wetter weather comes into the fire area, firefighter and public safety remains top priority. After steep terrain has burned, rocks <br />
once held in place by root systems or vegetation loosen and pose a hazard to firefighters. Dead or fire weakened trees (snags) can fall, <br />
compromising the fireline and presenting a risk to firefighters. Firefighters will continue cutting snags and extinguishing hot spots to <br />
secure the fire line where previous burning operations occurred. If the weather clears and conditions allow, crews are poised to take <br />
advantage of windows of opportunity for continued burning operations.    <br />
<br />
East Zone Operations: Hotshot crews are wrapping up their work on the fireline and containment line along Forest Service Road 4290. <br />
Charlton Lake west to Waldo Lake has been contained and the east side of Charlton Lake to the Cascade Lakes Highway is being <br />
improved as a fire break. On the east side of Waldo Lake, crews have completed 6 miles of fuel break, 75 feet deep, along Forest <br />
Service Road 5896 and Forest Service Road 5897 from Charlton Lake to Highway 58. More than 170 structures have been prepped on <br />
the north side of Odell Lake and near Crescent Junction, and some engines will be released today. Most of the protection work has <br />
been completed in campgrounds. <br />
<br />
Crews continue work to join Forest Service Road 4668 and Forest Service Road 4660 to create a break between Odell Lake, Davis <br />
Lake, and the Cascade Lakes Highway. Between Little Cultus Lake and Deer Lake, crews are brushing, chipping, and removing snags <br />
along Forest Service Road 640 to protect Cultus Mountain from future fire advancement. Final clean up is happening on the Forest <br />
Service Road 700 fuel break connecting Little Cultus Lake and the Cascade Lakes Highway. Heavy equipment including feller <br />
bunchers, masticators, and hydro axes continue work along the Cascade Lakes highway building a shaded fuel break 100 feet wide. <br />
This improvement not only protects values at risk from the Cedar Creek fire, but it will remain a valuable tool for managing fire in the <br />
future.</span>

Public Meeting – Friday, September 23rd at 6:00 PM at Joseph Community Event Center and streamed via Facebook Live <br />
<br />
Highlights: The Wallowa-Whitman National Forest updated their road, trail and area closures and their public use restrictions today. The road, trail and area closers took effect on September <br />
21, 2022 and the specifics can be found on the Double Creek Fire Facebook page. The public use restrictions, sometimes referred to as fire restrictions, will be reduced from Phase B to <br />
Phase A. Those changes are set to take effect on Friday, September 23rd at 12:01 a.m. Pacific Time and are also posted to the Double Creek Fire Facebook page.  <br />
<br />
Double Creek Fire: 157,320 acres | 58% contained | 579 personnel assigned  <br />
<br />
The fire grew twenty-four acres in the last twenty-four hours. The Incident Commander flew over the northern portion of the fire yesterday and observed isolated pockets of fire burning in grass <br />
and downed logs. Crews are monitoring this area to see what impact today’s precipitation will have on fire activity. A dozer line is being constructed on the southern edge of the fire to tie <br />
existing fireline into the road system. The entire western edge of the fire is now contained.   <br />
<br />
Eagle Cap Wilderness Fires  <br />
<br />
The Nebo, Sturgill, and Goat Mountain 2 Fires were lightning-caused and are being managed to protect public and private infrastructure while playing a natural role within designated <br />
Wilderness. Progress on managed fires is expressed through the accomplishment of ecological and fuel reduction objectives as opposed to progress on full suppression fires, which is <br />
expressed through containment. <br />
<br />
Nebo Fire: 12,600 acres | 50% of management objectives achieved | 54 personnel assigned <br />
<br />
The fire grew one acre in the last twenty-four hours. Equipment on FSR 3920-50 is chipping trees, slash, and brush. While the direct impact of this fuel reduction work is to slow the progress of <br />
the Nebo fire should conditions change and fire activity increase, this will also provide long-term benefits for forest health and improved wildlife habitat. Crews will monitor the fire and mop any <br />
hot spots discovered. <br />
<br />
Sturgill Fire: 20,192 acres | 53% of management objectives achieved | 64 personnel assigned <br />
<br />
The fire grew thirty-four acres in the last twenty-four hours. Fire suppression repair continues to be the main mission today. Trucks are hauling trees cut outside of the wilderness to staging <br />
areas where they will be sold and then taken to a mill for processing. Excavators and masticators are chipping brush and debris. Those chips then play a vital role in recycling nutrients back <br />
into the soil. Pumps, hoses, and other equipment used during fire suppression are being transported back to the main incident camp for rehab.  <br />
<br />
Goat Mountain 2 Fire: 536 acres | 0 personnel assigned <br />
<br />
The Goat Mountain 2 Fire exhibited zero growth in the last twenty-four hours. Aircraft will continue to monitor the fire as smoke and weather permit.</span>

Overview: The Goat Rocks Fire continues to burn 1.5 miles northeast of the town of Packwood, Washington in and around the Goat <br />
Rocks Wilderness. Firefighters have finished removing fuels around structures closest to the fire and are patrolling those <br />
neighborhoods.   Although the fire had moderate growth, yesterday’s successful burning operation further strengthened control lines <br />
between the fire’s edge and highly-valued resources.  As of this morning the fire is being held at the 4610 Road, about ½ mile from <br />
Upper Timberline. Fire managers are prioritizing firefighter and public safety as they continue to make good progress toward completing <br />
firefighting objectives; today, 85% of indirect control lines have been completed.   <br />
<br />
Firefighting Activity: Yesterday, conditions were favorable for the burning operation that had to be paused on Tuesday due to potentially <br />
unstable weather and winds. Firefighters carefully applied fire to clear vegetation further reinforcing fire breaks by removing fuels <br />
between the fire’s edge and control lines at the 4610 and 4612 Roads in and around the Coal Creek drainage. On the fire’s northwest <br />
corner near Bluff Lake, fire behavior was more active due to windy, warm and dry conditions. Fire managers monitored additional hot <br />
spots around Dam Creek and in the Lava Creek area; helicopters applied water to slow the fire. In addition, crews finished clearing a <br />
helicopter landing spot on the fire’s northern edge, providing more rapid access in the event of a field emergency.  Firefighters have <br />
finished work in the Timberline and Goat Rocks communities but are leaving fire protection equipment – hose lines and water tanks – in <br />
place as a contingency for firefighting efforts. Fire managers ask the public to leave the equipment where it is; crews will remove it <br />
when appropriate.  <br />
<br />
Today, a crew will be patrolling Timberline and Goat Rocks while the rest of the personnel previously working on structure protection will <br />
be reassigned to the fire’s western edges. There, firefighters will monitor the areas of yesterday’s burning operation. Work will continue <br />
strengthening control lines with heavy equipment on forest roads around the fire’s north and west perimeters. <br />
<br />
Weather: Cooler temperatures and rising humidity are forecast for Thursday and Friday as the weather shifts to an onshore pattern with <br />
light westerly winds until Sunday when warmer conditions and an easterly flow are expected.  <br />
<br />
Public Safety: This National Preparedness Month, we are reminding you to develop an emergency communications plan with your <br />
family. Decide now how you will check-in with one another if regular communications channels are unavailable. To learn more, visit: <br />

<br />
<br />
The percent of containment on a fire is one measure of progress, but not the only one. Completion of firefighting objectives is another <br />
measure of progress. These objectives include construction of control lines and protecting highly valued resources such as the <br />
Packwood community, sensitive tribal resources, and historic structures at Packwood Lake.  This deliberate and methodical strategy is <br />
designed to achieve these protection goals without subjecting firefighters to unacceptable risk.</span>

Plain, WA – Lightning started the White River and Irving Peak Fires on August 11th. The Minnow Ridge Fire cause is undetermined. <br />
These fires are burning on the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest.<br />
<br />
Suppression Strategy – Due to rugged and steep terrain, fire managers continue to implement a long-term strategy to manage these <br />
fires, including the use of primary and contingency perimeter lines for containment. Tactics include completion and reinforcement of fire <br />
lines utilizing forest roads and constructed hand line.<br />
<br />
Current Situation – A local Type 3 Incident Management Team assumed command of the fires on September 7th and is currently <br />
managing the White River, Irving Peak, Meander, and now Minnow Ridge fires. The Meander Fire remains at 6 acres with very minimal <br />
fire activity. Smoke may be visible over the next several weeks as interior fuels continue to smolder and burn out, and multiple fires burn <br />
region-wide. Updates will be posted weekly unless significant new activity occurs.<br />
<br />
White River Fire – Acres: 3,184 (as of 9/13/2022); 5% contained; Location: Sears Creek area of the White River drainage, <br />
approximately 14 miles NW of Plain, WA.<br />
The fire area remains drier and more active along the southern edges. The fire footprint remains within the control lines, and geographic <br />
features being utilized as containment lines. Firefighters are working to establish an anchor point and maintain the structure protection <br />
along Sears Creek Road and Windmill Lane.<br />
<br />
Irving Peak Fire – Acres: 3,226 (as of 9/9/2022); 5% contained; Location: Approximately 16 miles NW of Plain, WA<br />
The Irving Peak Fire received some precipitation yesterday with minimal growth and fire activity. Firefighters continue to improve roads <br />
used as containment lines and monitor fire activity.<br />
<br />
Minnow Ridge Fire – Acres: 502 (as of 9/13/2022); 0% contained; Location: Chikamin Ridge, approximately 14 miles N of Plain, WA.<br />
Fire activity has been moderate and mainly consuming ground fuels. Firefighters continue scouting forest roads and fire lines previously <br />
utilized during past wildfire activity to determine if they may benefit the current fire suppression strategy.  <br />
<br />
Weather – A chance of showers exists over the fire area today, Wednesday, September 14th, with west winds around 6-8 mph. Cooler <br />
temperatures and higher relative humidity continue into later this week.<br />
<br />
Air Quality and Smoke – Current information about air quality and health recommendations during smoky conditions is available on the <br />
Washington Smoke Blog https://wasmoke.blogspot.com/<br />
<br />
Closures – An emergency closure issued by the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest remains in place and can be viewed here: <br />
www.fs.usda.gov/alerts/okawen/alerts-notices. The PCT remains open and is not directly impacted by these fires. Several trails in the <br />
Chikamin Ridge area are pending closure due to the Minnow Ridge Fire. Fire managers are asking people to please respect these <br />
closures while recreating in the area.<br />
<br />
Restrictions – Campfires are not allowed anywhere within the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest. Stage 2 Restrictions are now in <br />
effect for the entire forest, including campgrounds and wilderness areas: www.fs.usda.gov/detail/okawen/alerts-notices/?<br />
cid=fsbdev3_053600.<br />
<br />
Evacuations – Current Chelan County evacuation levels include a Level 2 evacuation (Be Prepared) for Sears Creek Road and Level 1 <br />
(Stay Alert) for White River Road and Little Wenatchee Road. www.co.chelan.wa.us/emergency-management/pages/active-<br />

<br />
MERLIN, Ore. – A warming trend will begin today, as the low-pressure system that brought almost a half-inch of rain to the fire area <br />
begins to move east. Small vegetation gains moisture quickly, but it also loses moisture quickly. As the sun returns, along with warmer <br />
temperatures and lower humidity levels, pockets of unburned vegetation will once again be available to burn. An increase in smoke <br />
production is possible as temperatures move back into the 80’s this weekend.<br />
<br />
While larger fuels in the fire’s interior, such as logs and stumps, will continue to smolder until winter arrives, firefighters expect to <br />
complete mop up operations within the next week. When completed, fire personnel will have located and extinguished any remaining <br />
pockets of heat within 200-feet of containment lines.<br />
<br />
A Bureau of Land Management (BLM) Emergency Stabilization and Rehabilitation (ESR) team is being briefed today. This team will <br />
examine the burned area to identify locations in the forest that were impacted by high intensity fire. They will develop a plan to assist <br />
with revegetation, soil stabilization, and erosion control.<br />
<br />
Road Checkpoints: Road blocks are located at: Galice Rd north of Almeda; Peavine East Road at Bear Camp Road; Peavine West <br />
Road at Upper Bear Camp Road; Quartz Creek Road about 3 miles up (end of County maintenance); Hog Creek Road at Galice Road; <br />
and Galice Road at the bridge by Grave Creek Boat Ramp.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Recreation Area Openings: The Rogue River Trail (river right) is open, as is Almeda County Park. Rocky Bar, Robert Dean, Chair, and <br />
Rand Recreation sites remain closed at this time. The Rainie Falls National Recreation Trail (on river left) remains closed. The Grave <br />
Creek boat ramp is not accessible from Galice Road. Additional recreation sites are being assessed. Revised closure order and map: <br />
https://www.blm.gov/programs/public-safety-and-fire/fire-and-aviation/regional-info/oregon- washington/fire-restrictions.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
River status: The Wild section of the Rogue River below Grave Creek is open. The Smullin Visitor Center in Rand is now open for <br />
permits, and new permits are being issued. The recreation section of the Rogue River is open, however the Rand and Argo Boat <br />
Ramps are closed. Day users are recommended to take out at Almeda. Please call 541-471-6535 for more information.</span>

						    <span class="textarea">White River and Irving Peak Fire Update<br />
September 14, 2022<br />
<br />
Plain, WA – Lightning started the White River and Irving Peak Fires on August 11th. The Minnow Ridge Fire cause is undetermined. <br />
These fires are burning on the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest.<br />
<br />
Suppression Strategy – Due to rugged and steep terrain, fire managers continue to implement a long-term strategy to manage these <br />
fires, including the use of primary and contingency perimeter lines for containment. Tactics include completion and reinforcement of fire <br />
lines utilizing forest roads and constructed hand line.<br />
<br />
Current Situation – A local Type 3 Incident Management Team assumed command of the fires on September 7th and is currently <br />
managing the White River, Irving Peak, Meander, and now Minnow Ridge fires. The Meander Fire remains at 6 acres with very minimal <br />
fire activity. Smoke may be visible over the next several weeks as interior fuels continue to smolder and burn out, and multiple fires burn <br />
region-wide. Updates will be posted weekly unless significant new activity occurs.<br />
<br />
White River Fire – Acres: 3,184 (as of 9/13/2022); 5% contained; Location: Sears Creek area of the White River drainage, <br />
approximately 14 miles NW of Plain, WA.<br />
The fire area remains drier and more active along the southern edges. The fire footprint remains within the control lines, and geographic <br />
features being utilized as containment lines. Firefighters are working to establish an anchor point and maintain the structure protection <br />
along Sears Creek Road and Windmill Lane.<br />
<br />
Irving Peak Fire – Acres: 3,226 (as of 9/9/2022); 5% contained; Location: Approximately 16 miles NW of Plain, WA<br />
The Irving Peak Fire received some precipitation yesterday with minimal growth and fire activity. Firefighters continue to improve roads <br />
used as containment lines and monitor fire activity.<br />
<br />
Minnow Ridge Fire – Acres: 502 (as of 9/13/2022); 0% contained; Location: Chikamin Ridge, approximately 14 miles N of Plain, WA.<br />
Fire activity has been moderate and mainly consuming ground fuels. Firefighters continue scouting forest roads and fire lines previously <br />
utilized during past wildfire activity to determine if they may benefit the current fire suppression strategy.  <br />
<br />
Weather – A chance of showers exists over the fire area today, Wednesday, September 14th, with west winds around 6-8 mph. Cooler <br />
temperatures and higher relative humidity continue into later this week.<br />
<br />
Air Quality and Smoke – Current information about air quality and health recommendations during smoky conditions is available on the <br />
Washington Smoke Blog https://wasmoke.blogspot.com/<br />
<br />
Closures – An emergency closure issued by the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest remains in place and can be viewed here: <br />
www.fs.usda.gov/alerts/okawen/alerts-notices. The PCT remains open and is not directly impacted by these fires. Several trails in the <br />
Chikamin Ridge area are pending closure due to the Minnow Ridge Fire. Fire managers are asking people to please respect these <br />
closures while recreating in the area.<br />
<br />
Restrictions – Campfires are not allowed anywhere within the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest. Stage 2 Restrictions are now in <br />
effect for the entire forest, including campgrounds and wilderness areas: www.fs.usda.gov/detail/okawen/alerts-notices/?<br />
cid=fsbdev3_053600.<br />
<br />
Evacuations – Current Chelan County evacuation levels include a Level 2 evacuation (Be Prepared) for Sears Creek Road and Level 1 <br />
(Stay Alert) for White River Road and Little Wenatchee Road. www.co.chelan.wa.us/emergency-management/pages/active-<br />
