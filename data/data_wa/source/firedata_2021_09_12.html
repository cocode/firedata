Current Status: Yesterday, a small amount of rain fell over the fire area with 0.10” measured on the west side to <br />
0.30” measured on the east side. The cloudy and damp conditions kept fire activity subdued throughout the day. <br />
The overnight infrared flight could not fly due to cloud cover and weather so there is no change in reported fire <br />
size again today. The fire did continue to creep and smolder as it moved in the Upper Dickey Creek, Mother Lode <br />
Creek, and Battle drainages. The fire slowly backed downslope in the Elk Lake Creek and East Humbug Creek <br />
drainages. The low clouds prevented helicopter use. Additional containment line was added on both the existing <br />
north and south containment lines. Fire crews worked to prepare road systems and hand lines north and <br />
northwest of the fire area to be primary or contingency lines as part of the long-term fire suppression strategy. <br />
Preparation work is being done along an estimated 40 miles of forest roads. On the southwest side a hand line <br />
was constructed to connect the road system to the Beachie Creek Fire scar to be used as an anchor point. Along <br />
the southeast side firefighters patrolled the line. Extensive mop up work was done along Forest Road 6350 on <br />
the east side of the fire as crews work to secure that edge to keep the fire within containment line. The two spot <br />
fires east of the line were monitored and remain secured.<br />
<br />
Planned Actions: Under moderated weather conditions fire activity is expected to be less active but still expected <br />
to creep, smolder, and have occasional group tree torching because fuel conditions remain extremely dry. The <br />
fire will continue to move in the Upper Dickey Creek, Mother Lode Creek, Pansey Creek, and Battle Creek <br />
drainages and back downslope in the East Humbug Creek drainage. Helicopters remain on standby to be used <br />
for water bucket drops if cloud and smoke conditions improve. Existing containment lines will be monitored as <br />
firefighters watch for any trees or pockets of heat that could threaten the lines. Mop up work and hazard tree <br />
removal will be done along Forest Road 6350 to secure the fire line. On the south side firefighters will patrol and <br />
monitor existing line and work on a hand line to the southwest. Crews and equipment will be used to prepare <br />
lines using several road systems northwest and north of the fire area.<br />
 <br />
Weather: The weather today is expected to get warmer and drier. Temperatures will be 67-74 degrees, minimum <br />
humidity levels from 38% to 48%, and winds out of the west/northwest at 5-10 mph with gusts up to 15 mph<br />
<br />
Evacuations:  The Marion County Sheriff has issued a Level 1 “Be Ready” evacuation advisory only for <br />
Breitenbush Hot Springs. Residents should be aware of the danger that exists in their area, monitor emergency <br />
services websites and local media, and make an action plan should the evacuation level rise. The advisory can <br />
be viewed at:  https://www.flashalert.net/id/MarionSheriff?alert=1.<br />
<br />
Closures:  For the safety of wildland firefighters and the public, the National Forests have enacted area closures <br />
that prevent the public from being upon National Forest System lands in the vicinity of the Bull Complex Fire. All <br />
Forest lands that are south and west of Forest Road 46, and east of the Riverside Fire perimeter are closed. The <br />
entire length of Forest Road 46 is closed. Lands within the 2020 Lionshead and Beachie Creek Fire areas are <br />
also closed.  See the closure orders and maps at https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/closures/7773/.<br />

Cedar Creek Fire: The fire is 55,187 acres and 87% contained. Firefighters continue to focus their efforts on <br />
mopping up hot spots and smoky areas along Highway 20. The thermal cameras are being used around structures <br />
and private lands to locate additional hot spots in the area. Excavators, graders, and dozers are improving and <br />
repairing dozer lines. Aerial resources will be in the immediate area throughout the hillsides providing additional <br />
assistance along with buckets of water where needed. The cedar creek fire will transition into a local type 3 team <br />
on Tuesday morning.</span>

Warmer temperatures today could lead to increased smoke from the interior of the fires, particularly on the <br />
northwestern portion of the Walker Creek Fire. These interior smokes do not threaten containment<br />
lines and may persist until a significant weather event occurs.<br />
<br />
Operations<br />
Firefighters continue to backhaul unnecessary pumps, hoses, equipment,and all trash from fire containment <br />
lines.<br />
<br />
Chickadee Creek Fire<br />
Fire crews are continuing mop-up and worked yesterday to add depth to containment lines on the southern <br />

After yesterday’s significant rainfall, fire activity was relatively quiet. Night shift crews and heavy equipment <br />
completed contingency lines in the southwest portion of the fire to protect private timber lands. Today, firefighters <br />
are scouting and prepping line, continuing north up the west side of the fire in anticipation of drying fuels for burn <br />
operations in the area. On the north portion, crews are tying in light fuels in the valley to minimize impacts, and <br />
cold trailing. On the east flank, dozers and crews are constructing direct line to protect additional private timber <br />
land. Moving south on the east flank, direct line is also being constructed to tie into previously constructed line in <br />
the south to secure the fire’s edge. Firefighters will be looking at opportunities for indirect burning operations in <br />
the next few days while weather conditions are favorable to do so. There was minimal fire growth reported <br />
yesterday and the increase is likely from burning that happened prior to the rain.<br />
<br />
The Oregon State Fire Marshal’s office currently has six taskforces working during the day and four taskforces <br />
working at night. Key focuses for firefighters today will be mopping up near structures on the eastern and <br />
northeastern flanks of the fire. Crews will also be working today to assess homes on the westside of the fire.<br />
<br />
Another key focus for structural firefighters will be the protection of critical infrastructure on Round Mountain. The <br />
mountain is home to FFA communication, internet and cellular tower services that are vital to the area.<br />
<br />
Behavior:Fine fuel moistures today will be in the 6-8% range. Low fire behavior is expected through all fuel types <br />
with creeping surface fire and single or small group torching under protected canopies in timber. Afternoon <br />
spread will be possible in light fuels by late afternoon. <br />
<br />
Weather: Today will have a light haze and a few afternoon clouds. Temperatures in the valleys will be 71-76 <br />
degrees, with a relative humidity of 19-23%. Winds will be light and variable in the morning, becoming north-<br />
northwest in the afternoon at 5-8 mph with gusts less than 15 mph.<br />
<br />
In some years, the amount of rain we have received at this time of year could be considered a season ending <br />
event. This season, however, is not a typical season. This area is in its second consecutive year of drought and <br />
entered this fire season in the highest classification of drought measure possible. Likewise, fuel moistures have <br />
been at or near record lows for most of the year. Just as yesterday’s rains will not fill our empty reservoirs, it will <br />
also not automatically bring an end to this fire season.<br />
<br />
Evacuations: Multiple Evacuation Levels have been issued by the Lake County Sheriff’s Office. See this link for <br />
entering a specific address in the upper right corner in this interactive map:<br />
https://geo.maps.arcgis.com/apps/PublicInformation/index.html?appid=f8a0d8814a67445a9e6bf3485f4fd24f <br />

<br />
Temporary Flight Restrictions: A Temporary Flight Restriction is in place over the Cougar Peak Fire. Please <br />
consult the Notice to Airman for specifics. Red Cross Evacuation Shelter: The Lakeview shelter and planned <br />
emergency shelter in LaPine will both be on standby starting Saturday. If the need arises, staff are available to <br />
reopen the shelter. Wildfires are a No Drone Zone. If you fly, we can’t. Whenever a drone is spotted near the fire, <br />
all aircraft are grounded until we can be sure the drone is clear of the area. For more information, visit <br />

Current Situation:<br />
<br />
Yesterday’s reduced fire behavior continued a much-needed reprieve, allowing firefighters to connect and <br />
strengthen firelines and increase containment on both fires. The beneficial weather allowed crews to directly <br />
engage fire edges where fire activity was dampened. Firing operations were minimal as fuels need to be dry <br />
enough to carry fire. Firefighters depend on fine fuels such as grasses and pine needles to help get firing <br />
operations established; when humidity is high and temperatures are low, moisture in fine fuels is increased <br />
making it difficult to carry fire. Heavy fuels, such as dead and down logs, take longer to absorb water, and <br />
therefore hold fire longer. <br />
<br />
Today, firefighters will continue to use weather conditions to their advantage by working directly on the fire edges <br />
and strengthening firelines as conditions allow. Today’s weather will exemplify a typical September day in the <br />
Southern Cascade Range with temperatures around 70 degrees, high humidity, and mild winds. Fire conditions <br />
and operational activities will be largely unchanged from yesterday because the stable weather will provide for <br />
mild burning conditions and limited fire spread, allowing fire fighters to continue their work. <br />
<br />
Smith Fire<br />
Acreage: 44,410 | Containment: 19%<br />
Firefighters will maintain fire at the existing footprint through patrol and mop-up operations in Divisions F and E. <br />
Indirect line construction along Forest Road 2719 with preparations for firing operations later in the week will <br />
continue in both divisions. Work will continue on the spot fires located south of Hemlock Lake in Division A.<br />
<br />
Firefighters will maintain their strong presence in Ash Valley, securing firelines around structures. Highway 28 <br />
preparations will continue as crews get closer to completing the removal of fuels, making the road ready to serve <br />
as a containment line for firing operations as weather conditions allow.<br />
<br />
Firefighters continue to find heat near firelines in Division E, although they are finding less each day due to <br />
successful mop-up operations and moist weather conditions. Across both divisions patrols and mop-up will <br />
continue to ensure fire edges remain secure.<br />
<br />
Big Hamlin Fire<br />
Acreage: 19,035 | Containment: 75%<br />
<br />
Fireline suppression repair will continue in fully extinguished sections with patrol and mop-up ongoing where heat <br />
remains on fire edges, including the spot from several days ago.<br />
<br />
Yesterday, successful work on the western edge allowed containment to increase. Crews will closely monitor fire <br />
progression from Highway 29 as the fire slowly backs into Jackson Creek. Some sections of this line may be <br />
burned out, if conditions allow, to help even out the line as it backs toward the highway.<br />
<br />
Weather and Fuel Conditions:<br />
Cloudy conditions will remain over the fire until this afternoon, limiting fire spread. Once clouds move out, <br />
humidity will drop, but weather conditions will allow for continued fire activity that is mostly creeping and <br />
smoldering. The area has settled into a characteristic weather pattern for this time of year with temperatures in <br />
the low 70s, humidity above 35%, light winds from the west, and mostly sunny skies. These conditions are <br />
expected to remain for the next several days and will result in fire activity that mirrors today. Areas with heavy <br />
dead and downed trees, and underneath tree canopies where moisture didn’t penetrate, may experience tree <br />
torching and some active fire.<br />
<br />
Evacuation Notices:<br />
The Ash Creek-South Umpqua Road remains at a Level 3: Go (Leave immediately). As of 8 am on September <br />
11, Dumont 2810 to Jackson Creek was reduced to Level 1: Be Ready. The interactive web map depicts <br />
evacuation areas and levels: https://dcor.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?<br />

<br />
Incident Summary:  The Great Basin Incident Management Team 2 took command of the Rough Patch Complex <br />
and Jack Fires at 6:00 a.m. Both fires are being managed under a full suppression strategy using containment <br />
and confinement tactics to minimize fire spread to prevent loss of valuable resources.  Objectives include <br />
keeping the fires as small as possible while working toward full containment. <br />
<br />
Weather in the area is forecast to be cooler and more humid. Some precipitation was received across the fire <br />
Thursday night, with .10 to .30 inches of rain received in some locations.  It is predicted to remain at these <br />
seasonably lower temperatures for the next few days. Weather conditions east of the Cascades could bring more <br />
humidity and cloud cover to the fire area, perhaps even some drizzle on Friday. These changes reflect the typical <br />
patterns for this time of year and may have the potential to diminish fire activity, especially if prolonged over <br />
several days.  <br />
<br />
Chaos and Little Bend Fires:  The Chaos fire is at 24,462 acres and the Little Bend Creek Fire is at 8,569 acres.  <br />
On the north end of the Chaos Fire, firefighters assessed the spot fire that crossed the 2460 road.   It is currently <br />
burning at approximately three acres. With the very steep and rugged landscape in mind, crews have identified <br />
specific terrain features they are using in efforts to contain the spot and minimize its growth. Helicopters continue <br />
to support this priority with water drops and reconnaissance flights. On the southeast section of the Little Bend <br />
Creek Fire, crews are utilizing the 3816 road as a primary control line after the fire crossed over a section of the <br />
3850 road on Tuesday. <br />
<br />
Jack and Buckhead Fires:  The Jack Fire is at 23,990 acres and the Buckhead fire is at 6,536 acres.  The Jack <br />
Fire is contained along the west, north, and northeast perimeter. The fire has not grown for several days.  Fire <br />
crews are assessing the eastern edge for direct control operations. Firefighters are focusing on the southwest <br />
corner of the Buckhead Fire near the 100 road where they have contained small spot fires that resulted also <br />
during Tuesday’s wind event.  Due to the proximity of the Smith Fire, which is part of the Devil’s Knob Complex, <br />
close coordination is ongoing between the two Incident Management Teams managing each complex.  <br />
<br />
Near Minky Fire:  The Near Minky Fire is at 4,867 acres.  This fire lays south of the Jack and Buckhead Fires.  <br />
The entire perimeter is contained except for the northwest corner, which is where it connects to the Buckhead <br />
Fire. Activity has been minimal for approximately two weeks. <br />
<br />
Closures:  Copies of all closures and maps can be found at https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/closures/7758/. <br />
<br />
Amended BLM Roseburg District fire closure: BLM road 24-1-26 (Francis Creek) from the junction with BLM road <br />
25-1E-31 (Canton Creek Road) North to the Roseburg District Boundary in Township 24 South Range 1 West <br />
Section 1 will remain closed. <br />
 <br />
<br />
The Umpqua and Willamette National Forests have temporarily closed areas of both forests due to the Jack Fire, <br />
Rough Patch Complex Fire, and Devil's Knob Complex Fire. <br />
<br />
Highway 138 between Roseburg and Diamond remains open. Expect short delays for hazard tree removal <br />
operations east of Glide. Slow down and be alert.</span>

Westfir, OR – Higher humidities and as much as .4 inches of rain fell across the fire area with most of the rain on <br />
the eastern side and very little on the western side. General fire behavior was moderate due to the cool moist <br />
weather conditions.  This fire becomes active when relative humidity is below 35%. When wind, slope and terrain <br />
align, the fire activity will escalate.  Firefighters will be working over the next few shifts to improve indirect lines <br />
and scout for opportunities to move indirect lines closer to the main body of the fire. Work on primary and <br />
contingency lines around the southwest, east and northeast sides of the fire continued. Smoke conditions <br />
moderated significantly and we can expect this trend to continue for the next few days. No burning operations <br />
were undertaken due to the rain and increased humidity which would have made the outcome less than <br />
desirable.  It is not anticipated that firing operations will take place in the next 24 hours.<br />
<br />
The spot fires on the south facing slopes in Nehi Creek, Purdue Creek towards Christy Creek, and south toward <br />
Evangiline Creek will respond to lower humidity and solar heating.<br />
<br />
Weather:  A weak area of high pressure will briefly set up across the area on Saturday, with mostly sunny skies, <br />
and temperatures returning to near-normal values for this time of year. Expect highs in the mid 60s to mid 70s <br />
over the next few days. After another night of excellent relative humidity recovery, relative humidity values will fall <br />
into the 35 to 45 percent range on Saturday.<br />
<br />
Smoke: We should see another day of “Good” air quality and minimal smoke across most of the outlook area. <br />
The smoke that had settled into Bend and La Pine is slowly clearing out and today should be much improved, but <br />
still a bit hazy.<br />
<br />
Safety: Forest closures are still in effect so, “Know before you go”. Firefighters, recreationists and hunters are <br />
sharing the same roads so be aware of increased traffic and drive accordingly.<br />
<br />
Closures: There are numerous road closures in effect, including Road 19, Road 1910 going west towards 1802 <br />
and others in the Middle Fork Complex area. For more information, visit <br />

onconully, WA: Yesterday crews worked on hot spots within the fire and worked to secure perimeter lines. <br />
Division Charlie (north portion of the fire) worked to finish up black line operations and were able to secure <br />
another portion of their division which helped with containment numbers. Division Xray (northeast portion of the <br />
fire) worked hot spots and continue working in 150 ft from the perimeter. The repair group finished up work on <br />
the Kerr Campground and moved to Oriole Campground. This is repair work to clean up trees and debris from <br />
the fire. Division Foxtrot (south end of the fire) finished up perimeter control and is now in full patrol status. Today <br />
crews will continue more of the same work in their divisions. Over the next few days crews will remove <br />
equipment that is no longer needed on the fire and focus on repair and cleanup. Some of those repair standards <br />
include: chipping and disbursing of large concentrations of unburned fuels created during suppression, identify <br />
and inventory fences, and other damages that were created by suppression efforts. They will remove garbage, <br />
litter, and flagging. The only flagging that will remain in place are in hazard areas.   <br />
<br />
Yesterday there was steady rainfall most of the afternoon and into the night. This was not enough to make a <br />
significant difference on the fire but did help with keeping the dust down on the roads. Today the max <br />
temperature on the ridgelines will be 60 and sunny with humidity hovering around 48%. Winds are expected to <br />
be 4-6 mph throughout the day.  <br />
<br />
Road closures remain in effect and are being evaluated on a daily basis. The main reason for the closures is for <br />
firefighter safety and the safety of citizens. Please adhere to the closures.<br />
<br />
FS Road 37 is closed at the junction with FS Road 42 ·       <br />
FS Road 38 is closed at the forest boundary north of Conconully    <br />
Mineral Hill Road is closed just west of Conconully <br />
<br />
There are no evacuation orders in place at this time. <br />
<br />
The Muckamuck Fire started by lightning on Saturday August 4, 2021. The fire is located in and around the Town <br />
of Conconully, Washington. Mixed conifer with dead and downed materials are the primary fuel source along with <br />
ponderosa pine, sagebrush, and cured grass meadows. The fire is estimated at 13,319 and is now 83% <br />
contained. During the first phase of the fire there were 4 primary and 3 secondary structures lost. <br />
<br />
Did you know? Yesterday’s topic talked about the different positions on an Incident Management Team. Over the <br />
next few days, we will take a few of those positions each day and talk about what their role looks like. Incident <br />
Commander: This role is responsible for the overall objectives and safety of the team, personnel, and the fire. In <br />
the private sector this person would be the “Mayor” of the city. The Incident Commander (IC) handles the political <br />
aspects of the fire as far as keeping local leaders and other agencies apprised of what’s going on. Operations <br />
Section Chief: This person is responsible for the overall operations on the actual fire. He/she has a field <br />
operations person that is working with the crews in the field on the actual fire. Field Operations reports each day <br />
to the Operations Section Chief. They collaborate on resource needs, objectives and what’s needed to move <br />
forward on extinguishment and containment of the fire. This team is critical to fire control and safety of the <br />
firefighters on the ground. Stay tuned for tomorrows brief when we talk about 2 more roles.    <br />
<br />
Fire information and the incident command post is located at Omak Stampede Grounds in Omak, WA. Fire <br />
information contact is Don Malone at (509) 822-8125 or you can also follow us on Facebook @NEWIMT3</span>

Incident Summary:  The Great Basin Incident Management Team 2 took command of the Rough Patch Complex <br />
and Jack Fires at 6:00 a.m. Both fires are being managed under a full suppression strategy using containment <br />
and confinement tactics to minimize fire spread to prevent loss of valuable resources.  Objectives include <br />
keeping the fires as small as possible while working toward full containment. <br />
<br />
Weather in the area is forecast to be cooler and more humid. Some precipitation was received across the fire <br />
Thursday night, with .10 to .30 inches of rain received in some locations.  It is predicted to remain at these <br />
seasonably lower temperatures for the next few days. Weather conditions east of the Cascades could bring more <br />
humidity and cloud cover to the fire area, perhaps even some drizzle on Friday. These changes reflect the typical <br />
patterns for this time of year and may have the potential to diminish fire activity, especially if prolonged over <br />
several days.  <br />
<br />
Chaos and Little Bend Fires:  The Chaos fire is at 24,462 acres and the Little Bend Creek Fire is at 8,569 acres.  <br />
On the north end of the Chaos Fire, firefighters assessed the spot fire that crossed the 2460 road.   It is currently <br />
burning at approximately three acres. With the very steep and rugged landscape in mind, crews have identified <br />
specific terrain features they are using in efforts to contain the spot and minimize its growth. Helicopters continue <br />
to support this priority with water drops and reconnaissance flights. On the southeast section of the Little Bend <br />
Creek Fire, crews are utilizing the 3816 road as a primary control line after the fire crossed over a section of the <br />
3850 road on Tuesday. <br />
<br />
Jack and Buckhead Fires:  The Jack Fire is at 23,990 acres and the Buckhead fire is at 6,536 acres.  The Jack <br />
Fire is contained along the west, north, and northeast perimeter. The fire has not grown for several days.  Fire <br />
crews are assessing the eastern edge for direct control operations. Firefighters are focusing on the southwest <br />
corner of the Buckhead Fire near the 100 road where they have contained small spot fires that resulted also <br />
during Tuesday’s wind event.  Due to the proximity of the Smith Fire, which is part of the Devil’s Knob Complex, <br />
close coordination is ongoing between the two Incident Management Teams managing each complex.  <br />
<br />
Near Minky Fire:  The Near Minky Fire is at 4,867 acres.  This fire lays south of the Jack and Buckhead Fires.  <br />
The entire perimeter is contained except for the northwest corner, which is where it connects to the Buckhead <br />
Fire. Activity has been minimal for approximately two weeks. <br />
<br />
Closures:  Copies of all closures and maps can be found at https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/closures/7758/. <br />
<br />
Amended BLM Roseburg District fire closure: BLM road 24-1-26 (Francis Creek) from the junction with BLM road <br />
25-1E-31 (Canton Creek Road) North to the Roseburg District Boundary in Township 24 South Range 1 West <br />
Section 1 will remain closed. <br />
 <br />
<br />
The Umpqua and Willamette National Forests have temporarily closed areas of both forests due to the Jack Fire, <br />
Rough Patch Complex Fire, and Devil's Knob Complex Fire. <br />
<br />
Highway 138 between Roseburg and Diamond remains open. Expect short delays for hazard tree removal <br />
operations east of Glide. Slow down and be alert.</span>

<br />
Yesterday: Moderate precipitation fell across the fire, with a tenth to two-tenths of an inch measured in some <br />
areas. The moisture helped slow fire progression and behavior, allowing firefighters to continue suppression <br />
efforts in key focus areas. The spot fire along American Ridge slowed significantly, with minimal growth in that <br />
area. Structure protection continued along the Highway 410 corridor, as a precautionary measure should the fire <br />
continue to spread in that direction. Crews and heavy equipment worked to reduce vegetation along Forest Road <br />
(FR) 1709 after several days of work in this area to provide a safe place for firefighters to conduct firing <br />
operations in the days ahead. Firing operations were halted yesterday off FR 1706 due to the rain and <br />
unfavorable burning conditions. Crews continued to work to secure line and slow fire spread around Edgar Rock. <br />
Along the southern edges of the fire, mop up and repair work continued.<br />
 <br />
Today: Pacific Northwest Team (PNW) 10 (Lawson) assumed command of the incident as of 6:00 a.m. Thanks to <br />
PNW2 (Allen) for a smooth transition. Heavier fuels are still dry despite the rain, and smoldering heat and fire <br />
activity is expected to continue as the area dries out. Firefighters will remain focused on establishing point <br />
protection for structures along the Highway 410 and Bumping River Road corridor. Prep work and firing <br />
operations are expected to continue off of FR 1706 and 1709 to keep fire away from values at risk in the area.  <br />
The wildland fire module is hoping to continue firing operations from Burnt Mountain to Shellrock Peak along the <br />
trail system in the William O. Douglas Wilderness if fuels become dry enough to achieve objectives.</span>

<br />
The Summit Trail Fire received a half-inch of rain overnight, reducing fire activity throughout the fire area. Light <br />
rain showers persisted for nearly 12 hours, allowing small fuels such as dead grass, pine needles, and small <br />
sticks and twigs to absorb enough moisture that they will likely require several days of lower humidity and wind to <br />
dry out before supporting active fire movement. Larger fuels such as branches, limbs, and snags may still <br />
continue to burn despite these wetter conditions. Spot fires are likely to surface in the coming days as the <br />
smoldering debris on the forest floor dries out and reignites. <br />
<br />
Operations: On the northwest side of the fire, crews evaluated the burnout operation from the previous day and <br />
attempted to apply more fire to the inside fire edge to increase burnout depth. Due to the high humidity, the <br />
vegetation was not receptive in this area, so crews redirected their efforts to mop up material near the edge of <br />
the fire and move it more interior, working their way across the north side of the fire towards Stall Creek. <br />
Southeast of Stall Creek, firefighters completed their planned ignitions and contained spots that were threatening <br />
existing handlines. On the northeastern flank, crews discovered and suppressed a 1/3-acre spot fire that had <br />
crossed the line. Patrols continue on the east side near Lynx Mountain, Brush Mountain, and Bear Springs, and <br />
along the southern portions of the fire using a combination of air and ground resources. Although visibility and <br />
weather conditions have limited the use of air support, these aircraft remain available and ready to respond if <br />
needed. Fire managers have created a Suppression Repair Group that will begin working to repair culverts and <br />
roads, remove log decks from control lines, and remove any existing equipment that is no longer needed around <br />
the fire area.  <br />
<br />
Weather: Light showers may linger early this morning but should clear the region before midday. The sun will <br />
return this afternoon, but clouds will increase late in the day ahead of another weather system. Temperatures will <br />
remain near seasonal normals and afternoon humidity will stay high. The rest of the weekend through early next <br />
week will be partly cloudy and seasonably mild. Cool and breezy conditions will follow a cold front on <br />
Wednesday. <br />
<br />
Safety: The health and safety of firefighters and the public is the first priority. The public is strongly encouraged to <br />
stay safely clear of the active fire area. Firefighters are conducting operations under protocols to mitigate the risk <br />
of COVID-19.</span>

<br />
Weather and Fire Behavior: Light rain showers fell over the fire area yesterday though heavy fuels remain very <br />
dry. Heavy fuels are large diameter snags, logs, and large limb wood, that ignite and are consumed more slowly <br />
than finer fuels like grass, leaves, and moss. The heavy fuels are still burning and as the finer fuels dry out, they <br />
will again contribute to fire spread. Today will be drier and warmer, mostly sunny in the morning with increasing <br />
clouds in the afternoon, and light winds from the west-southwest. Today’s forecasted light winds, cloud cover, <br />
and increased relative humidity will moderate fire activity.<br />
<br />
Yesterday:  Using both hand and aerial ignition, firefighters were able to conduct firing operations in the afternoon <br />
along Devil’s Backbone. Heavy fuels were receptive to burning, however additional burning may be required to <br />
secure the line due to the high moisture content of some of the finer fuels which prevented them from fully <br />
consuming during firing operations. Where burnout operations were completed several days ago, firefighters <br />
continued patrolling, mopping up (extinguishing or removing any remaining burning material along or near the fire <br />
line), and securing the line. Crews also made good progress completing road work needed to ensure safe <br />
access for fire personnel on Forest Roads 8410 and 5900.<br />
<br />
Today: If conditions allow, firefighters plan to continue firing along the Devil’s Backbone, from Stormy Mountain <br />
north toward Brennegan Creek. Aerial ignition to reduce fuels adjacent to the containment line may also continue <br />
north of Brennegan Creek and South of Junior Point. Mop up of previously completed burnouts will also continue <br />
where needed. Due to increasing confidence in containment lines on the southeast side of the fire, structure <br />
protection crews will begin breaking down the network of hoses, pumps, and other equipment, working south of <br />
Hollywood Beach and into the First Creek Area.<br />
<br />
Evacuations: Level 1 (Be Ready): All properties along South Lakeshore Road (from just north of Lake Chelan <br />
State Park to the end of the roadway), First Creek Road and Granite Falls Road. A map of current evacuation <br />
levels is available at: bit.ly/2WhU9Nu and additional information is available from Chelan County Emergency <br />
Management (facebook.com/ccsoem/).</span>

<br />
Tonasket, WA:  Rainfall totals along the fire since 5am this morning range between .34 to .37 inches of rainfall <br />
(NWS – Spokane).  Rainfall started around noon yesterday in the fire area, continuing throughout the night.  Fire <br />
behavior decreased throughout the day, with minor torching still visible throughout the early afternoon, pushing <br />
smoke down through the Antoine Creek drainage. <br />
<br />
No infrared flight was flown yesterday due to the heavy cloud cover and rainfall.  Burnout operations were <br />
considered, but ultimately dropped as near-term forecasted rainfall and rising relative humidity would have made <br />
the operation unsuccessful. <br />
<br />
Due to the duration and amount of rainfall, fire behavior will minimize for at least the next 48 hours.  Crews will <br />
evaluate conditions on the ground and create plans for direct line along the fire on the northwest flanks of <br />
Bonaparte Mountain, where available and safe for crews to engage.  Crews will continue to monitor and patrol <br />
the other sections of the fire, locating and extinguishing hotspots along the line.<br />
<br />
The temperature will moderate out to typical seasonal highs for this time of year, climbing to the mid-sixties.  <br />
Smoke will still be present within the fire as fuels, such as downed logs and stump holes continue to smolder and <br />
burn.  <br />
<br />
Evacuation levels will be evaluated today and through the weekend for reduction.</span>
