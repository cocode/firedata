This will be the last Bolt Creek Fire update from Northwest Incident Management Team 8 (NWIMT8), Kevin Stock, Incident <br />
Commander. NWIMT8 would like to thank all the cooperators, stakeholder, communities, agencies, and firefighters for the support and <br />
cooperation provided during the Bolt Creek Fire. It takes all your participation to provide a successful outcome. Please continue to <br />
provide the same support to Western Washington Incident Management Team, Kent Standford, Incident Commander, who will assume <br />
management of the fire Wednesday morning.<br />
<br />
Road Closures:<br />
The Washington Department of Transportation’s (WSDOT) geotechnical team was on site along the Highway 2 corridor yesterday <br />
identifying falling and other hazards.  Identified hazards will need to be mitigated prior to opening of the highway.  A meeting is <br />
scheduled for Tuesday afternoon to review the progress and to determine if the highway is safe for the public travel.<br />
<br />
Highway 2 from the east side of Miller River Road (Old Cascade Highway) to the west side of 5th Street in Skykomish remains closed <br />
to all, with the exception of fire personnel. Highway 2 remains closed just east of Index-Galena Road, near Sunset Falls (MP 36), to the <br />
junction of 5th St N into the town of Skykomish (MP 49). Local highway access is permitted for residents with identification from the <br />
west closure at MP 36 to the intersection of Miller River Road (Old Cascade Highway). We ask residents to please be mindful of the fire <br />
crews working along the highway and follow posted speed limits.<br />
 <br />
Update:<br />
The strategic objectives for the Bolt Creek Fire are focused on efforts to protect values at risk along Highway 2 corridor and prevent <br />
future spread to the west and east. These objectives have been met. Fire crews are now monitoring and patrolling completed control <br />
lines.  While fire spread in the Wild Sky Wilderness is expected to be minimal because of rock outcrops and other holding features, <br />
firefighters continue to monitor the area.<br />
<br />
Clear skies and slightly higher temperatures created a drying trend resulting in more aggressive creeping and smoldering of vegetation <br />
within the control area. Materials being consumed provide visible smokey conditions among neighboring communities.  <br />
<br />
Weather and Fire Behavior:  Expect offshore flow this morning, leading to elevated fire weather conditions. Smoke is likely to be <br />
transported down valley to the west/south. By early afternoon, winds will relax and transition to north/northeasterly for the remainder of <br />
the afternoon when relative humidity will be lower than yesterday.   Average temperatures will be near 61°F on the upper ridges and <br />
79°F in the valleys. Relative humidity will drop down to around 35%. Expect fairly similar conditions Wednesday, but wind will return to <br />
west-northwest, creating onshore flow by the evening hours. A slow warming and drying trend will last through at least mid-week with <br />
little chance of precipitation.</span>

<br />
A dry cold front will be moving in from east British Columbia and is expected to reach the fire area today.  This weather pattern is often <br />
referred to as a "backdoor" cold front and is typically associated with passage movement from the north.  This change in weather <br />
patterns can generate winds that will shift to a northeast-southwest trajectory later in the day with potential gusts reaching 25-30 mph. <br />
<br />
This higher wind pattern potentially provides the ability for new noticeable ignitions to be located, due to previous lightning storms within <br />
the geographic area to which up until this time may have been dormant.  These winds could also loft embers from torching trees on the <br />
southern flank of the fire and potentially cause spotting across primary lines.   <br />
<br />
Fire managers are prepared to contain increased fire activity with direct attack utilizing hand tools, heavy equipment and aviation <br />
support as needed.  Fire managers are mitigating fire growth potential by removing fuel from roadways which creates a buffer area, <br />
these are referred to as alternate containment lines.  Alternate containment lines are only utilized if primary lines are no longer viable to <br />
provide containment. <br />
<br />
Due to the mixture of dead and down vegetation and diverse fuel loadings, firefighters continue to work diligently in their mop up <br />
standards.  In order to achieve containment, firefighters feel the ground for hot spots and utilize water on remnant heat sources to <br />
reduce any possibility or potential for reignition. <br />
<br />
Safety: Safety of firefighters and members of the public are our first priority.  All hunters are encouraged to become familiarized with the <br />
USFS closure area, don personal protective equipment and practice safe hunting practices as forest grouse season gets under way. <br />
<br />
Closures: An area closure remains in place for the Boulder Mountain Fire on the Colville National Forest. For a map and complete <br />
description of the closure area, including a list of trails and roads, go to https://www.fs.usda.gov/alerts/colville/alerts-notices.</span>

Status: The fire is 11% contained, with containment line on the west side of the fire between Forest Service Road 24 and Fifth Creek, <br />
the stretch from Charlton Lake west to the shore of Waldo Lake, and the north and west shores of Waldo Lake. Oakridge and <br />
communities west of the fire will experience the most smoke as southeast winds continue today. <br />
<br />
The West Zone of the fire is currently burning with low intensity creeping, and smoldering. Fire spread is occurring in areas with deep, <br />
dry litter and heavy fuels. The East Zone is experiencing fire behavior including creeping, smoldering, and single-tree torching. Fire <br />
growth is minimal. Sheltered heat may reemerge after the rain if fuels continue to be dry enough. <br />
<br />
West Zone Operations:  Heavy smoke and fog lingered through much of the fire area on Monday morning. This inhibited fire growth <br />
during the day but also limited firing operations in the morning. Along the south and southwestern edges, firefighters were able to make <br />
progress on firing operations along Forest Service Road 5871 and near Eagle Creek. Visibility cleared enough by afternoon for aerial <br />
ignitions by helicopter near Kwiskwis Butte. These operations reduce fuels between the fireline and the main fire. Crews continued <br />
mopping up along Forest Service Road 2409 and Forest Service Road 1928 where previous firing operations occurred on the western <br />
edge of the fire. <br />
<br />
As the wetter weather comes into the fire area, firefighter and public safety remains top priority. After steep terrain has burned, rocks <br />
once held in place by root systems or vegetation loosen and pose a hazard to firefighters. Dead or fire weakened trees (snags) can fall, <br />
compromising the fireline and presenting a risk to firefighters. Firefighters will continue cutting snags and extinguishing hot spots to <br />
secure the fire line where previous burning operations occurred. If the weather clears and conditions allow, crews are poised to take <br />
advantage of windows of opportunity for continued burning operations.    <br />
<br />
East Zone Operations: Hotshot crews are wrapping up their work on the fireline and containment line along Forest Service Road 4290. <br />
Charlton Lake west to Waldo Lake has been contained and the east side of Charlton Lake to the Cascade Lakes Highway is being <br />
improved as a fire break. On the east side of Waldo Lake, crews have completed 6 miles of fuel break, 75 feet deep, along Forest <br />
Service Road 5896 and Forest Service Road 5897 from Charlton Lake to Highway 58. More than 170 structures have been prepped on <br />
the north side of Odell Lake and near Crescent Junction, and some engines will be released today. Most of the protection work has <br />
been completed in campgrounds. <br />
<br />
Crews continue work to join Forest Service Road 4668 and Forest Service Road 4660 to create a break between Odell Lake, Davis <br />
Lake, and the Cascade Lakes Highway. Between Little Cultus Lake and Deer Lake, crews are brushing, chipping, and removing snags <br />
along Forest Service Road 640 to protect Cultus Mountain from future fire advancement. Final clean up is happening on the Forest <br />
Service Road 700 fuel break connecting Little Cultus Lake and the Cascade Lakes Highway. Heavy equipment including feller <br />
bunchers, masticators, and hydro axes continue work along the Cascade Lakes highway building a shaded fuel break 100 feet wide. <br />
This improvement not only protects values at risk from the Cedar Creek fire, but it will remain a valuable tool for managing fire in the <br />
future.</span>

Sedro Woolley, WA – Weather conditions along with dry fuels continue to increase fire activity on the lightning-caused Chilliwack <br />
Complex. Increased easterly winds, high temperatures, and low humidity throughout the area have prompted a Red Flag Warning from <br />
the National Weather Service through Sunday evening. On Friday, the Copper Lake and Copper Ridge fires merged, and the North <br />
Fork and Little Chill fires merged. The two fires are now known as Copper Lake and Little Chill fires, respectively. The Silesia Fire had <br />
significant growth and is approximately one mile from the forest boundary with the Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest. This fire <br />
activity has prompted the closure of the Silesia Creek Trail. The Chilliwack Complex is made up of several active fires (Little Chill, <br />
Copper Lake, Brush Creek, Silesia, and Little Beaver Creek).<br />
<br />
 Crews continue protection measures on a pack bridge and suspension bridge near the Brush Creek Fire and on the cable car <br />
potentially threatened by the Copper Lake Fire. Firefighters continue to utilize helicopter bucket work on the Little Beaver Creek Fire.<br />
<br />
<br />
The Washington Department of Ecology announced an Air Quality Alert due to current wildfire smoke from the fires in the North <br />
Cascades. North and northeasterly winds are moving into the area, pushing regional smoke impacts from fires into the greater <br />
Bellingham-Seattle metropolitan area. Increasing smoke impacts, reduced visibility and short periods of UNHEALTHY air quality are <br />
expected into Sunday. As southwest winds return late Sunday, smoke impacts will shift back into the Wenatchee, Chelan, and <br />
Okanogan valleys. Take precautions when recreating outdoors when heavy smoke is present. Learn more at Real-Time Air Quality Map <br />
| PurpleAir, airnow.gov or visit https://wasmoke.blogspot.com/.  <br />
  <br />
Trail and camp closures remain in effect due to fire activity. Closure information can be found at <br />
https://www.nps.gov/noca/planyourvisit/trail-conditions.htm  <br />

Due to decreased fire activity, this will be the last daily update. If conditions change, information will be shared via the Crockets Knob <br />
Fire’s Facebook and Inciweb.  <br />
<br />
 Weather: Today will be dry with light winds. Temperatures will be in the low-70s, and the minimal relative humidity will be near 25 <br />
percent. Widespread smoke haze will be visible throughout <br />
the area.  <br />
<br />
Operations: Yesterday two excavators began conducting suppression repairs on the fire. One excavator worked along FSR 4555 and <br />
the other along interior containment lines near Indian <br />
Rock Lookout. The excavators were scattering fuels and constructing water bars. Crews continued to patrol containment lines all <br />
around the fire looking for any remaining heat. For the <br />
foreseeable future, firefighters will continue focusing on suppression repairs, monitoring and patrol along containment lines.  <br />
<br />
Closures and Evacuations:  There are no county evacuation alerts, and County Road 20 (Middle Fork Road) is open to all motorists.  <br />
<br />
The Malheur and Umatilla National Forests’ fire area closure remains in effect for areas east of FSR 45. However, the Forests’ will likely <br />
reduce the closure area within the next day or two. To <br />
stay informed about closure information, please continue checking: https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/malheur/notices/?<br />
cid=STELPRD3845529   <br />
<br />
Smoke may be visible to nearby communities and Forest visitors. Smoke and air quality impacts within the state can be monitored by <br />
visiting: http://oregonsmoke.blogspot.com <br />
<br />
The Malheur National Forest’s Public Use Restriction is Phase C on the Blue Mountain and Prairie City Ranger Districts. No campfires <br />
or personal chainsaw use is allowed. The Umatilla <br />
National Forest remains in Phase B, which allows campfires only in designated campgrounds and recreation sites. For more <br />
information, please go to: <br />
https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/malheur/fire, and  <br />
<br />
https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/umatilla/alerts-notices. <br />
<br />
Fire Danger remains Extreme for the surrounding area. The public can help us by making good decisions when they recreate on public <br />
lands and by following local fire restrictions.</span>

Highlights: Firefighters assigned to the Hells Canyon/Snake River corridor have begun to transition out of the area. On Double Creek’s north and south sections, crews work to identify <br />
burning vegetation/hot spots. Log trucks arrive today to start hauling out the cut timber produced after creating Sturgill’s shaded fuel break. Also arriving at the incident are five <br />
excavators, which will be assigned used for suppression repairs. <br />
<br />
Double Creek Fire: The lightning-caused Double Creek Fire is a full suppression fire, with the protection of lives and property the primary objectives. Firefighters on the Snake River pulled out equipment <br />
and gear south of Pittsburgh landing. Today they begin to remove the same items north of the landing. Crews continue to monitor and respond to hot spots on the northern portion of the <br />
slop over, the area of the Double Creek that jumped the Imnaha River.  <br />
<br />
Eagle Cap Wilderness Fires  <br />
<br />
The Nebo, Sturgill, and Goat Mountain 2 Fires were lightning-caused and are being managed to protect public and private infrastructure while playing a natural role within designated <br />
Wilderness. Progress on managed fires is expressed through the accomplishment of ecological and fuel reduction objectives as opposed to progress on full suppression fires, which is <br />
expressed through containment. <br />
<br />
Nebo Fire: Forest Service Road 3920-100 is receiving chipping treatments to prepare the landscape to be more fire tolerant. Taking out the larger pieces of debris and spreading them around as <br />
finer materials benefit both sides of the road by allowing nutrient cycling to occur and expanding the fire break beyond just the fire side. Fuel loading is reduced. Future fire personnel <br />
can use the road as a fire break or conduct indirect operations if another fire is heading towards that area. Collectively, this road and the others serve as a network to slow the spread of <br />
future fires. <br />
<br />
Sturgill Fire: Along with the arrival of several logging trucks, five excavators are scheduled to arrive at the Joseph fairgrounds. They are going to be inspected, then sent out to aid in the suppression <br />
repair efforts that are starting to occur in various locations.   <br />
<br />
Goat Mountain 2 Fire: Fire activity on the Goat Mountain 2 Fire is minimal. Aircraft will continue to monitor the fire as smoke and weather permit. <br />
<br />
Weather: Temperatures continue to rise with the relative humidity dropping to around 30% through Wednesday afternoon.  Rain is expected to arrive Wednesday afternoon and persist <br />
through Thursday, while more rain is forecast to fall on Wednesday than Thursday, showers are expected to be scattered across the fire area on both days. <br />
<br />
Wallowa-Whitman National Forest Temporary Area Closures:  The Wallowa-Whitman National Forest issued Temporary Area Closures for the Double Creek Fire, Nebo Fire, and Sturgill <br />
and Goat Mountain 2 Fires. Closure Orders and Maps are available on the Wallowa-Whitman National Forest Fire Incident Updates page. <br />
<br />
Road Closures: Lostine River Road at the Forest Service boundary is closed. Highway 350 going to the town of Imnaha is open. Lower Imnaha Road and Dug Bar Road are closed, <br />
Upper Imnaha Road is closed, Hat Point Road is closed, and FS 39 Road is closed from Target Springs Junction to Ollokot Campground [including the Canal Rd (3920) and Lick Creek <br />
Road (3925)].  <br />
<br />
Restrictions: Fire Restrictions are in place for all National Forest System Lands within the Wallowa-Whitman National Forest. All fires are prohibited except when fueled by liquid <br />
petroleum, charcoal contained in a firepan, or contained in a woodstove with a chimney and spark arresting screen. All fires need to be attended at all times, fully extinguished when not <br />
attended, and located in an area free of vegetation within three feet of the fire.</span>

Overview: The Goat Rocks Fire continues to burn 1.5 miles northeast of the town of Packwood, Washington in and around the Goat <br />
Rocks Wilderness. Crews continue to thin fuels along roads and chip fuels cut from around structures. Additionally, crews will evaluate <br />
an opportunity to apply fire in a small area along the 4610 road to better secure the line protecting the town of Packwood. There is a <br />
possibility that smoke may be visible should burning occur. Fire managers continue to prioritize firefighter and public safety. <br />
 <br />
<br />
Firefighting Activity: Yesterday, crews worked to complete line construction along Forest Road 041 south of the fire. They removed <br />
excess trees, masticated underbrush, and chipped material cut when hand line was constructed. Other crews also chipped cut material <br />
around the Upper Timberline neighborhood and Forest Road 046. A small test burn in the Coal Creek drainage was conducted as an <br />
observation of the fire activity. A test burn involves setting a small fire in a controlled area to observe the potential fire behavior in a <br />
larger burn operation.  <br />
<br />
Today, resources on all divisions of the fire will continue chipping and removing vegetation from around structures and forest roads to <br />
improve the existing fuel breaks. Additionally, after the successful test burn yesterday, firefighters may be evaluating a potential burn <br />
operation above Coal Creek to clean up an area of unburned fuels between the wildfire and the Timberline community. This burn is <br />
intentional and intended to dispose of fuels that would otherwise be unsafe, costly, and time intensive to have removed. Packwood <br />
residents may smell and see more smoke in the area. This burn will not take place until the temperature and humidity values fall within <br />
a specific range where conditions are favorable; if conditions go outside that range, fire managers will not continue the burn. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Forest Closures: For information on current road and trail closures, you can go to this link: <br />
https://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fseprd1060181.pdf    <br />
<br />
<br />
Evacuations: All of Packwood and areas southwest of Butter Creek, including High Valley, have had their evacuation orders lifted. Areas <br />
northeast of Butter Creek and north of US-12, including Lower Timberline and Goat Rocks, are still at an Evacuation Level 1 (Be <br />
Ready). Upper Timberline remains at an Evacuation Level 2 (Be Set). <br />
<br />
Weather: The warming and drying trend will continue today with humidity values dropping into the upper 30% range, and temperatures <br />
rising into the 70s. Winds will continue out of the east, following the terrain and potentially gusting up to 15-20 miles per hour. With <br />
easterly winds, there may be more smoke in Packwood as the winds blow over White Pass and push the smoke into the Cowlitz River <br />
Drainage.</span>

Plain, WA – Lightning started the White River and Irving Peak Fires on August 11th. The Minnow Ridge Fire cause is undetermined. <br />
These fires are burning on the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest.<br />
<br />
Suppression Strategy – Due to rugged and steep terrain, fire managers continue to implement a long-term strategy to manage these <br />
fires, including the use of primary and contingency perimeter lines for containment. Tactics include completion and reinforcement of fire <br />
lines utilizing forest roads and constructed hand line.<br />
<br />
Current Situation – A local Type 3 Incident Management Team assumed command of the fires on September 7th and is currently <br />
managing the White River, Irving Peak, Meander, and now Minnow Ridge fires. The Meander Fire remains at 6 acres with very minimal <br />
fire activity. Smoke may be visible over the next several weeks as interior fuels continue to smolder and burn out, and multiple fires burn <br />
region-wide. Updates will be posted weekly unless significant new activity occurs.<br />
<br />
White River Fire – Acres: 3,184 (as of 9/13/2022); 5% contained; Location: Sears Creek area of the White River drainage, <br />
approximately 14 miles NW of Plain, WA.<br />
The fire area remains drier and more active along the southern edges. The fire footprint remains within the control lines, and geographic <br />
features being utilized as containment lines. Firefighters are working to establish an anchor point and maintain the structure protection <br />
along Sears Creek Road and Windmill Lane.<br />
<br />
Irving Peak Fire – Acres: 3,226 (as of 9/9/2022); 5% contained; Location: Approximately 16 miles NW of Plain, WA<br />
The Irving Peak Fire received some precipitation yesterday with minimal growth and fire activity. Firefighters continue to improve roads <br />
used as containment lines and monitor fire activity.<br />
<br />
Minnow Ridge Fire – Acres: 502 (as of 9/13/2022); 0% contained; Location: Chikamin Ridge, approximately 14 miles N of Plain, WA.<br />
Fire activity has been moderate and mainly consuming ground fuels. Firefighters continue scouting forest roads and fire lines previously <br />
utilized during past wildfire activity to determine if they may benefit the current fire suppression strategy.  <br />
<br />
Weather – A chance of showers exists over the fire area today, Wednesday, September 14th, with west winds around 6-8 mph. Cooler <br />
temperatures and higher relative humidity continue into later this week.<br />
<br />
Air Quality and Smoke – Current information about air quality and health recommendations during smoky conditions is available on the <br />
Washington Smoke Blog https://wasmoke.blogspot.com/<br />
<br />
Closures – An emergency closure issued by the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest remains in place and can be viewed here: <br />
www.fs.usda.gov/alerts/okawen/alerts-notices. The PCT remains open and is not directly impacted by these fires. Several trails in the <br />
Chikamin Ridge area are pending closure due to the Minnow Ridge Fire. Fire managers are asking people to please respect these <br />
closures while recreating in the area.<br />
<br />
Restrictions – Campfires are not allowed anywhere within the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest. Stage 2 Restrictions are now in <br />
effect for the entire forest, including campgrounds and wilderness areas: www.fs.usda.gov/detail/okawen/alerts-notices/?<br />
cid=fsbdev3_053600.<br />
<br />
Evacuations – Current Chelan County evacuation levels include a Level 2 evacuation (Be Prepared) for Sears Creek Road and Level 1 <br />
(Stay Alert) for White River Road and Little Wenatchee Road. www.co.chelan.wa.us/emergency-management/pages/active-<br />

						    <span class="textarea">Increased fire activity on some of the lightning caused fires, burning in the very remote, steep, and inaccessible terrain in the northwest <br />
corner of the Pasayten Wilderness Area, spurred trail and area closures over the holiday weekend. Hot, dry, and windy conditions are <br />
expected today as a trough moves into the area which is expected to create conditions for increased fire behavior. The Shull, The <br />
Parks, Kid, Three Fools, Skagit, and Elbow fires, located near the Canadian-U.S border, are expected to grow in acreage today.<br />
<br />
In a joint delegation with the National Park Service, a National Incident Management Organization Team, NIMO Team 2, assumed <br />
command yesterday over the six fires now being called the NW Pasayten Fires, located in the Pasayten Wilderness on the Methow <br />
Valley Ranger District of the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest, as well as the Chilliwack Complex Fires within the North Cascades <br />
National Park Service Complex.<br />
<br />
A number of closures are in effect including an area closure for the Freezeout Creek basin and a number of trails and portions of trails <br />
in the area. Portions of both the Pacific Crest Trail and Pacific Northwest Trail remain closed at this time.<br />
<br />
Smoke from these fires, and other fires burning in the region, may impact north central Washington communities over the next few <br />
days. Take precautions when recreating outdoors when heavy smoke is present. Learn more at Real-Time Air Quality Map | PurpleAir, <br />
airnow.gov or visit https://wasmoke.blogspot.com/.<br />
<br />
Update on individual NW Pasayten Fires:<br />
•     The Kid Fire, located on the ridge between Rock Creek and West Fork Pasayten, is approximately 8 miles south of the Canadian-<br />
U.S. border. The fire has been very active with spotting and torching of grouped trees. Yesterday, smokejumpers worked on protection <br />
of the historic airport cabin, situated about one quarter mile away from the Kid Fire, utilizing pumps and sprinklers. If conditions allow, <br />
smokejumpers will also be burning out unburned brush between the fire and the cabin.<br />
•     The Parks Fire is also very active. It crossed the border into Canada a couple of days ago. There is a Canadian Incident <br />
Management Team assigned to the Canadian portion (called the Heather Fire north of the border) of the Parks Fire. The fire is about <br />
one half mile from the Monument 83 Fire Lookout at the time of this release. Firefighters have prepared the lookout by wrapping the <br />
base with fire protective wrap.<br />
•    The Skagit Fire, located in Freezeout Creek 6 miles south of the border, spread northward and crossed over the top of the ridge and <br />
down the other side.<br />
•     Three Fools Fire, located 8 miles south of the border, is actively backing down the ridge and through an old burn scar, it has spotted <br />
north of the ridge. <br />
•     The Elbow Fire, located 6 miles south of the border, is actively backing down the slope near Skagit Peak.<br />
•     Tuesday, fire activity increased on the Shull Fire located 11 miles south of the border.</span>

MERLIN, Ore. – Rum Creek fire area is holding at 83 percent containment with no new fire growth.  Crews continue to be downsized, <br />
with 330 people remaining.  Unsettled weather will continue for several days bringing higher humidity levels and scattered showers.  <br />
Wind gusts of up to 22 mph are expected for the second day in a row for upper slopes and ridges.  Isolated lightning levels today and <br />
tomorrow are not predicted to start fires but could bring rain levels strong enough to wash soils, provide instability in burned areas, and <br />
be a safety concern for public and fire crews within the fire perimeter.  Crews will focus on suppression, mop up, patrol, rehab/repair, <br />
and hazard tree mitigation.<br />
<br />
Today we will begin the transition to a Type 3 Incident Management Team under the leadership of Incident Commander Brandon Kerns. <br />
The Type 3 team will assume full command at 0700, Tuesday, September 20, 2022.  As part of this transition, crews and equipment will <br />
be downsized. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Road Checkpoints: Road blocks are located at: Galice Rd north of Almeda; Peavine East Road at Bear Camp Road; Peavine West <br />
Road at Upper Bear Camp Road; Quartz Creek Road about 3 miles up (end of County maintenance); Hog Creek Road at Galice Road; <br />
and Galice Road at the bridge by Grave Creek Boat Ramp.<br />
<br />
Recreation Area Openings: The Rogue River Trail (river right) is open, as is Almeda County Park.  Rocky Bar, Robert Dean, Chair, and <br />
Rand Recreation sites remain closed at this time. The Rainie Falls National Recreation Trail (on river left) remains closed. The Grave <br />
Creek boat ramp is not accessible from Galice Road.  Additional recreation sites are being assessed.  Revised closure order and map: <br />
https://www.blm.gov/programs/public-safety-and-fire/fire-and-aviation/regional-info/oregon-washington/fire-restrictions.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
River status:  The Wild section of the Rogue River below Grave Creek is open.  The Smullin Visitor Center in Rand is now open for <br />
permits, and new Wild Section permits will be issued starting on Monday.  The recreation section of the Rogue River is open, however <br />
the Rand and Argo Boat Ramps are closed. Day users are recommended to take out at Almeda. Please call 541-471-6535 for more <br />

<br />
Klamath Falls, Ore. – Last night fire crews continued to use infrared cameras to identify areas of heat around the perimeter of the fire. <br />
They are mainly finding heat under juniper trees on the southern and western areas.<br />
<br />
Today is the last day the Oregon Department of Forestry’s Type 1 Incident Management Team will be in command of the fire. Transition <br />
to the local Type 4 team will happen tomorrow at noon. The objectives for the local team will remain the same. Multiple engines and <br />
crews will continue to mop up where it warrants.<br />
<br />
Weather today will be cooler and more humid. Gusty winds are expected in the late afternoon and early evening.<br />
<br />
Residential traffic is allowed in the fire area, but residents are encouraged to drive slowly and be aware of fire operation traffic as they <br />
travel through the fire. Bureau of Land Management lands in and around the fire area remain closed to the public.<br />
<br />
We would like to remind the public that Klamath and Lake counties are still in extreme fire danger. Human-cause fire stats are down this <br />
fire season, so please help your local resources by preventing anything that can spark a fire. Visit <br />
https://www.oregon.gov/odf/fire/pages/restrictions.aspx for fire restrictions in your area or areas you may be traveling to.  <br />
<br />
This will be the final fire update from the ODF IMT. The team would like to thank the cooperators and public for their support during the <br />
fire. Without local resources and support from the community our team would not have been as successful.</span>

						    <span class="textarea">White River and Irving Peak Fire Update<br />
September 14, 2022<br />
<br />
Plain, WA – Lightning started the White River and Irving Peak Fires on August 11th. The Minnow Ridge Fire cause is undetermined. <br />
These fires are burning on the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest.<br />
<br />
Suppression Strategy – Due to rugged and steep terrain, fire managers continue to implement a long-term strategy to manage these <br />
fires, including the use of primary and contingency perimeter lines for containment. Tactics include completion and reinforcement of fire <br />
lines utilizing forest roads and constructed hand line.<br />
<br />
Current Situation – A local Type 3 Incident Management Team assumed command of the fires on September 7th and is currently <br />
managing the White River, Irving Peak, Meander, and now Minnow Ridge fires. The Meander Fire remains at 6 acres with very minimal <br />
fire activity. Smoke may be visible over the next several weeks as interior fuels continue to smolder and burn out, and multiple fires burn <br />
region-wide. Updates will be posted weekly unless significant new activity occurs.<br />
<br />
White River Fire – Acres: 3,184 (as of 9/13/2022); 5% contained; Location: Sears Creek area of the White River drainage, <br />
approximately 14 miles NW of Plain, WA.<br />
The fire area remains drier and more active along the southern edges. The fire footprint remains within the control lines, and geographic <br />
features being utilized as containment lines. Firefighters are working to establish an anchor point and maintain the structure protection <br />
along Sears Creek Road and Windmill Lane.<br />
<br />
Irving Peak Fire – Acres: 3,226 (as of 9/9/2022); 5% contained; Location: Approximately 16 miles NW of Plain, WA<br />
The Irving Peak Fire received some precipitation yesterday with minimal growth and fire activity. Firefighters continue to improve roads <br />
used as containment lines and monitor fire activity.<br />
<br />
Minnow Ridge Fire – Acres: 502 (as of 9/13/2022); 0% contained; Location: Chikamin Ridge, approximately 14 miles N of Plain, WA.<br />
Fire activity has been moderate and mainly consuming ground fuels. Firefighters continue scouting forest roads and fire lines previously <br />
utilized during past wildfire activity to determine if they may benefit the current fire suppression strategy.  <br />
<br />
Weather – A chance of showers exists over the fire area today, Wednesday, September 14th, with west winds around 6-8 mph. Cooler <br />
temperatures and higher relative humidity continue into later this week.<br />
<br />
Air Quality and Smoke – Current information about air quality and health recommendations during smoky conditions is available on the <br />
Washington Smoke Blog https://wasmoke.blogspot.com/<br />
<br />
Closures – An emergency closure issued by the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest remains in place and can be viewed here: <br />
www.fs.usda.gov/alerts/okawen/alerts-notices. The PCT remains open and is not directly impacted by these fires. Several trails in the <br />
Chikamin Ridge area are pending closure due to the Minnow Ridge Fire. Fire managers are asking people to please respect these <br />
closures while recreating in the area.<br />
<br />
Restrictions – Campfires are not allowed anywhere within the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest. Stage 2 Restrictions are now in <br />
effect for the entire forest, including campgrounds and wilderness areas: www.fs.usda.gov/detail/okawen/alerts-notices/?<br />
cid=fsbdev3_053600.<br />
<br />
Evacuations – Current Chelan County evacuation levels include a Level 2 evacuation (Be Prepared) for Sears Creek Road and Level 1 <br />
(Stay Alert) for White River Road and Little Wenatchee Road. www.co.chelan.wa.us/emergency-management/pages/active-<br />
