Closures:<br />
Update: Crews and heavy equipment including feller bunchers, masticators, and chippers are working to establish and reinforce containment <br />
lines on the west and eastern edges of the main fire. The strategy is to flank the fire, directing it toward the north into the Wild Sky Wilderness <br />
where there are many rocks/holding features.  This strategy directs the fire away from higher values at risk and provides resources an anchor <br />
point to safely fight fire. The lines are along Forest Service Road (FSR) 6510 and Beckler Road (east) and FSR 6022 (Heybrook Lookout <br />
Road) from Highway 2 to the Index-Galena Road along the west.  The long-term plan is to extend these lines toward the north on established <br />
roads. Crews are safely assessing the fire and natural hazards above the road and taking actions to make the highway safe for public use.  <br />
<br />
Night shift firefighters patrolled and monitored the fire for any flare-ups. <br />
<br />
Washington State mobilized resources are being released as the need decreases for their services. Remaining engines continue to assist to <br />
remove fuels around structures and monitor perimeter lines.<br />
<br />
Weather and Fire Behavior: Westerly flow will continue today ahead of a potential disturbance that will move south along the west coast on <br />
Saturday. Expect mostly cloudy/ overcast skies, high humidity, and cooler temperatures associated with this system today and tomorrow. <br />
Precipitation chances increase this afternoon and evening as energy from the trough moves through the region. Daytime rainfall amounts will <br />
approach one to two tenths of an inch today. Today’s forecast is a temperature of 66 degrees, minimum relative humidity of 75%, winds will be <br />
southwest near 6 mph, and a 60% chance of precipitation.<br />
<br />
Evacuation Levels: Evacuation levels have changed effective Thursday, Sept. 15 at 12 p.m. noon. Fire movement has slowed over the past 48 <br />
hours. New guidance:<br />
<br />
Level 1 (Ready): Index – reduced from a Level 2 (Set).  No other evacuation levels in Snohomish County. Baring and Grotto and area along <br />
U.S. 2 to MP 48 (east of the Money Creek tunnel) remains at Level 3 (Go). Additionally, FS Road 65 (Beckler River Road) remains at level 3. <br />
Skykomish remains at level 1.<br />
The fire remains active and conditions could change quickly.   In order to keep the public safe, changes in evacuation levels might also be <br />
required.  Please be prepared.<br />
<br />
Current Evacuation and road closures can be found at: https://snohomish-county-public-safety-hub-snoco-gis.hub.arcgis.com/pages/wildfire<br />
<br />
Smoke: Updated information on air quality may be found at Washington Smoke Blog at https://wasmoke.blogspot.com/<br />
<br />
Sheltering: The Event Center in Startup and Red Cross Shelter at the Evergreen State Fairgrounds are both closed.  For Red Cross <br />
assistance, please call 1-800-RedCross.</span>

Summary: The Boulder Mountain Fire was detected on Wednesday August 31st, 2022, at approximately 6:00 pm. The fire is located in<br />
the Tacoma Creek and Boulder Mountain area, 9 miles Northwest of Cusick, Washington. A mix of State, Federal and Private land is<br />
impacted. The terrain is difficult, and the fire is burning in heavy timber, slash, and beetle infested trees. Cause of the fire remains<br />
under investigation.<br />
<br />
Weather|Anticipated Fire Behavior: Higher humidity levels and low cloud cover helped reduce fire activity yesterday. The sun did<br />
come out and begin the drying process later in the day but overnight temps and rising humidity took the edge off any gains.<br />
Today, expect windy conditions as a cold front approaches this evening. Winds will be out of the southwest again which will<br />
continue to push areas of heat further into the fire’s interior.<br />
<br />
Firefighters were able to employ infrared equipment to pinpoint and target hot spots, thus allowing for more direct firefighting efforts. Steady <br />
gains are being made daily as containment grew to 59%.<br />
<br />
Actions: Extensive mop up of the fire’s edge, coupled with patrolling will continue to take place over the next several days. The interior of the <br />
fire still has several areas of heat as large fuels continue to burn. Fallers are working to remove hazards trees allowing hand crews to move <br />
closer to the hot edge and continue suppression efforts. Additional resources are beginning to implement suppression repair in areas where <br />
the fire is contained.<br />
<br />
Important Information: Even with no, or limited smoke the Boulder Moutain Fire is far from ”out.” There are approximately 500 personnel still <br />
working on the fire and in the surrounding area, continuing to mop up the hot edges, cut hazard trees, and securing control lines. Not to <br />
mention all the heavy equipment repairing suppression dozer lines and roads used daily for various fire apparatus. The Colville National <br />
Forest still has a road and area closure in place to protect those responders still responding to this incident. Thank you to the public for <br />
adhering to this closure and their continued support of all the boots on the ground!</span>

Current Situation: The Lane County Sheriff’s Office reduced the evacuation level in all zones in and around the cities of Westfir, Oakridge, and <br />
High Prairie to Level 1 (Be Ready). A current map of the evacuation areas in Lane County is available at <br />
www.LaneCountyOR.gov/CedarCreek.<br />
<br />
Improving roads to serve as control features, firing operations, securing containment lines, and patrolling burned areasare all components of <br />
ongoing firefighting activities. Area residents will likely notice an increase in smoke as these important firing operations continue. In addition to <br />
the fire traffic, increased smoke and potential fog will affect visibility. Many forest and road closures remain in effect. For firefighter and public <br />
safety, please drive carefully, obey all road closures and traffic safety laws, and give firefighting crews and heavy equipment plenty of space.<br />
Though the Cedar Creek Fire is zoned and being managed by two Incident Management Teams, firefighters on the two zones are working in <br />
close coordination and are sharing firefighting resources. In the West Zone, the fire is backing downhill, flanking, and occasionally torching in <br />
dense timber. In the East Zone, the fire is minimally active; occasional torching and westerly winds may result in a slight increase in fire <br />
growth. These conditions are also facilitating the consumption of unburned fuels in the interior of the fire area. Smoke will continue to linger, <br />
impacting air quality.<br />
<br />
Oakridge Community Meeting: A community meeting is scheduled for 11 am Saturday, September 17 at the Oakridge High School Auditorium. <br />
The intent is to also stream the meeting on Facebook Live.<br />
<br />
West Zone Update: The western edge of the Cedar Creek Fire remains three to five miles from the town of Oakridge.<br />
As illustrated on the animated fire progression map at https://bit.ly/3S6IFUv, significant fire growth was associated with east winds about a <br />
week ago. Fire spread since then has largely been associated with burnout operations intended to bring the fire toward containment lines <br />
while weather is favorable and to reduce the intensity of the main fire when it gets there.<br />
<br />
West Zone Operations: Crews are having good success with firing operations in the West Zone of the Cedar Creek Fire. Ongoing firing <br />
operations are intended to reduce ground vegetation between the main fire and containment. Yesterday, firefighters worked around <br />
Huckleberry Lookout and made progress bringing the fire toward containment lines to the northwest and south. These firing operations will <br />
help to secure primary containment lines. When conditions allow, air resources, such as helicopters, drones, and planes are actively engaged <br />
in the firefighting mission.<br />
<br />
East Zone Operations: A hotshot crew went direct on the fireline around Charlton Lake where the fire spilled over FS 4290. Crews are <br />
strengthening the FS 4290 to serve as a control line to prevent future potential spread of the fire to the south. Crews are working FS 5897 to <br />
tie into the FS 4290 road to the north and to the Fuji Mountain trail and State Route 58 to the south.<br />
<br />
Structure assessment and protection is ongoing on the north shore of Odell Lake, including Shelter Cove and Sunset Cove, and the Diamond <br />
Peak subdivision. Road treatments are continuing on the west side of FS 4668 to meet 4660,creating a fuel break between Odell Lake and <br />
Davis Lake. Similarly, road work is continuing on FS 700 to connect with FS 4630 that will tie together Crane Prairie Reservoir and Little <br />
Cultus Lake, and around the southwest side of Cultus Mountain to create a fuel break.</span>

Sedro Woolley, WA – Weather conditions along with dry fuels continue to increase fire activity on the lightning-caused Chilliwack <br />
Complex. Increased easterly winds, high temperatures, and low humidity throughout the area have prompted a Red Flag Warning from <br />
the National Weather Service through Sunday evening. On Friday, the Copper Lake and Copper Ridge fires merged, and the North <br />
Fork and Little Chill fires merged. The two fires are now known as Copper Lake and Little Chill fires, respectively. The Silesia Fire had <br />
significant growth and is approximately one mile from the forest boundary with the Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest. This fire <br />
activity has prompted the closure of the Silesia Creek Trail. The Chilliwack Complex is made up of several active fires (Little Chill, <br />
Copper Lake, Brush Creek, Silesia, and Little Beaver Creek).<br />
<br />
 Crews continue protection measures on a pack bridge and suspension bridge near the Brush Creek Fire and on the cable car <br />
potentially threatened by the Copper Lake Fire. Firefighters continue to utilize helicopter bucket work on the Little Beaver Creek Fire.<br />
<br />
<br />
The Washington Department of Ecology announced an Air Quality Alert due to current wildfire smoke from the fires in the North <br />
Cascades. North and northeasterly winds are moving into the area, pushing regional smoke impacts from fires into the greater <br />
Bellingham-Seattle metropolitan area. Increasing smoke impacts, reduced visibility and short periods of UNHEALTHY air quality are <br />
expected into Sunday. As southwest winds return late Sunday, smoke impacts will shift back into the Wenatchee, Chelan, and <br />
Okanogan valleys. Take precautions when recreating outdoors when heavy smoke is present. Learn more at Real-Time Air Quality Map <br />
| PurpleAir, airnow.gov or visit https://wasmoke.blogspot.com/.  <br />
  <br />
Trail and camp closures remain in effect due to fire activity. Closure information can be found at <br />
https://www.nps.gov/noca/planyourvisit/trail-conditions.htm  <br />

Due to decreased fire activity, this will be the last daily update. If conditions change, information will be shared via the Crockets Knob <br />
Fire’s Facebook and Inciweb.  <br />
<br />
 Weather: Today will be dry with light winds. Temperatures will be in the low-70s, and the minimal relative humidity will be near 25 <br />
percent. Widespread smoke haze will be visible throughout <br />
the area.  <br />
<br />
Operations: Yesterday two excavators began conducting suppression repairs on the fire. One excavator worked along FSR 4555 and <br />
the other along interior containment lines near Indian <br />
Rock Lookout. The excavators were scattering fuels and constructing water bars. Crews continued to patrol containment lines all <br />
around the fire looking for any remaining heat. For the <br />
foreseeable future, firefighters will continue focusing on suppression repairs, monitoring and patrol along containment lines.  <br />
<br />
Closures and Evacuations:  There are no county evacuation alerts, and County Road 20 (Middle Fork Road) is open to all motorists.  <br />
<br />
The Malheur and Umatilla National Forests’ fire area closure remains in effect for areas east of FSR 45. However, the Forests’ will likely <br />
reduce the closure area within the next day or two. To <br />
stay informed about closure information, please continue checking: https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/malheur/notices/?<br />
cid=STELPRD3845529   <br />
<br />
Smoke may be visible to nearby communities and Forest visitors. Smoke and air quality impacts within the state can be monitored by <br />
visiting: http://oregonsmoke.blogspot.com <br />
<br />
The Malheur National Forest’s Public Use Restriction is Phase C on the Blue Mountain and Prairie City Ranger Districts. No campfires <br />
or personal chainsaw use is allowed. The Umatilla <br />
National Forest remains in Phase B, which allows campfires only in designated campgrounds and recreation sites. For more <br />
information, please go to: <br />
https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/malheur/fire, and  <br />
<br />
https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/umatilla/alerts-notices. <br />
<br />
Fire Danger remains Extreme for the surrounding area. The public can help us by making good decisions when they recreate on public <br />
lands and by following local fire restrictions.</span>

Double Creek, Sturgill, Nebo, Goat Mountain Two Fires <br />
<br />
September 15, 2022 <br />
<br />
Daily Update – 8:00 AM <br />
<br />
<br />
Highlights: The Wallowa County Sheriff’s Office rescinded all evacuation levels yesterday after reviewing the increased containment <br />
level on Double Creek Fire, progress made on the fires in Eagle Cap Wilderness, and moderating weather. The thunderstorms, and <br />
associated lightning, that passed through the area on Tuesday resulted in three new fire starts. Initial attack responded to two fires <br />
south of the Double Creek Fire yesterday and one to the north. Pacific Northwest Team 2 is committed to supporting initial attack in the <br />
region and will continue to monitor the area for any new starts in the coming days.  <br />
<br />
<br />
There will be a community meeting to discuss the Double Creek, Sturgill, Nebo, and Goat Mountain 2 Fires on Friday, September 16 at <br />
6 p.m. The meeting will be held at the Joseph Event Center (102 E First, Joseph, OR) and streamed live on Facebook. <br />
<br />
<br />
Double Creek Fire: 157,088 acres | 23% contained |759 personnel assigned  <br />
<br />
The lightning caused Double Creek Fire is a full suppression fire, and the protection of lives and property remain the primary objectives <br />
of this incident. Firefighters working the north end of the fire were busy yesterday responding to a new start. They also worked on <br />
connecting the fire line between Horse Creek and Lightning Creek, down to Dunbar Road, to protect private structures in the area. <br />
Crews continued working on the north end of the fire that spotted over the Imnaha River on September 10. They continue to strengthen <br />
fireline and perform mop up operations. Fire managers are anticipating that the spot fire will be in patrol status soon. Today, crews in the <br />
south will continue working on the Morgan Ridge trail system and work on creating a north-south fireline on Saddle Road. This will help <br />
build additional protection for Imnaha River Woods if the fire were to move further south. <br />
<br />
<br />
Eagle Cap Wilderness Fires  <br />
<br />
There are three lightning caused fires within the Eagle Cap Wilderness. The Nebo, Sturgill, and Goat Mountain 2 Fires are being <br />
managed to protect public and private infrastructure, while playing a natural role within designated Wilderness.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Nebo Fire: 12,563 acres | 0% contained | 90 personnel assigned<br />
<br />
Crews were able to continue chipping operations yesterday after the fire received more than 0.10 inches of rain on Tuesday. About one <br />
mile of chipping still needs to be completed on the 39 Road. The dozer line to the north of the fire and the line to the southeast of the <br />
fire are still focal areas on the Nebo Fire. Crews will work to wrap up the chipping and clean up on 39 Road today and continue to push <br />
forward on the northern and southeastern lines. <br />
<br />
<br />
Sturgill Fire: 20,036 acres | 0% contained | 64 personnel assigned <br />
<br />
Smokejumpers were pulled out of the Sturgill Fire area yesterday with the completion of structure protection efforts. Masticators are still <br />
operating on the Lostine River Road to help strengthen a north-south line that could stop any potential eastern progression of the fire. <br />
The primary work that remains on the Sturgill Fire is the shaded fuel break to the north along Bear Creek Road. <br />
<br />
<br />
Goat Mountain 2 Fire: 535 acres | 0% contained | 0 personnel assigned<br />
<br />
Fire activity on the Goat Mountain 2 Fire is minimal. Firefighters will continue to monitor the fire by air as smoke and weather permit.</span>

<br />
Overview: The Goat Rocks Fire continues to burn 1.5 miles northeast of the town of Packwood, Washington in and around the Goat Rocks <br />
Wilderness area. The fire has been relatively quiet in movement and overall fire behavior. The cooler weather conditions are aiding fire crews <br />
with suppression efforts. Crews are taking advantage of this opportunity to strengthen contingency lines around the fire and enhance <br />
protection measures around structures.  In the wilderness where fire is burning to the southeast in extremely rugged terrain, the self-sufficient <br />
Wildland Fire Use Module (WFUM) is gathering intel and operating within the special limitations (identified within the Wilderness Act) on work <br />
in wilderness area.   <br />
<br />
Fire Activity: Fire crews yesterday continued to utilize heavy equipment and personnel to build containment line along Road 1266-041 and <br />
Road 46. Due to the improvement in the weather, air operations were able to provide support to the southwest edge of the fire within the Coal <br />
Creek drainage. This additional support has kept the fire’s edge from crossing Coal Creek.   Today, fire personnel will continue similar work <br />
with prepping along the 46 and 1266-041 Roads. Crews continue to provide a presence within the Goat Rocks, Timberline, Upper Timberline, <br />
and Grizzly communities and will begin to remove brush piles generated from protection measures. Along the southeast section of the fire, the <br />
WFUM will continue assessing and monitoring the area.  Forest Closures: US Hwy-12 and Highway 123 are both now open for traffic in both <br />
directions, but fire managers are asking the public to exercise caution on the roads as fire vehicles and personnel are operating in the area. <br />
Forest Roads 1260, 1262, 1266, 4600, 4610, 4612, 4830 and all connected spur roads remain closed. Additionally, #65 (Bluff Lake), #69 <br />
(Three Peaks), #74 (Pipeline Road), #61 (Clear Fork Trail from the trailhead to the Clear Lost Trail), #76 (Clear Lost Trail from the junction of <br />
the Clear Fork Trail to the junction of the Packwood Lake Trail), and #78 (Packwood Lake Trail) are closed. Hikers can continue to access the <br />
Clear Lost Trailhead but can only hike south on the Clear Fork Trail.  Evacuations: All of Packwood and its surrounding communities except <br />
for Upper Timberline are at an Evacuation Level 1 (Be Ready). Upper Timberline is now at an Evacuation Level 2 (Be Set).  <br />
<br />
Fire Restrictions: Campfire bans and other use restrictions are in place across the Gifford Pinchot National Forest and much of the region. <br />
Campfires are allowed within certain campgrounds on an approved list at:  <br />
<br />
https://www.fs.usda.gov/alerts/giffordpinchot/alerts-notices <br />
<br />
Weather: A weak cold front will move across the area today bringing autumn-like conditions which are expected to temper fire activity. This <br />
cooling trend is projected to continue throughout the weekend. <br />
<br />
Public Safety:  Increased traffic is expected with upcoming weekend activities and fire personnel continuing to work in the area. Please use <br />
caution when traveling near the area and adhere to the posted speed limits.  Donations: Northwest Incident Management Team 10 would like <br />
to extend to the community a heartfelt thank you for all your generous offers to provide donations to firefighters. Firefighters are well-<br />
provisioned, so we invite you to donate to your local Red Cross, Lewis County Fire District #10 (Packwood) and the Wildland Firefighter <br />
Foundation.  Sign-up For Alerts:To receive alerts from Lewis County in the case of an emergency, please sign up for Lewis County alerts at <br />

Plain, WA – Lightning started the White River and Irving Peak Fires on August 11th. The Minnow Ridge Fire cause is undetermined. <br />
These fires are burning on the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest.<br />
<br />
Suppression Strategy – Due to rugged and steep terrain, fire managers continue to implement a long-term strategy to manage these <br />
fires, including the use of primary and contingency perimeter lines for containment. Tactics include completion and reinforcement of fire <br />
lines utilizing forest roads and constructed hand line.<br />
<br />
Current Situation – A local Type 3 Incident Management Team assumed command of the fires on September 7th and is currently <br />
managing the White River, Irving Peak, Meander, and now Minnow Ridge fires. The Meander Fire remains at 6 acres with very minimal <br />
fire activity. Smoke may be visible over the next several weeks as interior fuels continue to smolder and burn out, and multiple fires burn <br />
region-wide. Updates will be posted weekly unless significant new activity occurs.<br />
<br />
White River Fire – Acres: 3,184 (as of 9/13/2022); 5% contained; Location: Sears Creek area of the White River drainage, <br />
approximately 14 miles NW of Plain, WA.<br />
The fire area remains drier and more active along the southern edges. The fire footprint remains within the control lines, and geographic <br />
features being utilized as containment lines. Firefighters are working to establish an anchor point and maintain the structure protection <br />
along Sears Creek Road and Windmill Lane.<br />
<br />
Irving Peak Fire – Acres: 3,226 (as of 9/9/2022); 5% contained; Location: Approximately 16 miles NW of Plain, WA<br />
The Irving Peak Fire received some precipitation yesterday with minimal growth and fire activity. Firefighters continue to improve roads <br />
used as containment lines and monitor fire activity.<br />
<br />
Minnow Ridge Fire – Acres: 502 (as of 9/13/2022); 0% contained; Location: Chikamin Ridge, approximately 14 miles N of Plain, WA.<br />
Fire activity has been moderate and mainly consuming ground fuels. Firefighters continue scouting forest roads and fire lines previously <br />
utilized during past wildfire activity to determine if they may benefit the current fire suppression strategy.  <br />
<br />
Weather – A chance of showers exists over the fire area today, Wednesday, September 14th, with west winds around 6-8 mph. Cooler <br />
temperatures and higher relative humidity continue into later this week.<br />
<br />
Air Quality and Smoke – Current information about air quality and health recommendations during smoky conditions is available on the <br />
Washington Smoke Blog https://wasmoke.blogspot.com/<br />
<br />
Closures – An emergency closure issued by the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest remains in place and can be viewed here: <br />
www.fs.usda.gov/alerts/okawen/alerts-notices. The PCT remains open and is not directly impacted by these fires. Several trails in the <br />
Chikamin Ridge area are pending closure due to the Minnow Ridge Fire. Fire managers are asking people to please respect these <br />
closures while recreating in the area.<br />
<br />
Restrictions – Campfires are not allowed anywhere within the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest. Stage 2 Restrictions are now in <br />
effect for the entire forest, including campgrounds and wilderness areas: www.fs.usda.gov/detail/okawen/alerts-notices/?<br />
cid=fsbdev3_053600.<br />
<br />
Evacuations – Current Chelan County evacuation levels include a Level 2 evacuation (Be Prepared) for Sears Creek Road and Level 1 <br />
(Stay Alert) for White River Road and Little Wenatchee Road. www.co.chelan.wa.us/emergency-management/pages/active-<br />

						    <span class="textarea">Increased fire activity on some of the lightning caused fires, burning in the very remote, steep, and inaccessible terrain in the northwest <br />
corner of the Pasayten Wilderness Area, spurred trail and area closures over the holiday weekend. Hot, dry, and windy conditions are <br />
expected today as a trough moves into the area which is expected to create conditions for increased fire behavior. The Shull, The <br />
Parks, Kid, Three Fools, Skagit, and Elbow fires, located near the Canadian-U.S border, are expected to grow in acreage today.<br />
<br />
In a joint delegation with the National Park Service, a National Incident Management Organization Team, NIMO Team 2, assumed <br />
command yesterday over the six fires now being called the NW Pasayten Fires, located in the Pasayten Wilderness on the Methow <br />
Valley Ranger District of the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest, as well as the Chilliwack Complex Fires within the North Cascades <br />
National Park Service Complex.<br />
<br />
A number of closures are in effect including an area closure for the Freezeout Creek basin and a number of trails and portions of trails <br />
in the area. Portions of both the Pacific Crest Trail and Pacific Northwest Trail remain closed at this time.<br />
<br />
Smoke from these fires, and other fires burning in the region, may impact north central Washington communities over the next few <br />
days. Take precautions when recreating outdoors when heavy smoke is present. Learn more at Real-Time Air Quality Map | PurpleAir, <br />

<br />
Update on individual NW Pasayten Fires:<br />
•     The Kid Fire, located on the ridge between Rock Creek and West Fork Pasayten, is approximately 8 miles south of the Canadian-<br />
U.S. border. The fire has been very active with spotting and torching of grouped trees. Yesterday, smokejumpers worked on protection <br />
of the historic airport cabin, situated about one quarter mile away from the Kid Fire, utilizing pumps and sprinklers. If conditions allow, <br />
smokejumpers will also be burning out unburned brush between the fire and the cabin.<br />
•     The Parks Fire is also very active. It crossed the border into Canada a couple of days ago. There is a Canadian Incident <br />
Management Team assigned to the Canadian portion (called the Heather Fire north of the border) of the Parks Fire. The fire is about <br />
one half mile from the Monument 83 Fire Lookout at the time of this release. Firefighters have prepared the lookout by wrapping the <br />
base with fire protective wrap.<br />
•    The Skagit Fire, located in Freezeout Creek 6 miles south of the border, spread northward and crossed over the top of the ridge and <br />
down the other side.<br />
•     Three Fools Fire, located 8 miles south of the border, is actively backing down the ridge and through an old burn scar, it has spotted <br />
north of the ridge. <br />
•     The Elbow Fire, located 6 miles south of the border, is actively backing down the slope near Skagit Peak.<br />
•     Tuesday, fire activity increased on the Shull Fire located 11 miles south of the border.</span>

MERLIN, Ore. – Fire personnel and heavy equipment continue to make progress on suppression repair at the Rum Creek Fire.<br />
Most repair work on contingency lines is expected to be completed by Sunday or Monday. Some of the steeper dozer lines,<br />
including on the south side of the fire, will take a little longer to stabilize.<br />
Additional heavy equipment, including a skidder, a processor and eleven excavators, were brought in to help with repair work.<br />
The skidder moves trees cut during fire line construction to accessible locations. The processor strips branches off these trees,<br />
cuts trunks into shorter lengths, and stacks the trees for later removal. The branches stripped from cut trees are scattered<br />
over bare soils to help stabilize soils.<br />
<br />
Excavators have multiple uses during repair work. They dig waterbars, scatter vegetation over bare soils, and move logs and<br />
other heavy debris. In some areas, dozers building fire lines pushed soil and debris down steeper slopes, where it has the<br />
potential to slide into streams. An excavator can reach out and scoop much of this material, pulling it back up the slope to a<br />
more stable location.<br />
<br />
Yesterday, a helicopter reconnaissance flight verified that the fire was not threatening any containment lines. Some hotter<br />
areas were noted, which fire personnel will check today. They will determine if further actions are needed, such as water<br />
drops from helicopters.<br />
<br />
Evacuations: Some areas of the fire are still under Level 2 (Be Set - Prepare to leave at a moment's notice) Evacuation<br />
notices. Please visit: https://rvem.org/ for more information and an interactive map.<br />
<br />
Road Closures: Josephine County Sheriff’s Office has established traffic access points around the fire zone. Only residents<br />
(must show proof of residency) and permitted users will be allowed through. Road blocks are located at:<br />
• Galice Road north of junction with Bear Camp Road;<br />
• Peavine East Road at Bear Camp Road;<br />
• Peavine West Road at Upper Bear Camp Road;<br />
• Quartz Creek Road about 3 miles up (end of County maintenance);<br />
• Stratton Creek Road at Galice Road;<br />
• Hog Creek Road at Galice Road;<br />
• Lower Grave Creek Road at Angora Creek (Grays Ranch);<br />
• Grave Creek Road at the bridge by Grave Creek Boat Ramp.<br />
The Reuben Mountain Road between Lower Grave Creek Road and Dutch Henry Road is open, but grading and other repair<br />
work is obstructing this road. The public is asked to stay off the Reuben Mountain Road until repair work is completed.<br />
Recreation Area Closures:<br />
• Rainie Falls Trail is closed.<br />
• Rogue River Trail is closed from Grave Creek to Russian Creek.<br />
• Rogue River is closed from Ennis Riffle to Grave Creek boat ramp. Permitted boaters can still put in at Grave Creek.<br />
• On the closed section of Galice Road, Smullin Visitor Center, Argo Recreation Site and Boat Ramp, and Galice Boat Ramp<br />
are closed.<br />
<br />
River status: The Rogue River is open to boating down to Ennis Riffle, but closed between Ennis Riffle and Grave Creek boat<br />
ramp. Boats must pull out of the water at Indian Mary or Ennis Riffle County Park. The Wild section of the Rogue River below<br />
Grave Creek will remain open unless fire conditions warrant closure. River status is determined on a day-to-day basis. Please<br />

<br />
Klamath Falls, Ore. – Last night fire crews continued to use infrared cameras to identify areas of heat around the perimeter of the fire. <br />
They are mainly finding heat under juniper trees on the southern and western areas.<br />
<br />
Today is the last day the Oregon Department of Forestry’s Type 1 Incident Management Team will be in command of the fire. Transition <br />
to the local Type 4 team will happen tomorrow at noon. The objectives for the local team will remain the same. Multiple engines and <br />
crews will continue to mop up where it warrants.<br />
<br />
Weather today will be cooler and more humid. Gusty winds are expected in the late afternoon and early evening.<br />
<br />
Residential traffic is allowed in the fire area, but residents are encouraged to drive slowly and be aware of fire operation traffic as they <br />
travel through the fire. Bureau of Land Management lands in and around the fire area remain closed to the public.<br />
<br />
We would like to remind the public that Klamath and Lake counties are still in extreme fire danger. Human-cause fire stats are down this <br />
fire season, so please help your local resources by preventing anything that can spark a fire. Visit <br />
https://www.oregon.gov/odf/fire/pages/restrictions.aspx for fire restrictions in your area or areas you may be traveling to.  <br />
<br />
This will be the final fire update from the ODF IMT. The team would like to thank the cooperators and public for their support during the <br />
fire. Without local resources and support from the community our team would not have been as successful.</span>

September 14, 2022<br />
<br />
Plain, WA – Lightning started the White River and Irving Peak Fires on August 11th. The Minnow Ridge Fire cause is undetermined. <br />
These fires are burning on the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest.<br />
<br />
Suppression Strategy – Due to rugged and steep terrain, fire managers continue to implement a long-term strategy to manage these <br />
fires, including the use of primary and contingency perimeter lines for containment. Tactics include completion and reinforcement of fire <br />
lines utilizing forest roads and constructed hand line.<br />
<br />
Current Situation – A local Type 3 Incident Management Team assumed command of the fires on September 7th and is currently <br />
managing the White River, Irving Peak, Meander, and now Minnow Ridge fires. The Meander Fire remains at 6 acres with very minimal <br />
fire activity. Smoke may be visible over the next several weeks as interior fuels continue to smolder and burn out, and multiple fires burn <br />
region-wide. Updates will be posted weekly unless significant new activity occurs.<br />
<br />
White River Fire – Acres: 3,184 (as of 9/13/2022); 5% contained; Location: Sears Creek area of the White River drainage, <br />
approximately 14 miles NW of Plain, WA.<br />
The fire area remains drier and more active along the southern edges. The fire footprint remains within the control lines, and geographic <br />
features being utilized as containment lines. Firefighters are working to establish an anchor point and maintain the structure protection <br />
along Sears Creek Road and Windmill Lane.<br />
<br />
Irving Peak Fire – Acres: 3,226 (as of 9/9/2022); 5% contained; Location: Approximately 16 miles NW of Plain, WA<br />
The Irving Peak Fire received some precipitation yesterday with minimal growth and fire activity. Firefighters continue to improve roads <br />
used as containment lines and monitor fire activity.<br />
<br />
Minnow Ridge Fire – Acres: 502 (as of 9/13/2022); 0% contained; Location: Chikamin Ridge, approximately 14 miles N of Plain, WA.<br />
Fire activity has been moderate and mainly consuming ground fuels. Firefighters continue scouting forest roads and fire lines previously <br />
utilized during past wildfire activity to determine if they may benefit the current fire suppression strategy.  <br />
<br />
Weather – A chance of showers exists over the fire area today, Wednesday, September 14th, with west winds around 6-8 mph. Cooler <br />
temperatures and higher relative humidity continue into later this week.<br />
<br />
Air Quality and Smoke – Current information about air quality and health recommendations during smoky conditions is available on the <br />
Washington Smoke Blog https://wasmoke.blogspot.com/<br />
<br />
Closures – An emergency closure issued by the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest remains in place and can be viewed here: <br />
www.fs.usda.gov/alerts/okawen/alerts-notices. The PCT remains open and is not directly impacted by these fires. Several trails in the <br />
Chikamin Ridge area are pending closure due to the Minnow Ridge Fire. Fire managers are asking people to please respect these <br />
closures while recreating in the area.<br />
<br />
Restrictions – Campfires are not allowed anywhere within the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest. Stage 2 Restrictions are now in <br />
effect for the entire forest, including campgrounds and wilderness areas: www.fs.usda.gov/detail/okawen/alerts-notices/?<br />
cid=fsbdev3_053600.<br />
<br />
Evacuations – Current Chelan County evacuation levels include a Level 2 evacuation (Be Prepared) for Sears Creek Road and Level 1 <br />
(Stay Alert) for White River Road and Little Wenatchee Road. www.co.chelan.wa.us/emergency-management/pages/active-<br />
