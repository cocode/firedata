<br />
Cloud cover and light rain over the last couple of days have moderated fire behavior. These favorable conditions <br />
have allowed crews on the ground, with continued air support, to make good progress on the fire line. The entire <br />
perimeter has been closed and crews are working to expand the width of the line, extinguish residual heat and <br />
flames, cut snags so they don’t roll downslope taking embers with them, and use bulldozers to straighten the <br />
ragged edge on the east side of the fire. Because there haven’t been more spot fires or breaches of the line, the <br />
Incident Management Team has been able to allocate necessary resources to focus on the active areas of the <br />
fire and strengthen the fire line.<br />
<br />
Those efforts may be just in time. Today some isolated thunderstorms are possible, but they are more likely to <br />
bring gusty winds than rain. By Tuesday or Wednesday next week, warmer temperatures, low humidity, and <br />
gusty winds are likely to create conditions for rapid fire spread. This will be a test of the work that has been done <br />
so far to contain the fire. <br />
<br />
“We’re not nervous about this weather,” said Karen Scholl, Operations Section Chief. “We want this test to <br />
happen to see how our line holds, while we have crews and contingencies in place. We believe we’re in a good <br />
position to be tested.”</span>

Sweet Home, Oregon – Today, the South Cascade Interagency Type 3 Team will progressively increase mop-up <br />
depth. Additionally, they will address concerns related to indirect lines and unburned fuels between containment <br />
lines and the burnt edge of the fire perimeter. They will continue to use hose lays with sprinklers, which has led to <br />
an increase in mop-up effectiveness, especially in areas with a heavy concentration of fuels. Heavy equipment will <br />
be used to prepare indirect lines in preparation for typical seasonal wind events that occur in August and <br />
September. Containment has increased to 65%. The team will continue to decrease in size as more work is <br />
accomplished.</span>

Winthrop, WA — The Cedar Creek and Delancy Fires are burning on the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest <br />
and public and private lands within Okanogan County. These fires are being managed by Great Basin Incident <br />
Management Team 1.<br />
<br />
Fire Information Line - Cedar Creek and Delancy Fires: 509-557-0740 (8:00 am to 8:00 pm)<br />
<br />
Cedar Creek Fire: The fire is currently estimated at 45,719 acres and is 17% contained.<br />
<br />
The Cedar Creek fire became active yesterday afternoon when northwesterly winds pushed the fire southeast <br />
towards Twisp and several communities along the Twisp River. The fire moved around Gobblers Knob and down <br />
Little Wolf Creek towards Pine Forest and Thompson Ridge towards the communities of Poorman and Newbie <br />
Creek.<br />
<br />
The fire breached a primary containment line to the southeast along the 4410 Road.  With help from fire crews <br />
on loan from Cub Creek 2, by working the day shift into the night, and with a break from the wind, firefighters  <br />
were able to hold the breach to approximately 200 acres. Containing this breach is a major focus for today’s <br />
efforts.<br />
<br />
Fire crews created a control feature along the western slope of the Vasiliki Ridge to prevent the fire from <br />
advancing by tying in an avalanche chute and rock scree field. The intent is to keep the fire on the east side of <br />
WA-20.<br />
<br />
Work along the WA-20 Corridor continued with firefighters mopping up and scouting to ensure that hot spots near <br />
structures were located and extinguished. A concentrated effort is being made to achieve containment along WA-<br />
20 and make it possible to repopulate the area.<br />
<br />
Additional evacuations were ordered for residents of the Twisp River Valley from Poorman Creek Road to the <br />
Buttermilk area. For more information on evacuation status, please visit the Okanogan County Emergency <br />
Management’s interactive map page at: https://bit.ly/CedarCreekEvac<br />
<br />
Multiple strike teams of state and local engines (state mobilization) continued with structure protection and <br />
patrolled homes along the fire perimeter. Volunteer and career firefighters from Okanogan County Fire District 6 <br />
mobilized to assist with evacuations and paroled resident’s properties through the night to provide structure <br />
protection.<br />
<br />
Delancy Fire: Last night the Delancy fire remained within its current perimeter. Fire crews working in the Vasiliki <br />

Inchelium, Wa. – Changing weather conditions may moderate fire behavior on the Summit Trail Fire today as <br />
potential rain and thunderstorms move into the fire area. Accompanying those storms will be erratic and gusty <br />
winds, which could bring gusts of up to 40 mph. Still, with temperatures expected to be 10-15 degrees cooler <br />
today than yesterday, fire crews are anticipating diminished fire activity in certain parts of the fire, which will allow <br />
them to continue their work to contain the fire as small as possible. Where direct line isn’t feasible, crews are <br />
scouting and establishing contingency lines to both the east and west of the fire, with both hand crews and heavy <br />
machinery working in cooperation to establish these lines.<br />
<br />
A majority of the fire’s growth yesterday, just under 2,000 acres, occurred to the northwest; overall containment <br />
remains at 12%.<br />
<br />
Structure and contingency groups near Twin Lakes are building containment lines and strengthening defensible <br />
space around structures should the fire progress beyond containment lines in Beaver Dam Creek drainage.<br />
<br />
The Incident Management Team is also managing the Chuweah Creek Fire, where patrol and mop up continues.<br />
<br />
Evacuations: No Change. Level 1 (Advisory) evacuations are in place for the area from Lafleur south on Hall <br />
Creek Road to Hall Creek Flat (including Lynx Creek Road), Seyler Valley Road south to Bridge Creek Road, <br />
and for residents along Bridge Creek Road (including Mollenberg Lane) to the edge of Twin Lakes. The Twin <br />
Lakes area remains under a Level 1 (Advisory) evacuation as well. A map of the evacuation area is available at <br />
incidweb.nwcg.gov/incidents/7677.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Boating Exclusion: North Twin Lake and the channel are closed to boating. South Twin Lake remains open.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Road closures: Sitdown Creek Road is closed at County Highway 99. Motorists can expect one-way, controlled <br />
traffic along Bridge Creek Road from approximately 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. between Carson Beach and Beaver Dam <br />
Creek. Some recreation and parking areas may be closed to public access. Expect delays and please use <br />
caution when driving as firefighters will be working along the road.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Closures: The Reservation is shut down to industrial activities and the general public. The Tribes have imposed <br />
an Industrial Fire Precaution Level IV general shutdown, which closes all forest roads to the public. State and <br />
county improved roads (with a paved or gravel surface) remain open.<br />

[John Day, Ore.]  Overnight the Cottonwood Creek Fire remained within the established firelines.  Light <br />
precipitation fell across the fire but was not enough to impact fire fighting activity today.  On Saturday the fire was <br />
mapped at 159 acres with 10% containment.  The increased size is due to improved mapping by firefighters, not <br />
from fire growth.  The fire was reported mid-day Friday approximately five miles south of Fossil, burning on <br />
private lands protected by Oregon Department of Forestry’s (ODF) Central Oregon District.<br />
<br />
Firefighters worked Saturday to reduce heat and flames near the fire’s edge and strengthening the dozer line.  <br />
Helicopters were used to cool areas of intense heat, allowing firefighters to break down larger fuels and mop-up <br />
these areas.  Snags within the fire perimeter, especially near the fire’s edge created both a hazard to firefighters <br />
and posed a risk of spreading fire across firelines into unburned fuels.  Firefighters focused on falling these <br />
snags Saturday.  A few minor slopovers occurred due to rolling burning material in steep terrain and embers from <br />
falling snags.  Firefighters were able to quickly build fireline around these areas and mop-up any heat in the area.<br />
<br />
Today firefighters will be working to increase the area of cold black between the dozer line and areas of heat or <br />
flame.  They will be focusing in the areas of timber and heavier fuels which typically hold fire longer.  Firefighters <br />
will use tenders and hoselays to distribute water around the fire area to use in this mop-up work.  A hoselay <br />
allows firefighters to pump water from an engine or portable tank through a series of hoses to efficiently provide <br />
water to all parts of the fire.  <br />

The fire is being managed by a Type 3 organization from ODF’s Central Oregon District. Twelve wildland <br />
engines, five hand crews, three water tenders, a dozer, and additional overhead are assigned to the fire.  Local <br />
aircraft are available as need to support firefighting activities.<br />
<br />
A Regulated-Use Closure is in effect for the Central Oregon District to reduce human caused fires.  The closure <br />
restricts mowing of dried grass, cutting and grinding of metal, and chainsaw use between 10:00 a.m. and 8:00 <br />
p.m. as well as prohibiting campfires, cooking fires and warming fires.  The full proclamation and restrictions are <br />
available at https://gisapps.odf.oregon.gov/firerestrictions/PFR.html.  Industrial operations on forestland within <br />
the Central Oregon District also have restrictions in place.  Details for these activities are found at <br />
https://gisapps.odf.oregon.gov/firerestrictions/IFPL.html.  Preventing human caused fires allows firefighters to <br />
focus suppression effort on fires started by lightning.  These focused activities result in smaller fires with less <br />
damage to natural resources and communities and fewer impacts to air quality.<br />

<br />
Yesterday firefighters were able to successfully complete direct suppression lines with the use of heavy <br />
equipment and hand crews while continuing to secure and mop up hot spots near Vanderpool Crossing. <br />
Firefighters also observed growth along the northwest perimeter as it spread from Doe Creek towards Buck <br />
Creek and Doe Mountain. On the northeast flank resources were engaged around the Brevicomis summer <br />
homes providing structure protection as winds pushed fire further up Twentymile creek past Honeymoon Creek <br />
towards the Chewuch River. Throughout the day aviation operations were hindered over the fire as air quality <br />
and visibility remained poor. Today fire fighters will continue to prep and fall hazard trees along FS road 37 and <br />
scout along FS road 39 in anticipation of easterly growth. Resources engaged at the Brevicomis summer homes <br />
will remain in the area extinguishing hot spots to prevent damage or loss.<br />
<br />
Flash flood watch today until 5:00 pm <br />
WEATHER: Cloudy with periods of showers. A slight chance of thunderstorms during the afternoon. Gusts to 35 <br />
mph near thunderstorms. Additional rainfall amount 0.10 to 0.30 inch, unless thunderstorm brings a direct hit, <br />
with possible 0.50 to 0.75 inch in 30 minutes.</span>

Central Ore. – As expected, containment increased on both the Deep Creek and Johnson Ridge Fires today.  <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Currently, the  Johnson Ridge Fire,  located 9 miles northwest of Shaniko, Ore. that started early Friday morning <br />
remains at  789 acres and is 95% contained. The fire will continue to be monitored  with crews and a water <br />
tender mopping up any hot spots found near the perimeter of the fire<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
The Deep Creek fire started on Thursday afternoon and is located 21 miles north of Madras, Ore. It is <br />
approximately 1,246 acres in size with 85% containment. Priority for firefighters on the fire is  on the thickets of <br />
trees and brush closest to the fire’s edge. The only threat to the fire is anticipated thunderstorms and winds.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Water tenders, engines, hand crews, dozers and a helicopter are all still assigned to the fires to ensure the fires <br />
stay within their footprints. Tomorrow, the Type 3 Incident Management Team will transition back to a Type 4 <br />
Team under the management of the BLM Prineville District in the late afternoon.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
The BLM Prineville District and Bakeoven/Shaniko Rural Fire Protection Association will continue to work in <br />
unified command on the fires.<br />

Winthrop, WA — The Cedar Creek and Delancy Fires are burning on the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest <br />
and public and private lands within Okanogan County. These fires are being managed by Great Basin Incident <br />
Management Team 1.<br />
<br />
Fire Information Line - Cedar Creek and Delancy Fires: 509-557-0740 (8:00 am to 8:00 pm)<br />
<br />
Cedar Creek Fire: The fire is currently estimated at 45,719 acres and is 17% contained.<br />
<br />
The Cedar Creek fire became active yesterday afternoon when northwesterly winds pushed the fire southeast <br />
towards Twisp and several communities along the Twisp River. The fire moved around Gobblers Knob and down <br />
Little Wolf Creek towards Pine Forest and Thompson Ridge towards the communities of Poorman and Newbie <br />
Creek.<br />
<br />
The fire breached a primary containment line to the southeast along the 4410 Road.  With help from fire crews <br />
on loan from Cub Creek 2, by working the day shift into the night, and with a break from the wind, firefighters  <br />
were able to hold the breach to approximately 200 acres. Containing this breach is a major focus for today’s <br />
efforts.<br />
<br />
Fire crews created a control feature along the western slope of the Vasiliki Ridge to prevent the fire from <br />
advancing by tying in an avalanche chute and rock scree field. The intent is to keep the fire on the east side of <br />
WA-20.<br />
<br />
Work along the WA-20 Corridor continued with firefighters mopping up and scouting to ensure that hot spots near <br />
structures were located and extinguished. A concentrated effort is being made to achieve containment along WA-<br />
20 and make it possible to repopulate the area.<br />
<br />
Additional evacuations were ordered for residents of the Twisp River Valley from Poorman Creek Road to the <br />
Buttermilk area. For more information on evacuation status, please visit the Okanogan County Emergency <br />
Management’s interactive map page at: https://bit.ly/CedarCreekEvac<br />
<br />
Multiple strike teams of state and local engines (state mobilization) continued with structure protection and <br />
patrolled homes along the fire perimeter. Volunteer and career firefighters from Okanogan County Fire District 6 <br />
mobilized to assist with evacuations and paroled resident’s properties through the night to provide structure <br />
protection.<br />
<br />
Delancy Fire: Last night the Delancy fire remained within its current perimeter. Fire crews working in the Vasiliki <br />
Ridge – Silver Star Creek area were able to monitor the fire from their location. The estimated size of the <br />
Delancy Fire remains at 223 acres.<br />
<br />
Fire Weather: Numerous showers and isolated thunderstorms will impact the fire area today. Rains could <br />
become moderate to heavy at times. Residents and firefighters should be alert to the possibility of debris flows <br />
from burned areas. Rain will begin to taper off by late afternoon, but the possibility of scattered afternoon <br />
showers will remain.<br />
<br />
Public Meetings: Two public meetings will be hosted by the Southern Area IMT 2 and Great Basin IMT 1.<br />
<br />
Representatives from Southern Area and Great Basin IMTs will provide detailed updates on the Cub Creek 2, <br />
Cedar Creek, and Delancy Fires. Okanogan County Emergency Manager Maurice Goodall will discuss <br />
evacuation status, and spokespersons from the US Forest Service and other community representatives will be <br />
available to take your questions.<br />
<br />
The first meeting will be held Monday, August 2, 2021, at 6 pm in Mack Lloyd Park next to the Red Barn at 51 <br />
State Route 20, Winthrop. The following night, on Tuesday, August 3, 2021, at 6 pm a meeting will be held in <br />
Twisp River Park, 325 North Lincoln Street in Twisp. Both meetings will feature the same speakers and provide <br />
the same information.</span>

<br />
Wallowa, OR – The weather system expected to cross over the Elbow Creek Fire did arrive last night, but the <br />
predicted precipitation amounts did not. The fire area received 1/10 of an inch that was expected to receive up to <br />
¾ inch. Some areas south of Wallowa received as much as one inch of rain. The Red Flag Warning, that was <br />
forecasted to be in effect through today, has been cancelled.   <br />
<br />
On the plus side, the fire’s spread has been stopped, remaining 22,960 acres. Containment has reached 71 <br />
percent.  <br />
<br />
While the moisture has moderated fire activity, that effect will be short-lived as weather is expected to be warmer <br />
and drier over the next few days.       <br />
<br />
With the fire growth essentially in check, work objectives around the entire fire will be similar from division to <br />
division – mop up and deepen the perimeter to mop up objectives. Special attention continues in the Elbow <br />
Creek Drainage and Sickfoot Creek. Work also continues on the north contingency line along the 62 road and <br />
the 6222 Road.  Night operations have been suspended on the south end of the fire.  <br />
<br />
Personnel and fireline equipment continue to be “right sized” to the current fire situation, including the medical <br />
and COVID teams.  Some resources are being released for rest while others are coming in to continue with the <br />
dirty and labor-intensive mop up process. Engines and crews arrived from Alaska late yesterday. <br />
<br />
Evacuation levels within Wallowa County remain unchanged for now. Additional information on evacuation levels <br />
is available on the Wallowa County Sheriff’s Office Facebook page (www.facebook.com/Wallowa-County-<br />
Sheriffs-Office-147212815486187).  <br />
<br />
The Umatilla National Forest remains closed as well as several roads within the fire area. <br />
<br />
Advisory: A virtual community meeting will take place over Facebook Live at 7:00 pm Monday evening. The <br />
Incident Management Team will provide a final update of the fire and share information on handing the fire over <br />
to a smaller Type 3 organization. Facebook Live Meeting Link: https://fb.me/e/4jEt5P5jL</span>

<br />
Lick Creek Fire: The fire area received 0.12" of rainfall yesterday aiding in firefighting efforts. A small, 6-acre, <br />
spot fire was fought aggressively and quickly contained. Crews will continue to mop up pockets of heat interior <br />
and patrol the perimeter until full containment is achieved. A Burned Area Emergency Response team continues <br />
its efforts for the fire. The team’s work will allow for long-range forecasting and preparation of mitigation <br />
measures in areas where the risk of runoff and flooding can take place.<br />
<br />
Green Ridge Fire: Firefighters contained a twenty-two-acre spot fire on the west side of the 46 Road about two <br />
miles north of Godman Trailhead. Every effort is being made to protect the numerous values at risk to include Mill <br />
Creek Municipal Watershed, plantation reforestation sites, sensitive plants, recreation areas, fisheries, numerous <br />
cultural, archaeological, and historic sites, farming, high value agricultural lands, a RAWS site, and a repeater <br />
site are also threatened. Secondary control lines are also being established by improvement of existing roads, <br />
trails, and natural terrain features. Structure defense activities, including the use of protective fire wrap on the <br />
Historic Godman Guard Station and Fire Lookout were accomplished yesterday.<br />
<br />
Firefighters continue working the strategy of the 'anchor and flanking', using the northwest portion of the fire as <br />
the anchor and constructing containment lines from that area along the north and west perimeter of the fire. Less <br />
active areas along the perimeter allow for placement of containment lines immediately adjacent to the fire <br />
perimeter. Areas unsafe for personnel to access or lack of personnel require burning out fuel between the main <br />
fire and containment lines.<br />
Cloud cover and rainfall (measured at 0.05 by portable weather station) helped moderate fire activity yesterday. <br />
Air and ground resources are being used to minimize potential for additional fire spread, constructing direct <br />
containment lines where safe to do so. Contingency planning and implementation are ongoing with support from <br />
Regional Fire Managers. Over the last two days, additional resources arrived to provide enough personnel to <br />
staff a night shift. More fire crews and engines are still on order but due to several active wildfires in the west <br />
their availability is limited.<br />
<br />
Weather and Smoke Information: This morning’s cloud cover will lift leading to increasing instability as the day <br />
progresses. The instability could bring thunderstorms that produce light and variable winds (5-10 MPH with a <br />
shift from the northwest in the afternoon) and scattered showers. The region can expect smoky conditions and <br />
elevated humidity levels. Information is available on Washington Smoke Blog at: https://wasmoke.blogspot.com/.<br />
<br />
Closures: All Forest Service lands, roads, and trails in the Umatilla National Forest are closed. For more <br />
information, visit the Umatilla National Forest website: <br />

<br />
The Southern Area Incident Management Gray Team, led by Incident Commander Mitch Ketron, assumed <br />
command of the fire on July 25, 2021. Multiple resources are responding to the fire. The cause of the fire is <br />
under investigation.<br />
<br />
Advisories:<br />
<br />
Do not fly drones over the fire. If you fly, we can't.<br />
Please respect road closure. Traffic on closed roads creates safety hazards for firefighters and emergency <br />
vehicles.<br />
Firefighting resources are extremely limited. It is critically important that we all do our part to prevent additional <br />
fire starts by following all restrictions and fire-related closures.</span>

<br />
Fire Information: As of Sunday, August 1, the Jack Fire has burned 23,004 acres and is 75 percent contained. It <br />
is currently most active south of Hwy 138 in the east, southeast, and south flank of the fire. Crews there are <br />
conducting firefighting operations as conditions allow, including at the 4770 road, on the 28 road, along the 530 <br />
road to Twin Lakes, and near Calf Creek. As burn operations occur, please be aware smoke may be visible to the <br />
public. North of Hwy 138, firefighters are successfully holding control lines and continuing mop-up operations, <br />
patrol and monitoring activity on the northeast, north, and west perimeters of the fire.<br />
<br />
Multiple small fire starts have recently ignited in a remote location at the Upper Steamboat Creek Drainage, <br />
following lightning storms that passed through that vicinity. Management of these new fire starts north of the Jack <br />
Fire has been combined and named the Rough Patch Complex. There are approximately 22 new starts burning <br />
about 240 acres. As of 7:00 a.m. this morning, Northwest Team 13, under the leadership of Brian Gales, has <br />
assumed command of the Rough Patch Complex. Today the new resources for the Rough Patch Complex will be <br />
working on the 650 and 651 roads and scouting for potential containment lines and opportunities for suppression. <br />
Crews will be assisted by firefighters from the Umpqua National Forest and the Douglas Fire Protection <br />
Association. The Rough Patch Complex is burning in an area of limited access, narrow roads, steep terrain, and <br />
high fuel loads, which will present a challenge for suppression operations.<br />
<br />
Structures: Firefighter presence continues within Dry Creek patrolling and monitoring the area.<br />
<br />
Aviation: A heavy Type I helicopter with bucket recently joined two heavy Type I helicopters with buckets, one <br />
heavy Type I helicopter with a tank, and one light Type III that were already assigned to the Jack Fire. All five <br />
helicopters are now supporting air operations for both the Jack Fire and the Rough Patch Complex. A Temporary <br />
Flight Restriction (TFR) has been established over the Jack Fire and Rough Patch Complex to protect aircraft <br />
working on firefighting operations. All unauthorized aircraft, including drones, are prohibited from flying over the <br />
fire, as they can interfere with authorized air support operations. Please do not use drones or any other restricted <br />
aircraft listed near the fire as it is a federal crime.<br />
<br />
Safety: Our primary mission continues to be managing wildfires, taking care of the community, and meeting the <br />
objectives identified by the agency administrators. Additionally, protecting the community and our firefighters from <br />
contagious diseases, such as COVID-19, is also a priority. COVID precautions and procedures have been <br />
implemented to ensure the safety and health of all fire personnel and the community we serve. Our staff will be <br />
continually monitored to ensure protection measures are effective and in alignment with the primary objectives of <br />
protection from wildfire.<br />
<br />
Closures: The Umpqua National Forest’s Horseshoe Bend Campground remains closed to ensure the safety of <br />
the public. Visitors can call the North Umpqua Ranger Station at 541-496-3532 for details on whether additional <br />
national forest sites and facilities near the Jack Fire are open.<br />
<br />
Evacuations: As designated by the Douglas County Sheriff's Office, the current evacuation levels remain the <br />
same. A current evacuation map can be found at www.dcso.com/evacuations.</span>

Central Ore. – As expected, containment increased on both the Deep Creek and Johnson Ridge Fires today.  <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Currently, the  Johnson Ridge Fire,  located 9 miles northwest of Shaniko, Ore. that started early Friday morning <br />
remains at  789 acres and is 95% contained. The fire will continue to be monitored  with crews and a water <br />
tender mopping up any hot spots found near the perimeter of the fire<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
The Deep Creek fire started on Thursday afternoon and is located 21 miles north of Madras, Ore. It is <br />
approximately 1,246 acres in size with 85% containment. Priority for firefighters on the fire is  on the thickets of <br />
trees and brush closest to the fire’s edge. The only threat to the fire is anticipated thunderstorms and winds.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Water tenders, engines, hand crews, dozers and a helicopter are all still assigned to the fires to ensure the fires <br />
stay within their footprints. Tomorrow, the Type 3 Incident Management Team will transition back to a Type 4 <br />
Team under the management of the BLM Prineville District in the late afternoon.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />

<br />
Lick Creek Fire: The fire area received 0.12" of rainfall yesterday aiding in firefighting efforts. A small, 6-acre, <br />
spot fire was fought aggressively and quickly contained. Crews will continue to mop up pockets of heat interior <br />
and patrol the perimeter until full containment is achieved. A Burned Area Emergency Response team continues <br />
its efforts for the fire. The team’s work will allow for long-range forecasting and preparation of mitigation <br />
measures in areas where the risk of runoff and flooding can take place.<br />
<br />
Green Ridge Fire: Firefighters contained a twenty-two-acre spot fire on the west side of the 46 Road about two <br />
miles north of Godman Trailhead. Every effort is being made to protect the numerous values at risk to include Mill <br />
Creek Municipal Watershed, plantation reforestation sites, sensitive plants, recreation areas, fisheries, numerous <br />
cultural, archaeological, and historic sites, farming, high value agricultural lands, a RAWS site, and a repeater <br />
site are also threatened. Secondary control lines are also being established by improvement of existing roads, <br />
trails, and natural terrain features. Structure defense activities, including the use of protective fire wrap on the <br />
Historic Godman Guard Station and Fire Lookout were accomplished yesterday.<br />
<br />
Firefighters continue working the strategy of the 'anchor and flanking', using the northwest portion of the fire as <br />
the anchor and constructing containment lines from that area along the north and west perimeter of the fire. Less <br />
active areas along the perimeter allow for placement of containment lines immediately adjacent to the fire <br />
perimeter. Areas unsafe for personnel to access or lack of personnel require burning out fuel between the main <br />
fire and containment lines.<br />
Cloud cover and rainfall (measured at 0.05 by portable weather station) helped moderate fire activity yesterday. <br />
Air and ground resources are being used to minimize potential for additional fire spread, constructing direct <br />
containment lines where safe to do so. Contingency planning and implementation are ongoing with support from <br />
Regional Fire Managers. Over the last two days, additional resources arrived to provide enough personnel to <br />
staff a night shift. More fire crews and engines are still on order but due to several active wildfires in the west <br />
their availability is limited.<br />
<br />
Weather and Smoke Information: This morning’s cloud cover will lift leading to increasing instability as the day <br />
progresses. The instability could bring thunderstorms that produce light and variable winds (5-10 MPH with a <br />
shift from the northwest in the afternoon) and scattered showers. The region can expect smoky conditions and <br />
elevated humidity levels. Information is available on Washington Smoke Blog at: https://wasmoke.blogspot.com/.<br />
<br />
Closures: All Forest Service lands, roads, and trails in the Umatilla National Forest are closed. For more <br />
information, visit the Umatilla National Forest website: <br />

<br />
The Nelson Creek Fire started on Friday, July 23, 2021. The fire was a result of a structure fire that burned <br />
quickly upslope and into the adjacent wildlands. The Southern Area Incident Management Gray Team, led by <br />
Incident Commander Mitch Ketron, assumed command of the fire on July 23, 2021. <br />
<br />
Advisories<br />
<br />
Do not fly drones over the fire. If you fly, we can't.<br />
Please respect road closure. Traffic on closed roads creates safety hazards for firefighters and emergency <br />
vehicles.<br />
Firefighting resources are extremely limited. It is critically important that we all do our part to prevent additional <br />
fire starts by following all restrictions and fire-related closures.</span>

						    <span class="textarea">Fire Information: As of Sunday, August 1, the Jack Fire has burned 23,004 acres and is 75 percent contained. It <br />
is currently most active south of Hwy 138 in the east, southeast, and south flank of the fire. Crews there are <br />
conducting firefighting operations as conditions allow, including at the 4770 road, on the 28 road, along the 530 <br />
road to Twin Lakes, and near Calf Creek. As burn operations occur, please be aware smoke may be visible to the <br />
public. North of Hwy 138, firefighters are successfully holding control lines and continuing mop-up operations, <br />
patrol and monitoring activity on the northeast, north, and west perimeters of the fire.<br />
<br />
Multiple small fire starts have recently ignited in a remote location at the Upper Steamboat Creek Drainage, <br />
following lightning storms that passed through that vicinity. Management of these new fire starts north of the Jack <br />
Fire has been combined and named the Rough Patch Complex. There are approximately 22 new starts burning <br />
about 240 acres. As of 7:00 a.m. this morning, Northwest Team 13, under the leadership of Brian Gales, has <br />
assumed command of the Rough Patch Complex. Today the new resources for the Rough Patch Complex will be <br />
working on the 650 and 651 roads and scouting for potential containment lines and opportunities for suppression. <br />
Crews will be assisted by firefighters from the Umpqua National Forest and the Douglas Fire Protection <br />
Association. The Rough Patch Complex is burning in an area of limited access, narrow roads, steep terrain, and <br />
high fuel loads, which will present a challenge for suppression operations.<br />
<br />
Structures: Firefighter presence continues within Dry Creek patrolling and monitoring the area.<br />
<br />
Aviation: A heavy Type I helicopter with bucket recently joined two heavy Type I helicopters with buckets, one <br />
heavy Type I helicopter with a tank, and one light Type III that were already assigned to the Jack Fire. All five <br />
helicopters are now supporting air operations for both the Jack Fire and the Rough Patch Complex. A Temporary <br />
Flight Restriction (TFR) has been established over the Jack Fire and Rough Patch Complex to protect aircraft <br />
working on firefighting operations. All unauthorized aircraft, including drones, are prohibited from flying over the <br />
fire, as they can interfere with authorized air support operations. Please do not use drones or any other restricted <br />
aircraft listed near the fire as it is a federal crime.<br />
<br />
Safety: Our primary mission continues to be managing wildfires, taking care of the community, and meeting the <br />
objectives identified by the agency administrators. Additionally, protecting the community and our firefighters from <br />
contagious diseases, such as COVID-19, is also a priority. COVID precautions and procedures have been <br />
implemented to ensure the safety and health of all fire personnel and the community we serve. Our staff will be <br />
continually monitored to ensure protection measures are effective and in alignment with the primary objectives of <br />
protection from wildfire.</span>

<br />
Wellpinit, WA –  Yesterday, crews effectively contained an 11-acre spot fire that had smoldered through a root <br />
system and reemerged above ground, away from its original ignition point outside of containment lines.  An <br />
infrared flight was done last night and a reconnaissance flight will be done today to monitor for any other areas of <br />
heat.<br />
<br />
Firefighters are mopping up the spot fire today, and unneeded crews are being released.  Much of the lines are <br />
mopped up 100-150 feet deep along the perimeter.  Night operations ended last night.<br />
<br />
With a heat advisory in effect through Saturday and record-setting dry fuels, firefighters will monitor for any other <br />

Summer School at Wellpinit High/Middle School is cancelled this week (7/26/21 - 7/30/21).Wellpinit, WA – Fire <br />
containment is at 85% including the spot to the north west of the fire perimeter.  Acres remain unchanged. A <br />
palm-infrared operator is walking the fire perimeter, checking for remaining areas of heat as a final step in the <br />
containment assessment process. This is expected to take another day. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
A low-pressure weather system that moved into the area last night and this morning is likely to produce scattered <br />
wetting rain and has the potential for thunderstorms. Gusty outflow winds up to 35 mph are possible, increasing <br />
the chance for new fire starts and blow down. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
The Spokane Indian Reservation is in EXTREME fire danger. You can help firefighters prevent wildfires by <br />
checking the tire pressure of your vehicle, and ensuring it is clear of debris under the carriage before driving. <br />
Doing so can prevent accidents and wildfires.  <br />

<br />
Colville, WA: Yesterday: Alpha Division (north of Highway 20) was turned back over to the local agency, DNR. <br />
Confidence is high that all hot spots have been addressed and mitigated. Repair work is now signed off and <br />
marked complete. Firefighters on Division Zulu (south side of Highway 20) continued with their mop up <br />
operations which included gridding the fire to look for hot spots and making sure everything is out and cooled off. <br />
Palm infrared tools are being used to point out any additional hot spots firefighters can’t see with the naked eye. <br />
Containment was achieved for 65% of the 130 acres fire. All evacuation notices are now lifted for the area. <br />
<br />
Today: Firefighters will continue to patrol Division Alpha, but no crews are assigned since the home agency has <br />
taken back over that area. Division Zulu will continue securing the containment line on the south end. They will <br />
continue repair work and  the chipping operation. Repair work is part of our turn back standards (turning the fire <br />
back to local resources). This includes repairing any fences, roads or anything else that was destroyed during <br />
the firefighting efforts for access or containment during initial attack. Road repair on Olson Road will continue <br />
with the tender and grader. There are 157 firefighters on the ground with heavy equipment assisting with repair <br />
and contingency lines.<br />
 <br />
Resources will continue the demobilization process to return home or to be allocated to another fire today as <br />
containment continues to progress. <br />
<br />
Signs are on the highway informing drivers about firefighting vehicles coming on and off the highway. Citizens <br />
are asked to stay clear of the fire area and adhere to road signs. Driving with care will keep both drivers and <br />
firefighters safe. <br />
<br />
While we appreciate the outpouring of generosity, there are no current needs for donations for the firefighting <br />
efforts.  Individuals who want to donate items should contact their local food pantries or local charities.<br />
<br />

winds, which could bring gusts of up to 40 mph. Still, with temperatures expected to be 10-15 degrees cooler <br />
today than yesterday, fire crews are anticipating diminished fire activity in certain parts of the fire, which will allow <br />
them to continue their work to contain the fire as small as possible. Where direct line isn’t feasible, crews are <br />
scouting and establishing contingency lines to both the east and west of the fire, with both hand crews and heavy <br />
machinery working in cooperation to establish these lines.<br />
<br />
A majority of the fire’s growth yesterday, just under 2,000 acres, occurred to the northwest; overall containment <br />
remains at 12%.<br />
<br />
Structure and contingency groups near Twin Lakes are building containment lines and strengthening defensible <br />
space around structures should the fire progress beyond containment lines in Beaver Dam Creek drainage.<br />
<br />
The Incident Management Team is also managing the Chuweah Creek Fire, where patrol and mop up continues.<br />
<br />
<br />
Evacuations: No Change. Level 1 (Advisory) evacuations are in place for the area from Lafleur south on Hall <br />
Creek Road to Hall Creek Flat (including Lynx Creek Road), Seyler Valley Road south to Bridge Creek Road, <br />
and for residents along Bridge Creek Road (including Mollenberg Lane) to the edge of Twin Lakes. The Twin <br />
Lakes area remains under a Level 1 (Advisory) evacuation as well. A map of the evacuation area is available at <br />
incidweb.nwcg.gov/incidents/7677.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Boating Exclusion: North Twin Lake and the channel are closed to boating. South Twin Lake remains open.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Road closures: Sitdown Creek Road is closed at County Highway 99. Motorists can expect one-way, controlled <br />
traffic along Bridge Creek Road from approximately 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. between Carson Beach and Beaver Dam <br />
Creek. Some recreation and parking areas may be closed to public access. Expect delays and please use <br />
caution when driving as firefighters will be working along the road.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Closures: The Reservation is shut down to industrial activities and the general public. The Tribes have imposed <br />
an Industrial Fire Precaution Level IV general shutdown, which closes all forest roads to the public. State and <br />
county improved roads (with a paved or gravel surface) remain open.<br />
