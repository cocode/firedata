<br />
Black Butte Fire information: Firefighters were able to secure black line from the north and along the eastern <br />
edge of the<br />
fire. On the northeast edge, crews will secure and hold alternate lines and continue to prep the 416 road. Along <br />
the eastern<br />
edge of the fire, crews will again utilize air support to limit fire spread east of the North Fork of the Malheur River. <br />
Crews<br />
are putting in direct line from Vale Dip south to the River. Protecting private lands and structures at Flag Prairie is <br />
a<br />
priority. Mop-up will begin on primary lines and crews will patrol and secure spots across containment lines.<br />
Along the southern edge of the fire, crews will hold and secure lines and put in hose lay to the North Fork of the <br />
Malheur<br />
River to control fire spread to the south. Crews will continue to construct primary and alternative lines, and will <br />
begin<br />
mop-up along secure lines along the fire edge. To the west, crews will construct hand line from Crane Creek <br />
Trailhead to<br />
the 832 road and continue prep of primary lines, burning vegetation along the 1420 road as needed to strengthen<br />
containment line. On the western edge of the fire, crews will continue prep along the 16 road, holding hand line <br />
to the river<br />
and burning vegetation to secure that line.<br />
Glacier Fire: The Glacier fire is currently 75 acres and burning in the footprint of the 2019 Cow Fire. Firefighters <br />
continue<br />
to monitor the fire for activity, and reported minimal activity. Steep terrain and hazard trees are safety concerns <br />
for<br />
suppression activities.<br />
Aviation: Air assets include four Type 1 heavy helicopters, one medium Type 2 helicopters and two Type 3 <br />
helicopters,<br />
along with an assigned Air Attack for aerial reconnaissance of both the Black Butte and Glacier fires.<br />
Weather and Air Quality: Critical fire weather. Sunny, hot and dry with temperatures will be in the high 90’s <br />
throughout the<br />
weekend, with northeast winds at 4-8 miles per hour, gusting to 15 in afternoon. Slight chance of showers and <br />
isolated<br />
thunderstorms this evening. There are potential smoke impacts from the Black Butte Fire and others in the <br />
region. For more<br />
information regarding air quality and smoke forecast, please visit Oregon Smoke Blog Spot at<br />
www.oregonsmoke.blogspot.com and Fire Air Now at www.fire.airnow.gov.<br />
Closures: The Big Creek Campground is closed on the Malheur National Forest as of August 8, 2021. For <br />
updated<br />
Forest closure information, please go to the Forest webpage at www.fs.usda.gov/malheur or follow the Forest <br />

(Klamath Falls, OR) – A Type 3 incident management organization will assume command of Bootleg Fire from <br />
the Pacific Northwest Incident Management Team 2 on Saturday, August 14 at 6:00 a.m. In total, eight Incident <br />
Management Teams were assigned to manage the Bootleg Fire since it began on July 6.<br />
<br />
On Thursday afternoon, firefighters and helicopters from the Bootleg Fire provided assistance with two new fires <br />
in the area. The Patton Meadow is approximately 2,000 acres on the Fremont-Winema-Forest west of Lakeview <br />
and the Willow Valley fire is on the Bureau of Land Management’s Lakeview District south of Bonanza at <br />
approximately 220 acres. Both the Patton Meadow and Willow Valley fires have numerous air and ground <br />
wildland firefighting resources engaging, with more firefighting resources ordered. For more information about <br />
the Patton Meadow Fire, visit https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/7798/.<br />
<br />
As the Type 3 incident management organization continues to manage the Bootleg Fire, five fire engines and <br />
additional personnel will remain to patrol the fire area and assist with any new fires in the area. The Oregon <br />
Department of Forestry will assume management of the Yainax and Walrus Fires effective Saturday, August 14 at <br />
6:00 a.m.<br />
<br />
“It has been an honor to work with the local, regional, and national cooperators on this incident,” said Incident <br />
Commander Rob Allen. “We are grateful for the support we’ve received from the local community. Every bit of it <br />
helped our firefighters contain this large fire under challenging circumstances.”<br />

Fire Information Line: 503-668-1437<br />
For Immediate Release<br />
Overview: The Southern Area Incident Management Gray Team transitioned on the Bull Complex Fire at 6:00 <br />
AM, Friday, August 13th. The team will be managing the Janus, Kola, Ridge, Round Lake, and Ogre Creek Fires <br />
that make up the Bull Complex on the Mt. Hood National Forest. <br />
<br />
Current Situation: Weather conditions continue to be hot and dry with temperatures hovering around 100 <br />
degrees with afternoon wind gusts of 15-20 mph along the ridge tops. Very low relative humidity combined with <br />
hot daytime temperatures bring another day of increased fire behavior due to the weather. Emphasis is on <br />
keeping the fire footprint as small as possible, while protecting historic structures such as lookouts and <br />
recreational facilities and natural and cultural resources within the immediate fire area. All the fires on the Bull <br />
Complex have full suppression as the suppression strategy. Wildland Fire Crews continued work on containment <br />
lines along Forest Service Roads 6370 and 4696.  <br />
<br />
Weather - The fire area is expected to reach record-breaking temperatures this week, causing the Weather <br />
Service to issue an Excessive Heat Warning until 10 p.m., Saturday.  Smoke is expected to remain over the fire <br />
area for most of the day and visible throughout the area. During wildfire activity, firefighters can do little to reduce <br />
smoke impacts. Affected communities should remain aware of smoke advisories and conditions. More <br />
information can be found at - www.airnow.gov or the Oregon Smoke Blog - https://oregonsmoke.blogspot.com/?<br />

<br />
Bulldog Mountain Fire: Yesterday with help from heavy equipment and firefighters on the ground good<br />
progress was made strengthening indirect and contingency lines around the fire. Increased fire activity was<br />
observed on all divisions around the fire. Helicopters worked closely with crews on the ground to help cool the<br />
fire perimeter.<br />
Today will be another warm day across the region with poor<br />
humidity recoveries forecasted. Temperatures will be in the<br />
low 90’s on the fire line. Firefighters will continue indirect<br />
and contingency line construction today. Direct fire<br />
suppression will occur in areas that are safe for crews to<br />
engage. Residents around the Bulldog Mtn Fire should<br />
remain vigilant and pay close attention to reliable information<br />
sources for current fire alerts. Citizens are strongly<br />
encouraged to sign up for alerts at Ferry County Alerts.<br />
Motorists traveling on the Boulder Hwy should be vigilant<br />
and watch for heavy equipment and firefighters turning off<br />
and onto the roadway. There are 170 personnel assigned to<br />
the incident. There have been no injuries or structures lost.<br />
Firefighter and public safety is our number one priority.<br />
The Bulldog Mountain Fire started August 5. 2021, located 20<br />
miles north of Kettle Falls. The lightning caused fire spread<br />
quickly due to low relative humidity and unseasonably dry conditions. The fire is burning in heavy timber and<br />
slash. Local crews worked hard the first several days conducting direct fire attack as well as identifying areas of<br />
the fire that indirect containment line is appropriate due to limited access. Multiple aircraft assisted firefighters<br />
on the ground. The fire is currently estimated at 2000 acres with 5% containment.<br />
Mack Mountain Fire: The Mack Mountain Fire started August 5, 2021 and is just south west of the Bulldog<br />
Mountain Fire. The fire is still relatively small (approximately 22 acres) and has had minimal activity.<br />
Residents in the Deadman Creek area may see smoke from the fire. The fire area is located in steep, rugged<br />
terrain with limited to no access. Fire managers are planning for future action when appropriate.<br />
Level 1 evacuation orders and road closures are in place. For current evacuation orders please see Ferry County<br />
Sheriff’s Office Facebook page. Boulder Creek Hwy and State Route 395 remain open. For information on<br />
area & road closures on the Colville National Forest please see<br />
https://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fseprd938379.pdf Citizens are asked to stay clear of the<br />
fire area and adhere to road and area closures.<br />
Northeast Washington Interagency Incident Management Team 2 (NEWIMT2) assumed command of the fire<br />
August 7th at 11:00 a.m. Fire information and the incident command post is located at Kettle Falls High School<br />
in Kettle Falls, WA. Fire information contact is Jeff Sevigney 509 993-2946 or you can also follow us on<br />

Cedar Creek, Cub Creek 2, and Delancy Fires<br />
<br />
Daily Update<br />
<br />
August 13, 2021<br />
<br />
Winthrop, WA —The Cedar Creek, Cub Creek 2 and Delancy Fires are burning on the Okanogan-Wenatchee <br />
National Forest and public and private lands within Okanogan County. As of 6:00 a.m. this morning these fires <br />
are being managed by California Incident Management Team 2 (CIIMT2) under the command of Mike Minton<br />
<br />
Fire Information Line: 509-557-0740 (8:00 am to 8:00 pm daily)<br />
<br />
Fire Weather: Today will be mostly sunny in the morning, becoming partly cloudy. There is a slight chance of <br />
thunderstorms after 1600. Temperatures will range from 96 to 102 degrees in valleys and 81 to 85 degrees at <br />
ridgetops. Relative humidity should be between 15 and 20 percent in low lying areas and 19 to 24 at higher <br />
elevations.<br />
<br />
Cedar Creek Fire: The fire is currently estimated at 54,442 acres and is 41% contained.<br />
<br />
At 6 AM this morning, command of the Cedar Creek and Delancy Fires was transferred from Great Basin Team 1 <br />
to CIIMT2.  Team 2 will build upon the great work done by the previous teams and is committed to maintaining <br />
the positive relationships that exist with the local communities.<br />
<br />
Fire crews have made substantial progress in the Vasiliki Ridge area. Today they will continue to improve and <br />
strengthen control features.<br />
<br />
The perimeter along the WA-20 Corridor is contained from Silver Star Creek, south to Wolf Creek, with the <br />
exception of one section near the Early Winter Campground. A high concentration of standing dead and fire <br />
damaged trees have made it difficult for crews to complete mop up. Sprinklers are being used to extinguish hot <br />
spots by soaking the burned area along the fire’s edge.<br />
<br />
On the southeast end of the fire, the map is now showing containment down the 4410 Road and looping back up <br />
Thompson Ridge along the 040 Road. Firefighters are mopping up dozer line running up Thompson Ridge to <br />
Cabin Creek, down to Sheep Creek, and on to the 4415 Road, and then from Sheep Creek, north up the 4415 <br />
Road along Little Bridge Creek, to the wilderness boundary.<br />
<br />
Today smoke was visible rising from within the fire perimeter. The fire has remained within its current footprint <br />
and acreage remains unchanged.<br />
<br />
Construction of contingency lines in the Twisp River Valley is proceeding. Heavy equipment is being used to <br />
remove ground fuels and to thin trees. When completed, shaded fuel breaks will extend along the north side of <br />
the Twisp River from Deer Creek south to Bridge Creek, from Twisp River north along Canyon Creek and the 050 <br />
Road, and following Bridge Creek to the 092 Road. These lines will give firefighters a good defensive feature to <br />
work from if fire were to come out of the wilderness and move south into the Twisp River Valley.<br />
<br />
Air operations continue at Patterson Lake. The lake is closed, but flights have been disrupted several times by <br />
citizens attempting to access the lake. Being under a working helicopter is dangerous. If you enter the area, the <br />
aircraft will be pulled off for your safety, and work on the fire will be delayed. Please give firefighting aircraft room <br />
to work.<br />
<br />
Delancy Fire:  The Delancy is 223 acres, is being actively monitored, but is unstaffed.<br />
<br />
Resources: Total personnel – 521 firefighters and 154-line supervision and support personnel.<br />
<br />
Cub Creek 2 Fire: The Cub Creek Fire is 66,855 acres and 54% contained. The fire is growing slowly to the north <br />
and west, burning actively both night and day. Dead and downed fuels at the base of Farewell Creek are holding <br />
heat. Further east the fire is flanking above Twentymile Creek. Today firefighters will be addressing hazard trees <br />
that are a threat to the established line. The search for any hot spots near the line will focus on the area of the 51 <br />
Road from Brevicomis cabins to Lake Creek. Suppression repair is also in progress.</span>

Road Closures: We urge the public to stay out of the fire area and please do not go behind roads that are closed. <br />
Fire apparatus and Fire Fighters are on the road clearing snags and putting out hot spots. In many places the fire <br />
has burned to the roadway. For your safety as well as the firefighters please stay out of the area. <br />
<br />
Walker Creek Fire: Firefighters worked through the night to complete structure assessments and clear brush and <br />
debris away from structures. A line has been built across the northern part of the fire but due to weather, spotting <br />
is occurring. Spotting is where the wind carries an ember outside of the fire line and starts a new “spot” fire. <br />
Resources were directed to suppress these spot fires and personnel worked into the evening. Lighter fuels such <br />
as grass will likely facilitate fire spread to the south and closer to highway 20.<br />
<br />
Spur Fire: Yesterday, the Spur Fire moved aggressively to the south prompting evacuations and threatening <br />
highway 20. Numerous spot fires were located and addressed utilizing engines, dozers, and hand crews. Aerial <br />
resources were called in to check fire growth in the most active areas and focus on structure protection. Crews <br />
continued to patrol and address spot fires late into the evening. Today’s activities will focus on structure <br />
protection and patrolling for new spot fires.<br />
<br />
Chickadee Creek Fire: Due to hard work by firefighters and aerial resources along with Engines we can report <br />
that the fire is 40% contained, thanks to the hard work of local fire fighters in conjunction with the work of the <br />
team and aviation resources. Fire personnel continued to improve line, especially in the steep, rocky Wickiup <br />
Creek area. Crews worked on hot spots and patrolled line on the remainder of the perimeter.<br />
<br />
A CLOSURE ORDER has been put in place by the Colville National Forest: Spur Mountain Fire Closure Order <br />

EVACUATIONS: For evacuation information please go to: Okanogan County, WA An Evacuation Center has <br />
been opened at the Holy Rosary Parrish Hall in Tonasket by the Red Cross.<br />
<br />
ROAD CLOSURES: We appreciate all the support from the local communities and remind you that firefighter and <br />
public safety is our number one priority. Visitors to the Forest may see road closures that are in place to protect <br />
the public from firefighting operations.<br />
<br />
Please respect closures and barricades! Know BEFORE you Go! Temporary Flight Restrictions (TFR): There is a <br />
TFR in place for air space over Fire Areas. Remember that temporary flight restrictions also apply to unmanned <br />
aircraft systems (UAS) or drones. If you Fly, We Can’t! <br />

<br />
Inchelium, WA – The command of the Summit Trail, Chuweah Creek and Upper Lime Creek Fires will be <br />
transferred to Northwest Team 10 at 6:00 a.m. tomorrow morning. The new Incident Management Team will <br />
continue providing fire updates and sharing information. All three fires encompass 652 personnel. <br />
<br />
Firefighters will continue to reinforce fire lines around the Summit Trail Fire. Most of the western, southern, and <br />
midway up the eastern flanks are contained with solid fire lines.  Crews will start to retrieve hose lays that are no <br />
longer needed in these areas.  <br />
<br />
Warmer temperatures with low relative humidity will dry out fuels and cause an increase in active fire behavior in <br />
the Summit Trail, Chuweah Creek and Upper Lime Creek Fires. Two slop-over fires near Lynx Mountain in the <br />
Summit Trail Fire were detected on the eastern flank yesterday. Helicopters dropped water on them while <br />
firefighters worked to build a new containment line.  <br />
<br />
Crews will continue to extend and connect hand lines, dozer lines, and secondary lines on the east side of the <br />
Summit Trail Fire. Priority for additional containment on the Summit Trail Fire is the southeast flank in the Beaver <br />
Dam Creek Watershed.  <br />
<br />
The Upper Lime Creek Fire is 382 acres and is 23% contained. Crews will continue to build direct and indirect <br />
line to prepare Highway 21 as a containment line. There will be a single lane closure on Highway 21 starting at <br />
9:00 a.m. with a pilot car directing traffic. Evacuations have been lifted for the Pines north to Bridge Ck. Rd. <br />
<br />
Tomorrow morning command of the Chuweah Fire will return to the Mount Tolman Fire Center.  <br />
<br />
An excessive heat warning is in effect through 8:00 p.m. Saturday, August 14th.  <br />
<br />
Evacuations: Level 1 (Advisory) evacuations are in place from Lafleur south on Hall Creek Rd to Hall Creek Flat <br />
(including Lynx Creek Rd), Seyler Valley Rd south to Bridge Creek Rd, and along Bridge Creek Rd (including <br />
Mollenberg Lane) to Twin Lakes. The Twin Lakes area is under a Level 1 evacuation as well.  A map of the <br />
evacuation area is available at inciweb.nwcg.gov/incidents/7677. <br />
<br />
Upper Lime Ck Evacuations: Level 1: From Empire Ck. to The Pines.  <br />
<br />
Road closures: Sitdown Creek Road is closed at County Highway 99. Some recreation and parking areas may <br />
be closed to public access.  Expect delays and please use caution when driving as firefighters will be working <br />
along the road.   <br />
<br />
Closures: The Reservation is shut down to industrial activities and the general public. The Tribes have an <br />
Industrial Fire Precaution Level IV general shutdown, which closes all forest roads to the public. State and county <br />
improved roads (with a paved or gravel surface) remain open. <br />

Cedar Creek, Cub Creek 2, and Delancy Fires<br />
<br />
Daily Update<br />
<br />
August 13, 2021<br />
<br />
Winthrop, WA —The Cedar Creek, Cub Creek 2 and Delancy Fires are burning on the Okanogan-Wenatchee <br />
National Forest and public and private lands within Okanogan County. As of 6:00 a.m. this morning these fires <br />
are being managed by California Incident Management Team 2 (CIIMT2) under the command of Mike Minton<br />
<br />
Fire Information Line: 509-557-0740 (8:00 am to 8:00 pm daily)<br />
<br />
Fire Weather: Today will be mostly sunny in the morning, becoming partly cloudy. There is a slight chance of <br />
thunderstorms after 1600. Temperatures will range from 96 to 102 degrees in valleys and 81 to 85 degrees at <br />
ridgetops. Relative humidity should be between 15 and 20 percent in low lying areas and 19 to 24 at higher <br />
elevations.<br />
<br />
Cedar Creek Fire: The fire is currently estimated at 54,442 acres and is 41% contained.<br />
<br />
At 6 AM this morning, command of the Cedar Creek and Delancy Fires was transferred from Great Basin Team 1 <br />
to CIIMT2.  Team 2 will build upon the great work done by the previous teams and is committed to maintaining <br />
the positive relationships that exist with the local communities.<br />
<br />
Fire crews have made substantial progress in the Vasiliki Ridge area. Today they will continue to improve and <br />
strengthen control features.<br />
<br />
The perimeter along the WA-20 Corridor is contained from Silver Star Creek, south to Wolf Creek, with the <br />
exception of one section near the Early Winter Campground. A high concentration of standing dead and fire <br />
damaged trees have made it difficult for crews to complete mop up. Sprinklers are being used to extinguish hot <br />
spots by soaking the burned area along the fire’s edge.<br />
<br />
On the southeast end of the fire, the map is now showing containment down the 4410 Road and looping back up <br />
Thompson Ridge along the 040 Road. Firefighters are mopping up dozer line running up Thompson Ridge to <br />
Cabin Creek, down to Sheep Creek, and on to the 4415 Road, and then from Sheep Creek, north up the 4415 <br />
Road along Little Bridge Creek, to the wilderness boundary.<br />
<br />
Today smoke was visible rising from within the fire perimeter. The fire has remained within its current footprint <br />
and acreage remains unchanged.<br />
<br />
Construction of contingency lines in the Twisp River Valley is proceeding. Heavy equipment is being used to <br />
remove ground fuels and to thin trees. When completed, shaded fuel breaks will extend along the north side of <br />
the Twisp River from Deer Creek south to Bridge Creek, from Twisp River north along Canyon Creek and the 050 <br />
Road, and following Bridge Creek to the 092 Road. These lines will give firefighters a good defensive feature to <br />
work from if fire were to come out of the wilderness and move south into the Twisp River Valley.<br />
<br />
Air operations continue at Patterson Lake. The lake is closed, but flights have been disrupted several times by <br />
citizens attempting to access the lake. Being under a working helicopter is dangerous. If you enter the area, the <br />
aircraft will be pulled off for your safety, and work on the fire will be delayed. Please give firefighting aircraft room <br />
to work.<br />
<br />
Delancy Fire:  The Delancy is 223 acres, is being actively monitored, but is unstaffed.<br />
<br />
Resources: Total personnel – 521 firefighters and 154-line supervision and support personnel.<br />
<br />
Cub Creek 2 Fire: The Cub Creek Fire is 66,855 acres and 54% contained. The fire is growing slowly to the north <br />
and west, burning actively both night and day. Dead and downed fuels at the base of Farewell Creek are holding <br />
heat. Further east the fire is flanking above Twentymile Creek. Today firefighters will be addressing hazard trees <br />
that are a threat to the established line. The search for any hot spots near the line will focus on the area of the 51 <br />
Road from Brevicomis cabins to Lake Creek. Suppression repair is also in progress.</span>

TCedar Creek, Cub Creek 2, and Delancy Fires<br />
<br />
Daily Update<br />
<br />
August 13, 2021<br />
<br />
Winthrop, WA —The Cedar Creek, Cub Creek 2 and Delancy Fires are burning on the Okanogan-Wenatchee <br />
National Forest and public and private lands within Okanogan County. As of 6:00 a.m. this morning these fires <br />
are being managed by California Incident Management Team 2 (CIIMT2) under the command of Mike Minton<br />
<br />
Fire Information Line: 509-557-0740 (8:00 am to 8:00 pm daily)<br />
<br />
Fire Weather: Today will be mostly sunny in the morning, becoming partly cloudy. There is a slight chance of <br />
thunderstorms after 1600. Temperatures will range from 96 to 102 degrees in valleys and 81 to 85 degrees at <br />
ridgetops. Relative humidity should be between 15 and 20 percent in low lying areas and 19 to 24 at higher <br />
elevations.<br />
<br />
Cedar Creek Fire: The fire is currently estimated at 54,442 acres and is 41% contained.<br />
<br />
At 6 AM this morning, command of the Cedar Creek and Delancy Fires was transferred from Great Basin Team 1 <br />
to CIIMT2.  Team 2 will build upon the great work done by the previous teams and is committed to maintaining <br />
the positive relationships that exist with the local communities.<br />
<br />
Fire crews have made substantial progress in the Vasiliki Ridge area. Today they will continue to improve and <br />
strengthen control features.<br />
<br />
The perimeter along the WA-20 Corridor is contained from Silver Star Creek, south to Wolf Creek, with the <br />
exception of one section near the Early Winter Campground. A high concentration of standing dead and fire <br />
damaged trees have made it difficult for crews to complete mop up. Sprinklers are being used to extinguish hot <br />
spots by soaking the burned area along the fire’s edge.<br />
<br />
On the southeast end of the fire, the map is now showing containment down the 4410 Road and looping back up <br />
Thompson Ridge along the 040 Road. Firefighters are mopping up dozer line running up Thompson Ridge to <br />
Cabin Creek, down to Sheep Creek, and on to the 4415 Road, and then from Sheep Creek, north up the 4415 <br />
Road along Little Bridge Creek, to the wilderness boundary.<br />
<br />
Today smoke was visible rising from within the fire perimeter. The fire has remained within its current footprint <br />
and acreage remains unchanged.<br />
<br />
Construction of contingency lines in the Twisp River Valley is proceeding. Heavy equipment is being used to <br />
remove ground fuels and to thin trees. When completed, shaded fuel breaks will extend along the north side of <br />
the Twisp River from Deer Creek south to Bridge Creek, from Twisp River north along Canyon Creek and the 050 <br />
Road, and following Bridge Creek to the 092 Road. These lines will give firefighters a good defensive feature to <br />
work from if fire were to come out of the wilderness and move south into the Twisp River Valley.<br />
<br />
Air operations continue at Patterson Lake. The lake is closed, but flights have been disrupted several times by <br />
citizens attempting to access the lake. Being under a working helicopter is dangerous. If you enter the area, the <br />
aircraft will be pulled off for your safety, and work on the fire will be delayed. Please give firefighting aircraft room <br />
to work.<br />
<br />
Delancy Fire:  The Delancy is 223 acres, is being actively monitored, but is unstaffed.<br />
<br />
Resources: Total personnel – 521 firefighters and 154-line supervision and support personnel.<br />
<br />
Cub Creek 2 Fire: The Cub Creek Fire is 66,855 acres and 54% contained. The fire is growing slowly to the north <br />
and west, burning actively both night and day. Dead and downed fuels at the base of Farewell Creek are holding <br />
heat. Further east the fire is flanking above Twentymile Creek. Today firefighters will be addressing hazard trees <br />
that are a threat to the established line. The search for any hot spots near the line will focus on the area of the 51 <br />
Road from Brevicomis cabins to Lake Creek. Suppression repair is also in progress.</span>

***Notice of Public Meeting at the Tiller Volunteer Fire District, Saturday, August 14th, 7:30 PM*** <br />
<br />
***A Red Flag Warning will be in effect today from 2 – 11 PM. *** <br />
<br />
***An Excessive Heat Warning will extend through Saturday for all of southwest Oregon *** <br />
<br />
The Devil's Knob Complex is a group of 40 plus lightning caused fires with the majority burning on the Tiller <br />
Ranger District, Umpqua National Forest with a number of fires burning on private lands protected by Douglas <br />
Forest Protective Association. The fires were started from thunderstorms on July 29th and August 1st. The <br />
Devil’s Knob Complex is situated between the Rough Patch Complex and Jack Fire to the north, which is being <br />
managed by Northwest Incident Management Team 13 and the Skyline Ridge Complex to the southwest, which <br />
is being managed by Oregon Department of Forestry Team 1. The Devil's Knob Complex is managed by <br />
Northwest Incident Management Team 8 from an incident command post at the Milo Academy near Tiller, <br />
Oregon.  <br />
<br />
General Updates:  Progress continues to be made on mopping up of small fires, and portions of larger fires, as <br />
well as containment actions on larger fires within the Complex. Thirteen fires within the Complex are considered <br />
contained, controlled or out.   The priority continues to be taking suppression actions on larger fires that are on or <br />
near private property and homes.  As high priority fires become contained and mopped up in the southern portion <br />
of the Complex, resources will be moved to the central and northern portions of the Complex to other priority <br />
fires. Predicted smoke cover today may temper fire behavior.  However, fire behavior will continue to have the <br />
potential to be very active due to high temperatures, low humidity, low fuel moisture, and potential thunderstorms <br />
that could bring down draft winds and dry lightning. Firefighters will continue to be very vigilant watching for <br />
extreme fire behavior. Air operations over the fire may be hampered today by heavy smoke over the Complex.   <br />
<br />
Evacuations: Douglas County Sheriff's Office has increased the evacuation level to Level 2 “BE SET” for the <br />
following location in the Drew area: All addresses located on Devil's Knob Road.   <br />
<br />
Residents are encouraged to visit the interactive evacuation map at www.dcso.com/evacuations where they can <br />
enter their address to determine what level they may be in. Residents can opt in to receive emergency alerts <br />
based on their address by registering at www.dcso.com/alerts.</span>

<br />
Current Situation: Green Ridge Fire: The Green Ridge Fire grew to 29,759 acres on Thursday and remains 15% <br />
contained. The southern edge of the fire was active near Oregon Butte in Division A and accounts for much of <br />
today’s increase in acreage. Crews successfully completed the firing operations on Thursday in Division M on the <br />
northern edge of the fire. The firing operations removed available fuel between established fire lines and the fire’s <br />
perimeter south of the 22 (4022) in an effort to create a more secure fire line along the northern edge of the fire. <br />
Crews and bulldozers worked to create contingency lines along roads and ridges north of the 22 (4022) Road <br />
yesterday. Fire activity was minimal on the northwest and west sides of the fire on Thursday. Personnel assigned <br />
to those areas continued patrolling lines and mopping up where it was safe to do so.<br />
<br />
Today, crews will be patrolling lines in Division M where firing operations took place, strengthening fire lines and <br />
securing any spot fires that are discovered north of established containment lines. Hand crews and heavy <br />
equipment will continue to be used to secure northern contingency lines above the 22 Road (4022) in Division H. <br />
Resources on the south side of the fire continue scouting locations for fire lines and contingency lines south and <br />
east of the fire in Branch II. Firefighters are looking for roads, ridges, or other natural features that can be <br />
improved to create fire lines in the coming days.<br />
<br />
Current Situation: Lick Creek Fire: The Lick Creek Fire remains 80,421 acres and 96% contained. Crews will <br />
continue to patrol lines and mop up any interior pockets of heat as they can safely do so.<br />
<br />
Weather & Smoke Information: Today’s weather is expected to remain hot and dry, with this weather pattern <br />
continuing through Saturday. Temperatures will be the 90s along the ridges and upwards of 100 degrees in the <br />
valley bottoms. Winds will be light from the northwest at 5-10 mph. Humidity will be in the teens today. Smoky <br />
conditions are likely to persist for a few days until increased winds beginning Saturday. Smoke information is <br />
available on Washington Smoke Blog at: https://wasmoke.blogspot.com/<br />
<br />
Forest Closures: Closures are in place on the Umatilla National Forest. The forest closure for some areas on the <br />
Umatilla NF have been amended. The amended order reopens most Umatilla NF lands in Oregon. The order <br />
also closes all lands on the Walla Walla Ranger District in Washington; forest lands in the Pomeroy Ranger <br />
District will remain closed to entry. The amended order that goes into effect today, August 13th, and is available <br />
at https://go.usa.gov/xFyhn.<br />
 <br />
Evacuations: Garfield County currently has Level 1, 2 and 3 evacuations in place. Level 1 evacuations were <br />
added on Thursday for Grouse Flats in southern Garfield County. For more information on evacuations in <br />
Garfield County, please visit https://go.usa.gov/xFyM4 for full information. Columbia County currently has Level <br />
3, Level 2, and Level 1 evacuations in place. Wallowa County, Oregon currently has Level 1 evacuations in place <br />
for Grouse Flats. An interactive fire map that shows evacuations and other important information is available at <br />
https://tinyurl.com/yv2sypd4.<br />
<br />
Temporary Flight Restrictions: A Temporary Flight Restriction is in place over the Green Ridge Fire and Lick <br />
Creek Fire. Wildfires are a No Drone Zone. If you fly, we can’t. Whenever a drone is spotted near the fire all <br />
aircraft are grounded until we can be sure the drone is clear of the area. For more information, visit <br />

Ground resources continued battling spot fires and holdover ignitions around both fire footprints, as well as<br />
building, holding and patrolling containment lines.<br />
Military support personnel have joined the firefighting efforts, with three wildland firefighting crews from the<br />
Oregon Army and Air Force National Guard deployed to the incident.<br />
<br />
Medford National Weather Service is forecasting a Red Flag Warning for the region today. Highs are<br />
expected to peak around 100° again today, with humidities as low as 10 percent. Temperatures will drop into the<br />
90s for the weekend, reducing the potential for extreme fire behavior.<br />
<br />
Heavy smoke can significantly reduce visibility during daylight hours. Motorists are encouraged to turn on their <br />
headlights and slow down when traveling around forested areas and keep an eye out for engines, heavy<br />
equipment and firefighters on foot.</span>

Kwis Fire: Smoke within the fire area helped to moderate fire activity yesterday despite the extremely hot and dry <br />
conditions. Firefighters worked through the day and into the evening to hold the fire within the primary <br />
containment line. Crews continued preparing fire line south of the fire using existing roads, dozer line, and hand <br />
line from Forest Road 5871 to Forest Road 207, bolstering it with strategic firing operations to remove unburned <br />
fuels between the line and active fire. Today crews will be holding and securing the fire edge and identifying and <br />
developing alternative containment lines further out from the fire, should they become necessary.<br />
<br />
Kwis Fire Structure Protection: Task Force 35 from Clackamas County completed structure and defensible space <br />
prep at the repeater on top of Dead Mountain. Three structures were prepped by clearing vegetation and fallen <br />
debris. Crews dug hand lines around the tower to provide additional defensible space. The Oregon State Fire <br />
Marshal (OSFM) Task Force firefighters were also able to finish evaluating homes for fire safety. To date, OSFM <br />
Task Forces have assessed 399 homes in the City of Oakridge including homes in the Level 2 Evacuation area. <br />
We appreciate homeowners leaving placards in place to assist in the prepping of homes and in the event of <br />
emergency response. Task Force 34 from Linn County worked closely with our wildland firefighter partners to <br />
strategically place three miles of firehose on Forest Road 207.<br />
<br />
Knoll Fire: Crews are working to hold the fire west of Highway 126 and mopping up as needed. Smoke had a <br />
dampening effect on fire activity yesterday. Islands of unburned forest remain within the fire perimeter and will <br />
likely result in increased smoke as they naturally consume. Firefighters will continue to patrol and extinguish any <br />
spot fires that may be caused by embers that may cross the containment line.<br />
<br />
Gales and Ninemile Fires: Work on the Gales Fire continues as crews establish an anchor point on the <br />
northwestern portion of the fire and prepare an indirect line to limit fire spread to the west and north. Crews <br />
maintained the southern edge of the fire where fire activity increased, but remained within the primary <br />
containment line. Additional resources have been assigned to the Ninemile Fire and are assessing and applying <br />
indirect containment strategies.<br />
Weather and Smoke: A Red Flag Warning is in effect for “very unstable conditions” and low humidity. There is <br />
potential for increased fire activity and vertical plumes of smoke, as well as a slight chance of dry thunderstorms <br />
and lightning.<br />
For current air quality information, visit oakridgeair.org/smoke or the Oregon Smoke Blog <br />
oregonsmoke.blogspot.com/.<br />
<br />
Evacuations: Level 1, 2 and 3 evacuation notices have been issued by Lane County. For current evacuation <br />
information and an interactive map of evacuation areas, visit: www.lanecounty.org.<br />
<br />
Closures: Some National Forest System lands near the Middle Fork Complex and Knoll fires are temporarily <br />
closed to provide for public safety.</span>

Current Situation: Green Ridge Fire: The Green Ridge Fire grew to 29,759 acres on Thursday and remains 15% <br />
contained. The southern edge of the fire was active near Oregon Butte in Division A and accounts for much of <br />
today’s increase in acreage. Crews successfully completed the firing operations on Thursday in Division M on the <br />
northern edge of the fire. The firing operations removed available fuel between established fire lines and the fire’s <br />
perimeter south of the 22 (4022) in an effort to create a more secure fire line along the northern edge of the fire. <br />
Crews and bulldozers worked to create contingency lines along roads and ridges north of the 22 (4022) Road <br />
yesterday. Fire activity was minimal on the northwest and west sides of the fire on Thursday. Personnel assigned <br />
to those areas continued patrolling lines and mopping up where it was safe to do so.<br />
<br />
Today, crews will be patrolling lines in Division M where firing operations took place, strengthening fire lines and <br />
securing any spot fires that are discovered north of established containment lines. Hand crews and heavy <br />
equipment will continue to be used to secure northern contingency lines above the 22 Road (4022) in Division H. <br />
Resources on the south side of the fire continue scouting locations for fire lines and contingency lines south and <br />
east of the fire in Branch II. Firefighters are looking for roads, ridges, or other natural features that can be <br />
improved to create fire lines in the coming days.<br />
<br />
Current Situation: Lick Creek Fire: The Lick Creek Fire remains 80,421 acres and 96% contained. Crews will <br />
continue to patrol lines and mop up any interior pockets of heat as they can safely do so.<br />
<br />
Weather & Smoke Information: Today’s weather is expected to remain hot and dry, with this weather pattern <br />
continuing through Saturday. Temperatures will be the 90s along the ridges and upwards of 100 degrees in the <br />
valley bottoms. Winds will be light from the northwest at 5-10 mph. Humidity will be in the teens today. Smoky <br />
conditions are likely to persist for a few days until increased winds beginning Saturday. Smoke information is <br />
available on Washington Smoke Blog at: https://wasmoke.blogspot.com/<br />
<br />
Forest Closures: Closures are in place on the Umatilla National Forest. The forest closure for some areas on the <br />
Umatilla NF have been amended. The amended order reopens most Umatilla NF lands in Oregon. The order <br />
also closes all lands on the Walla Walla Ranger District in Washington; forest lands in the Pomeroy Ranger <br />
District will remain closed to entry. The amended order that goes into effect today, August 13th, and is available <br />
at https://go.usa.gov/xFyhn.<br />
 <br />
Evacuations: Garfield County currently has Level 1, 2 and 3 evacuations in place. Level 1 evacuations were <br />
added on Thursday for Grouse Flats in southern Garfield County. For more information on evacuations in <br />
Garfield County, please visit https://go.usa.gov/xFyM4 for full information. Columbia County currently has Level <br />
3, Level 2, and Level 1 evacuations in place. Wallowa County, Oregon currently has Level 1 evacuations in place <br />
for Grouse Flats. An interactive fire map that shows evacuations and other important information is available at <br />
https://tinyurl.com/yv2sypd4.<br />
<br />
Temporary Flight Restrictions: A Temporary Flight Restriction is in place over the Green Ridge Fire and Lick <br />
Creek Fire. Wildfires are a No Drone Zone. If you fly, we can’t. Whenever a drone is spotted near the fire all <br />
aircraft are grounded until we can be sure the drone is clear of the area. For more information, visit <br />

Kwis Fire: Smoke within the fire area helped to moderate fire activity yesterday despite the extremely hot and dry <br />
conditions. Firefighters worked through the day and into the evening to hold the fire within the primary <br />
containment line. Crews continued preparing fire line south of the fire using existing roads, dozer line, and hand <br />
line from Forest Road 5871 to Forest Road 207, bolstering it with strategic firing operations to remove unburned <br />
fuels between the line and active fire. Today crews will be holding and securing the fire edge and identifying and <br />
developing alternative containment lines further out from the fire, should they become necessary.<br />
<br />
Kwis Fire Structure Protection: Task Force 35 from Clackamas County completed structure and defensible space <br />
prep at the repeater on top of Dead Mountain. Three structures were prepped by clearing vegetation and fallen <br />
debris. Crews dug hand lines around the tower to provide additional defensible space. The Oregon State Fire <br />
Marshal (OSFM) Task Force firefighters were also able to finish evaluating homes for fire safety. To date, OSFM <br />
Task Forces have assessed 399 homes in the City of Oakridge including homes in the Level 2 Evacuation area. <br />
We appreciate homeowners leaving placards in place to assist in the prepping of homes and in the event of <br />
emergency response. Task Force 34 from Linn County worked closely with our wildland firefighter partners to <br />
strategically place three miles of firehose on Forest Road 207.<br />
<br />
Knoll Fire: Crews are working to hold the fire west of Highway 126 and mopping up as needed. Smoke had a <br />
dampening effect on fire activity yesterday. Islands of unburned forest remain within the fire perimeter and will <br />
likely result in increased smoke as they naturally consume. Firefighters will continue to patrol and extinguish any <br />
spot fires that may be caused by embers that may cross the containment line.<br />
<br />
Gales and Ninemile Fires: Work on the Gales Fire continues as crews establish an anchor point on the <br />
northwestern portion of the fire and prepare an indirect line to limit fire spread to the west and north. Crews <br />
maintained the southern edge of the fire where fire activity increased, but remained within the primary <br />
containment line. Additional resources have been assigned to the Ninemile Fire and are assessing and applying <br />
indirect containment strategies.<br />
Weather and Smoke: A Red Flag Warning is in effect for “very unstable conditions” and low humidity. There is <br />
potential for increased fire activity and vertical plumes of smoke, as well as a slight chance of dry thunderstorms <br />
and lightning.<br />
For current air quality information, visit oakridgeair.org/smoke or the Oregon Smoke Blog <br />
oregonsmoke.blogspot.com/.<br />
<br />
Evacuations: Level 1, 2 and 3 evacuation notices have been issued by Lane County. For current evacuation <br />
information and an interactive map of evacuation areas, visit: www.lanecounty.org.<br />
<br />
Closures: Some National Forest System lands near the Middle Fork Complex and Knoll fires are temporarily <br />
closed to provide for public safety.</span>

 Muckamuck Fire Update<br />
<br />
August 13, 2021<br />
<br />
Fire Information: (509) 202-4184<br />
Email: 2021.muckamuck@firenet.gov<br />
<br />
<br />
Start Date: August 4, 2021    Cause: Lightning    Size: 1,648 acres    Containment: 0%<br />
<br />
Location: Approximately three miles northeast of Conconully<br />
<br />
Resources Assigned:  54 personnel<br />
<br />
Current Situation: Crews were able to work directly on the fire’s north and south perimeter on Thursday. They <br />
were aided by multiple helicopters throughout the operational period. Clear skies and moderate winds caused <br />
some active fire behavior in the morning. As smoke from local and Canadian fires settled into the area the fire <br />
calmed down.  As the fire backs slowly down slope the fuel models will change from the heavy dead and downed <br />
fuels. The fire has grown primarily to the southwest and has reached an open grass meadow where spot fires will <br />
be easier to identify and line by firefighters on the ground. <br />
<br />
Today firefighters will continue to go direct on the fireline as conditions allow. Air support will be available to them <br />
as needed. Indirect lines are also being prepped due to the heavy fuel loading and inaccessibility on the east <br />
side of the fire. These lines will provide a contingency should the fire spot over the direct line. The overall plan for <br />
the incident is full suppression to keep the perimeter as small as possible.<br />
<br />
Today California Interagency Incident Management Team 2 (CIIMT2) under the command of Mike Minton <br />
assumed command of the Muckamuck, Cub Creek 2, Cedar Creek and Delancy Fires.<br />
<br />
Weather: An Excessive Heat Warning has been declared through Saturday<br />

						    <span class="textarea">On Thursday, August 12, thunderstorm activity, including dry lightning, in Klamath and Lake Counties resulted a <br />
new large fire that the agencies of the South Central Oregon Fire Management Partnership (SCOFMP) are <br />
actively fighting.<br />
 <br />
The Patton Meadow Fire was reported just before 3:30 p.m. and was caused by lightning. The fire is estimated to <br />
be more than 2,000 acres. It is burning a mile and a half northwest of Booth State Scenic Corridor Park, <br />
approximately 14 miles west of Lakeview.<br />
 <br />
Fire behavior is running and torching in mixed conifer on remote, rugged steep terrain on the Fremont-Winema <br />
National Forest Lakeview Ranger District, as well as on Oregon Department of Forestry (ODF) protected private <br />
lands. The fire moved down the mountain tonight onto the valley floor west of Lakeview.<br />
 <br />
The Patton Meadow Fire has numerous air and ground wildland firefighting resources fighting the fires, with more <br />
resources ordered.<br />
The Lake County Sheriff’s Office of Emergency Management has identified areas for Level 3 (Go Now), Level 2 <br />
(Get Set) and Level 1 (Be Ready) in the fire area.</span>

Ground resources continued battling spot fires and holdover ignitions around both fire footprints, as well as<br />
building, holding and patrolling containment lines.<br />
Military support personnel have joined the firefighting efforts, with three wildland firefighting crews from the<br />
Oregon Army and Air Force National Guard deployed to the incident.<br />
<br />
Medford National Weather Service is forecasting a Red Flag Warning for the region today. Highs are<br />
expected to peak around 100° again today, with humidities as low as 10 percent. Temperatures will drop into the<br />
90s for the weekend, reducing the potential for extreme fire behavior.<br />
<br />
Heavy smoke can significantly reduce visibility during daylight hours. Motorists are encouraged to turn on their <br />
headlights and slow down when traveling around forested areas and keep an eye out for engines, heavy<br />
equipment and firefighters on foot.</span>

Yesterday: Heavy smoke blanketed the Naches River corridor, with little air quality relief throughout the day. The <br />
Schneider Fire experienced intense heat and growth, with torching, crowning and spotting behavior. More fire <br />
response resources arrived throughout the day. Due to smoky conditions, aircraft was unable to assist ground <br />
crews. Crews and dozers continued to build contingency lines where accessible.<br />
 <br />
Today: Additional resources are still arriving at the Schneider Fire in the form of strike teams of engines, <br />
smokejumpers and hot shot crews, with more expected to check-in throughout the weekend. The fire has almost <br />
doubled in size in the last 24 hours, with the majority of growth on the western edge and southwestern flank. A <br />
map of the fire is available at https://bit.ly/SchneiderSpring. A forecasted shift in winds over the next couple of <br />
days is expected to move the fire direction north/northeast/east toward the 410 corridor, and residents can <br />
expect to see an increased presence of fire personnel in and around properties and homes. Extensive smoke <br />
cover is expected to remain in the area. Residents and visitors were urged to be especially mindful of changing <br />
air and driving conditions on Highways 12 and 410, along with an increase in emergency responder traffic on the <br />
roads.<br />
  <br />

CANYONVILLE, Ore.— Firefighters conducted successful burn-out  operations last night to strengthen control <br />
lines on the Poole Creek Fire.  An evening burn out on the fire’s eastern fringe stabilized the Stouts  Creek Road <br />
fire line. There were also burn operations on the southeast  corner of the fire to improve control lines there. <br />
<br />
Operations Section Chief Mike Carlson said the strategy firefighters have  been following this week is working. <br />
“Hard work is paying off. We’re getting closer to pinching this fire off.” <br />
<br />
Overall containment on the Complex has risen to 28 percent. Poole Creek  Fire grew by 696 acres, most of <br />
which was from natural fire growth. It  now stands at 4,361 acres and accounts for 90% of acreage in the  <br />
Complex. The number of personnel has reached 1,257. <br />
<br />
Firefighters today will be cooling heat in burned areas and working to  extinguish any fire starts beyond <br />
established control lines.  <br />
<br />
Thick smoke yesterday again grounded most air operations. Smoke is  expected to lift a bit later in the day, which <br />
could make for more active  fire behavior. Wind gusts along ridgetops will be 15-20 miles per hour. <br />
<br />
Structural firefighters with the Oregon Office of the State Fire Marshal  remain ready near the northern control <br />
line for the Poole Creek Fire.  <br />
<br />
A community meeting will be held jointly with PNW Team 8 at 7:30 p.m.  on Saturday, Aug. 14. The meeting will <br />
be outdoors at the Tiller Fire  Station with social distancing protocols in place.  <br />

Road Closures: We urge the public to stay out of the fire area and please do not go behind roads that are closed. <br />
Fire apparatus and Fire Fighters are on the road clearing snags and putting out hot spots. In many places the fire <br />
has burned to the roadway. For your safety as well as the firefighters please stay out of the area. <br />
<br />
Walker Creek Fire: Firefighters worked through the night to complete structure assessments and clear brush and <br />
debris away from structures. A line has been built across the northern part of the fire but due to weather, spotting <br />
is occurring. Spotting is where the wind carries an ember outside of the fire line and starts a new “spot” fire. <br />
Resources were directed to suppress these spot fires and personnel worked into the evening. Lighter fuels such <br />
as grass will likely facilitate fire spread to the south and closer to highway 20.<br />
<br />
Spur Fire: Yesterday, the Spur Fire moved aggressively to the south prompting evacuations and threatening <br />
highway 20. Numerous spot fires were located and addressed utilizing engines, dozers, and hand crews. Aerial <br />
resources were called in to check fire growth in the most active areas and focus on structure protection. Crews <br />
continued to patrol and address spot fires late into the evening. Today’s activities will focus on structure <br />
protection and patrolling for new spot fires.<br />
<br />
Chickadee Creek Fire: Due to hard work by firefighters and aerial resources along with Engines we can report <br />
that the fire is 40% contained, thanks to the hard work of local fire fighters in conjunction with the work of the <br />
team and aviation resources. Fire personnel continued to improve line, especially in the steep, rocky Wickiup <br />
Creek area. Crews worked on hot spots and patrolled line on the remainder of the perimeter.<br />
<br />

Inchelium, WA – As of 6:00 a.m. today, Northwest Incident Management Team 10, (NWIMT10) under the <br />
leadership of Incident Commander Al Lawson, assumes command of the Summit Trail and Upper Lime Creek <br />
Fires. Management of the Chuweah Fire, now 98 percent contained, was returned to the Mount Tolman Fire<br />
Center today. On Thursday, Highway 21 reopened to two-way traffic. Drivers are encouraged to<br />
exercise caution when traveling near the fire. Warmer temperatures with low relative humidity are drying out fuels <br />
and causing an increase in fire behavior. Despite this, crews are making consistent progress on<br />
containing the fires.<br />
<br />
Firefighters continue to reinforce fire lines around the Summit Trail Fire. Most of the western, southern, and <br />
midway up the eastern flanks are contained. Crews are extending and connecting existing lines to expand <br />
containment. <br />
<br />
The Upper Lime Creek Fire (382 acres), has not grown, allowing firefighters to increase containment to 45 <br />
percent. Firefighters are building direct and indirect containment lines using hand crews and dozers. This work <br />
will help protect Highway 21 and allow them to use the roadway as a containment line.<br />
There are 501 personnel working on the Summit Trail and Upper Lime Creek Fires. An excessive heat warning <br />
remains in effect through 8:00 p.m. Saturday, August 14.<br />
<br />
Summit Trail Evacuations: Level 1 (Advisory) evacuations are in place from Lafleur south on Hall Creek Rd. to <br />
Hall Creek Flat (including Lynx Creek Rd.), Seyler Valley Rd. south to Bridge Creek Rd., and along Bridge Creek <br />
Rd. (including Mollenberg Lane) to Twin Lakes. The Twin Lakes area is under a Level 1 evacuation as well.<br />
Upper Lime Creek Evacuations: Level 1: The Pines (Cache Creek Road) south to Bridge Creek Rd.<br />
Road Closures: Sitdown Creek Rd. is closed at County Highway 99. Some recreation and parking areas may be <br />
closed to public access. Expect delays and please use caution when driving as firefighters will be working along <br />
the roadway.<br />
<br />
Closures: The Reservation remains closed to industrial activities and the general public. The Tribes have an <br />
Industrial Fire Precaution Level IV (General Shutdown), which closes all forest roads to the public. State and <br />
county improved roads (with a paved or gravel surface) remain open.<br />

Road Closures: We urge the public to stay out of the fire area and please do not go behind roads that are closed. <br />
Fire apparatus and Fire Fighters are on the road clearing snags and putting out hot spots. In many places the fire <br />
has burned to the roadway. For your safety as well as the firefighters please stay out of the area. <br />
<br />
Walker Creek Fire: Firefighters worked through the night to complete structure assessments and clear brush and <br />
debris away from structures. A line has been built across the northern part of the fire but due to weather, spotting <br />
is occurring. Spotting is where the wind carries an ember outside of the fire line and starts a new “spot” fire. <br />
Resources were directed to suppress these spot fires and personnel worked into the evening. Lighter fuels such <br />
as grass will likely facilitate fire spread to the south and closer to highway 20.<br />
<br />
Spur Fire: Yesterday, the Spur Fire moved aggressively to the south prompting evacuations and threatening <br />
highway 20. Numerous spot fires were located and addressed utilizing engines, dozers, and hand crews. Aerial <br />
resources were called in to check fire growth in the most active areas and focus on structure protection. Crews <br />
continued to patrol and address spot fires late into the evening. Today’s activities will focus on structure <br />
protection and patrolling for new spot fires.<br />
<br />
Chickadee Creek Fire: Due to hard work by firefighters and aerial resources along with Engines we can report <br />
that the fire is 40% contained, thanks to the hard work of local fire fighters in conjunction with the work of the <br />
team and aviation resources. Fire personnel continued to improve line, especially in the steep, rocky Wickiup <br />
Creek area. Crews worked on hot spots and patrolled line on the remainder of the perimeter.<br />
<br />
A CLOSURE ORDER has been put in place by the Colville National Forest: Spur Mountain Fire Closure Order <br />

EVACUATIONS: For evacuation information please go to: Okanogan County, WA An Evacuation Center has <br />
been opened at the Holy Rosary Parrish Hall in Tonasket by the Red Cross.<br />
<br />
ROAD CLOSURES: We appreciate all the support from the local communities and remind you that firefighter and <br />
public safety is our number one priority. Visitors to the Forest may see road closures that are in place to protect <br />
the public from firefighting operations.<br />
<br />
Please respect closures and barricades! Know BEFORE you Go! Temporary Flight Restrictions (TFR): There is a <br />
TFR in place for air space over Fire Areas. Remember that temporary flight restrictions also apply to unmanned <br />
aircraft systems (UAS) or drones. If you Fly, We Can’t! <br />

(Klamath Falls, OR) – A Type 3 incident management organization will assume command of Bootleg Fire from <br />
the Pacific Northwest Incident Management Team 2 on Saturday, August 14 at 6:00 a.m. In total, eight Incident <br />
Management Teams were assigned to manage the Bootleg Fire since it began on July 6.<br />
<br />
On Thursday afternoon, firefighters and helicopters from the Bootleg Fire provided assistance with two new fires <br />
in the area. The Patton Meadow is approximately 2,000 acres on the Fremont-Winema-Forest west of Lakeview <br />
and the Willow Valley fire is on the Bureau of Land Management’s Lakeview District south of Bonanza at <br />
approximately 220 acres. Both the Patton Meadow and Willow Valley fires have numerous air and ground <br />
wildland firefighting resources engaging, with more firefighting resources ordered. For more information about <br />
the Patton Meadow Fire, visit https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/7798/.<br />
<br />
As the Type 3 incident management organization continues to manage the Bootleg Fire, five fire engines and <br />
additional personnel will remain to patrol the fire area and assist with any new fires in the area. The Oregon <br />
Department of Forestry will assume management of the Yainax and Walrus Fires effective Saturday, August 14 at <br />
6:00 a.m.<br />
<br />
“It has been an honor to work with the local, regional, and national cooperators on this incident,” said Incident <br />
Commander Rob Allen. “We are grateful for the support we’ve received from the local community. Every bit of it <br />
helped our firefighters contain this large fire under challenging circumstances.”<br />

 <br />
Operations<br />
Firefighters successfully held all control lines around the fire during strong north winds and Red Flag conditions <br />
yesterday, limiting fire growth to just 18 acres. The north winds also continued to direct smoke south from fires in <br />
northern Washington and British Columbia onto the Colville Reservation. This smoke over the region from fires to <br />
the north helped to dampen fire activity, but the combined winds and smoke also prevented aircraft from flying <br />
yesterday.<br />
<br />
Last night, firefighters again used the specialized drone for firing operations along the Dan Nason Basin Road, <br />
cleaning up and securing that portion of the fire’s edge. Around most of the fire perimeter, fire crews are working <br />
on mop-up to strengthen the fireline. These mop-up actions will continue for the next several days as crews work <br />
to hold, deepen, and improve the fireline. Mop-up includes extinguishing or removing burning material along <br />
control lines and working to trench logs to prevent them rolling down into unburned areas, which makes the fire <br />
perimeter more secure and reduces residual smoke. Firefighters anticipate very little growth in the fire’s footprint <br />
beyond the current size, and most additional acreage at this point would be the result of limited burning <br />
operations to secure and clean up areas on the fire perimeter.<br />
<br />
There will be increased traffic due to the Omak Stampede this weekend. Please use extra caution driving as fire <br />
equipment accesses the northern portion of the fire from SR155 and will be entering and exiting side roads.<br />
<br />
Evacuations<br />
Level 2 evacuations remain in place for the Columbia River Road corridor, Kartar Valley, Colville Agency, the <br />
community of Nespelem, and the SR155 corridor from Colville Agency north up to the Mission.<br />
Call Tribal Police at (509) 634-2472 with all evacuation questions.</span>

(Klamath Falls, OR) – A Type 3 incident management organization will assume command of Bootleg Fire from <br />
the Pacific Northwest Incident Management Team 2 on Saturday, August 14 at 6:00 a.m. In total, eight Incident <br />
Management Teams were assigned to manage the Bootleg Fire since it began on July 6.<br />
<br />
On Thursday afternoon, firefighters and helicopters from the Bootleg Fire provided assistance with two new fires <br />
in the area. The Patton Meadow is approximately 2,000 acres on the Fremont-Winema-Forest west of Lakeview <br />
and the Willow Valley fire is on the Bureau of Land Management’s Lakeview District south of Bonanza at <br />
approximately 220 acres. Both the Patton Meadow and Willow Valley fires have numerous air and ground <br />
wildland firefighting resources engaging, with more firefighting resources ordered. For more information about <br />
the Patton Meadow Fire, visit https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/7798/.<br />
<br />
As the Type 3 incident management organization continues to manage the Bootleg Fire, five fire engines and <br />
additional personnel will remain to patrol the fire area and assist with any new fires in the area. The Oregon <br />
Department of Forestry will assume management of the Yainax and Walrus Fires effective Saturday, August 14 at <br />
6:00 a.m.<br />
<br />
“It has been an honor to work with the local, regional, and national cooperators on this incident,” said Incident <br />
Commander Rob Allen. “We are grateful for the support we’ve received from the local community. Every bit of it <br />
helped our firefighters contain this large fire under challenging circumstances.”<br />
<br />
