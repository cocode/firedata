<br />
7/21/2021<br />
The weather moderated yesterday with reduced wind speeds, lower temperatures, and slightly higher humidity, <br />
which allowed firefighters to continue constructing and improving firelines. Weather conditions are favorable <br />
again today for the efforts to secure existing fireline. <br />
<br />
On the northern edge of the fire, line was constructed to Long Creek and firefighters scouted a line to tie into the <br />
anchor point near the Sycan Marsh Nature Conservancy. The reduced fire activity yesterday allowed firefighters <br />
to construct dozer line directly against the fire edge along the north and east boundary of the Log Fire. There is <br />
expected northeast movement of the fire toward Winter Ridge and Summer Lake.  Crews and equipment are <br />
going direct while also working to improve contingency lines between the fire and those communities and provide <br />
structure protection for those homes.  <br />
<br />
Firefighters are continuing to work around the southeastern corner of the fire where the majority of recent growth <br />
has occurred. As the fire pushes up into the old Watson Fire burn area, fuels become less continuous and fire <br />
behavior is decreased. Crews are challenged by working around many snags in this area but are making good <br />
progress. Any fire that spots over or pushes the fire line has the potential for additional rapid growth. <br />
<br />
Firefighters continue to patrol the fireline along the southern to northwestern flanks of the fire. As crews patrol, <br />
they look for places to mitigate risks to the controlled line of the fire. Returning residents to these areas may see <br />
unburned fuels within the fire perimeter that will continue to burn and produce smoke for weeks.  <br />
<br />
The Oregon State Fire Marshal’s Office’s (OSFM) Green Team is demobilizing today after working at the fire for <br />
two weeks. Yesterday, they worked to support the transition of the incoming Red Team which will continue the <br />
OSFM’s mission of protecting lives and homes. The OSFM’s team is working in Unified Command with the two <br />
other incident management teams on the Bootleg Fire. <br />
<br />
“While our Incident Management Team may be transitioning, our dedication to protecting the community remains. <br />
Our firefighters are up to the task, their work the last two weeks has undoubtedly protected hundreds of homes <br />
and we remain vigilant to the task at hand.” Ian Yocum, Oregon State Fire Marshal’s Red Team Incident <br />
Commander.<br />
<br />
Community Meeting – Members of the team will meet with the community tonight, July 21, 2021, at 7:00 p.m. at <br />
the Alger Community Theatre (24 South F Street, Lakeview, OR 97630).</span>

Work on the Bruler Fire continued yesterday to keep the fire perimeter as small as possible. Firefighters <br />
continued to use hose and sprinklers to increase containment on the fire. The increase in acreage is due to <br />
continued backing of the fire on the west flank towards indirect line and more accurate mapping from an IR flight <br />
last night. The fire remains within the previously established direct and indirect lines. Containment is listed at <br />
12%.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Confidence builds daily as we continue to get tighter control lines and begin to mop up in high complexity <br />
topography and old growth trees. Dedicated mop up and continued tightening of line while establishing key <br />
alternate lines for the foreseeable future is critical. Due to the rugged terrain, deep duff layer and large old trees, <br />
this fire will be on the landscape until we receive significant rain. Taking the energy out of the fire area is critical <br />
to our success and remains our highest priority.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Firefighters use one of two main strategies to attack ground fires – indirect and direct. Indirect line is created at a <br />
safe distance away from the advancing fire. Firefighters on the Bruler Fire initially used the indirect line strategy <br />
to engage the fire. Direct line is created at the edge of the advancing fire. Today, firefighters are moving to use <br />
the direct line strategy around the perimeter of the fire as hazards are mitigated. Direct line increases the <br />
probability of keeping the Bruler Fire within its current footprint.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
“We are taking advantage of the moderated weather conditions to get as close to direct on the fire line as <br />
possible,” said Incident Commander Brian Gales.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
A large closure area is necessary to ensure that firefighters can focus on managing the fire and not needing to <br />
evacuate visitors should conditions on the fire change rapidly. We appreciate the support of the public in allowing <br />
us to stay focused on firefighting and we will reduce the closure area as soon as possible. Safety issues on the <br />
fire include large rocks and trees falling onto roadways without warning due to the fire.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
WEATHER AND FIRE BEHAVIOR: Today, the weather similar is to the weather yesterday, with high <br />
temperatures in the low to upper 70s and relative humidities in the 30% range. West winds are forecast, with <br />
gusts to 10 to 15 mph. Weather is forecast to get warmer and drier over the weekend, but the winds are forecast <br />
to stay light.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
SMOKE: Air quality in and around the communities of Detroit and Sweet Home continues to be listed as “good.” <br />
Light winds from the southwest are keeping smoke from the Bruler Fire and surrounding larger fires to the east.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
CLOSURES: A large closure area has been established to maintain firefighter and public safety. This closure <br />
encompasses large portions of Forest Service lands south of Detroit Lake, west of Highway 22 and north of <br />
Highway 20. The closure also includes the Middle Santiam Wilderness, Daly Lake, Tule Lake and the trail <br />
network known as the Old Cascade Crest trail system. The closure is posted to the Willamette National Forest <br />
webpage. A Bureau of Land Management (BLM) closure area is also in place for lands along the Quartzville <br />
Scenic Byway/Quartzville road including Yellowbottom Campground, Old Miner’s Meadow Group Site, and <br />
nearby dispersed camping areas. Visit InciWeb for more information about closures in the area.</span>

PUBLIC MEETING TONIGHT: Wednesday, July 21, starting at 6 p.m. The meeting will take place at the Mack <br />
Lloyd Park on the west side of Winthrop. Please bring your own chair and provide for physical distancing.<br />
<br />
Winthrop, WA — Cedar Creek and Delancy Fires are burning on the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest in <br />
very steep and rocky terrain in heavy down fuels.<br />
<br />
The fire has reached Lucky Jim Bluff and continues to move to the southeast along ridgelines. <br />
The fire burned actively in the Silver Star, Huckleberry, and Cedar Creek drainages. Firefighters will continue <br />
preparations on dozer line along the base of the foothills to the west of State Route 20 working south towards <br />
Twisp River drainage. The active fire behavior has prompted the Okanogan County Emergency Management <br />
Office (OECM) to declare several evacuation level increases. Three strike teams of engines (15 engines) arrived <br />
yesterday to assist with structure protection along State Route 20.<br />
<br />
In the northeast corner, crews conducted a small burnout operation and tied handline into Highway 20 to secure <br />
this portion of the line.  The northern and western flanks are expected to show minimal growth.<br />
<br />
The strategy of containment is to use indirect tactics and construct containment lines in areas with a high <br />
probability of success. The objective is to keep the fire in the higher elevations above the valley and away from <br />
values at risk of private property. The Cedar Creek fire is estimated at 14,857 acres with 11% containment.<br />
<br />
Closures:<br />
<br />
For the safety of the firefighters and aircraft fighting these fires, a temporary flight restriction (TFR) has been <br />
placed over the area. Please consult the “Notice to Airmen” (NOTAM) for specifics. Wildfires are a “No Drone <br />
Zone” and any drones sighting in a TFR will immediately ground aerial firefighting resources and delay <br />
suppression actions.<br />
<br />
State Route 20 (North Cascades Highway) remains closed at milepost 185 (7 miles west of Winthrop) to milepost <br />
165 to all traffic due to fire activity.<br />
<br />
The Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest has implemented a Fire Emergency Area Closure as of July 15, <br />
2021. The Closure includes facilities, roads, and trails. The Closure may be viewed in its entirety at the “Cedar <br />
Creek and Delancy Fires 2021” Facebook page.<br />
<br />
The Forest Service Fire Emergency Area Closure is separate from the Washington State Department of <br />
Transportation’s (WSDOT) closure of portions of State Route 20 and may change or be lifted at different times <br />
depending on operational needs. WSDOT is working closely with the Forest Service and Okanogan County to <br />
identify where fire activity and firefighting operations warrant closure.<br />
<br />
Evacuation Information: The Okanogan County Emergency Management (OCEM) continues to reevaluate <br />
evacuation levels. For the most up to date evacuation levels see the OCEM’s website above.  Residents entering <br />
Evacuation Level 3 areas need to slow down and watch for firefighters and equipment in roadways.<br />
<br />
Weather: A Red Flag Warning has been issued for the Methow Valley in the fire areas for gusty winds and low <br />
relative humidity. <br />
<br />
Air Quality: The west wind component overnight resulted in clearer skies this morning. However, Mazama, <br />
Winthrop and Twisp is likely to experience periods of unhealthy and hazardous smoke conditions today. As the <br />
transport winds shift to the NW overnight, expect degraded air quality in the Okanogan Valley including Tonasket, <br />
Conconully, Omak and Okanogan. When smoke is present, motorists should reduce speed and turn on <br />
headlights. <br />
<br />
Fire Restrictions: Campfire restrictions are in effect. Campfires are prohibited throughout the Okanogan-<br />
Wenatchee National Forest, including developed campgrounds and congressionally designated Wilderness — <br />
call local ranger district offices for more information. https://tinyurl.com/yby4oysq</span>

Operations Today: <br />
 <br />
Gusty winds throughout the day yesterday contributed to some fire growth on the northeast corner of the <br />
Chuweah Creek Fire. Crews worked to establish containment lines and caught several small spot fires just <br />
outside the fire perimeter caused by wind. <br />
 <br />
A Red Flag Warning is in effect for the fire area through the day today, as low relative humidity persists and wind <br />
gusts up to 30 MPH are expected. Line construction along the east edge of the fire on Keller Butte Ridge <br />
remains the priority as crews work to connect established containment lines. Engines will continue to patrol the <br />
south, west and north flanks of the fire. <br />
 <br />
NW Team 12 continues to coordinate and share resources with California Team 10 on the Summit Trail Fire, <br />
which is located northeast of the Chuweah Creek Fire. For information about the Summit Trail Fire, call <br />
385.999.1380.<br />
 <br />
Evacuations and Road Closures: <br />
 • Level 1 evacuation notifications are in place for residents of the town of Nespelem as well as the town of Keller, <br />
Buffalo Lake and McGinnis Lake communities and the San Poil Valley/Highway 21 corridor from South Nanamkin <br />
to the Keller Ferry.• Evacuation Levels have been reduced from Level 2 to Level 1 for residences at Owhi Flats <br />
and east of Owhi Lake, as well as residences along Cache Creek Rd. Road closures include: • Cache Creek <br />

Winthrop, WA — Cub Creek 2 – The fire is estimated at 35,134 acres with 5% containment. The fire is burning <br />
northward with lateral growth upslope to the west and east with low intensity backing downslope towards the <br />
Chewuch River.  Fire growth has been consistent for several operational periods.  Firefighting efforts have <br />
benefited in areas where the fire has merged into past burned areas and areas that have received previous fuel <br />
treatments.<br />
<br />
The fire remains split into east and west arms extending outward from approximately the confluence of Boulder <br />
Creek and the Chewuch River.  Overnight the fire burned actively and was not significantly different from daytime <br />
fire behavior as a result of poor relative humidity recovery and low fuel moisture.  Spotting up to one quarter mile <br />
is possible.   <br />
<br />
Fire line at the heel of the fire along the southern perimeter is holding and hand crews are using cold trailing <br />
techniques to prevent flare ups and reduce hot spots.  The area southwest and west of the fire is a priority to <br />
manage fire movement in Sherwood Creek and Deer Creek.  Aircraft will be used if available to deliver water to <br />
support the work of firefighters in those areas.  The 52 Road is being prepared to use as a containment line if <br />
necessary. Dozer line is in place southeast of the fire but the terrain past that line and west of Ramsey Peak is <br />
not favorable to heavy equipment and plans including the use of Pebble Creek as well as other routes are being <br />
considered for containment lines.  <br />
<br />
Firefighting efforts are focused on using existing features and reinforcing containment lines.<br />
<br />
Structure protection measures are in place.  <br />
<br />
Resource advisors with local expertise are providing input to firefighters to protect natural, cultural, and historic <br />
resources during firefighting operations. <br />
<br />
Please only call 911 if flare-ups occur near structures.<br />
<br />
Evacuation Information: The Okanogan County Emergency Management (OCEM) evacuations for the Chewuch <br />
River drainage have been reevaluated and remain in effect.  Please consult OCEM information resources for <br />
current evacuations.  Residents leaving Evacuation Level 3 areas should be extremely cautious, drive slowly, <br />
and watch for firefighters and firefighting equipment on the roadway. <br />
<br />
Closures:<br />
<br />
A new emergency Forest Closure Order has been issued by the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest which <br />
closes the fire area and multiple roads, campgrounds, and trails.  Please see the incident’s Inciweb and <br />
Facebook pages for the document in its entirety.  Please do not enter the closure area which is dangerous and <br />
will disrupt firefighting efforts. <br />
<br />
A Temporary Flight Restriction is in place over the fire area.  Please consult the “Notice to Airmen” (NOTAM) for <br />
specifics. Wildfires are a “No Drone Zone” and any drones sighting in a TFR will immediately ground aerial <br />
firefighting resources and delay suppression actions.<br />
<br />
Weather:  A Red Flag Warning has been issued for the Methow Valley. Smoke haze is expected early but <br />
clearing.  Winds will be from the west at 8-12 mph and gusting up to 25 mph.  Relative humidity will be 18-23%.<br />
<br />
Air Quality:  Air quality is expected to improve today.  Please monitor the air quality on the incident FB page <br />
above and the WA Smoke Blog and take appropriate actions. All vehicle traffic is advised to travel with lights on <br />
for safety.<br />
<br />
Fire Restrictions: Campfire restrictions are in effect. Campfires are prohibited throughout the Okanogan-<br />
Wenatchee National Forest, including developed campgrounds and congressionally designated Wilderness — <br />
call local ranger district offices for more information. https://tinyurl.com/yby4oysq<br />

Lloyd Park on the west side of Winthrop. Please bring your own chair and provide for physical distancing.<br />
<br />
Winthrop, WA — Cedar Creek and Delancy Fires are burning on the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest in <br />
very steep and rocky terrain in heavy down fuels.<br />
<br />
Delancy Fire The fire has moved over Delancy Ridge and is expected to continue to creep and smolder in steep, <br />
rocky, sparsely vegetated terrain and remains unstaffed due to the rugged terrain and scarce resource <br />
availability. Fire managers are evaluating values and risks. Containment opportunities are being actively scouted <br />
on the east side up Lost Creek Road. The fire is being monitored by aircraft. The estimated size of this fire is <br />
approximately 219 acres.<br />
<br />
Closures:<br />
<br />
For the safety of the firefighters and aircraft fighting these fires, a temporary flight restriction (TFR) has been <br />
placed over the area. Please consult the “Notice to Airmen” (NOTAM) for specifics. Wildfires are a “No Drone <br />
Zone” and any drones sighting in a TFR will immediately ground aerial firefighting resources and delay <br />
suppression actions.<br />
<br />
State Route 20 (North Cascades Highway) remains closed at milepost 185 (7 miles west of Winthrop) to milepost <br />
165 to all traffic due to fire activity.<br />
<br />
The Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest has implemented a Fire Emergency Area Closure as of July 15, <br />
2021. The Closure includes facilities, roads, and trails. The Closure may be viewed in its entirety at the “Cedar <br />
Creek and Delancy Fires 2021” Facebook page.<br />
<br />
The Forest Service Fire Emergency Area Closure is separate from the Washington State Department of <br />
Transportation’s (WSDOT) closure of portions of State Route 20 and may change or be lifted at different times <br />
depending on operational needs. WSDOT is working closely with the Forest Service and Okanogan County to <br />
identify where fire activity and firefighting operations warrant closure.<br />
<br />
Evacuation Information: The Okanogan County Emergency Management (OCEM) continues to reevaluate <br />
evacuation levels. For the most up to date evacuation levels see the OCEM’s website above.  Residents entering <br />
Evacuation Level 3 areas need to slow down and watch for firefighters and equipment in roadways.<br />
<br />
Weather: A Red Flag Warning has been issued for the Methow Valley in the fire areas for gusty winds and low <br />
relative humidity.<br />
<br />
Air Quality: The west wind component overnight resulted in clearer skies this morning. However, Mazama, <br />
Winthrop and Twisp is likely to experience periods of unhealthy and hazardous smoke conditions today. As the <br />
transport winds shift to the NW overnight, expect degraded air quality in the Okanogan Valley including Tonasket, <br />
Conconully, Omak and Okanogan. When smoke is present, motorists should reduce speed and turn on <br />
headlights. <br />
<br />
Fire Restrictions: Campfire restrictions are in effect. Campfires are prohibited throughout the Okanogan-<br />
Wenatchee National Forest, including developed campgrounds and congressionally designated Wilderness — <br />
call local ranger district offices for more information. https://tinyurl.com/yby4oysq</span>

Wallowa, OR  –  The Elbow Creek Fire, 17 miles northwest of Wallowa, is estimated at 18,599 acres and is 20 <br />
percent contained. The fire’s increasing complexity and growth has moved it up on the priority scale with other <br />
fires in the region. The higher ranking should provide more opportunity to acquire additional resources within the <br />
next few days. Six additional crews arrived yesterday evening to support current suppression efforts. <br />
<br />
Tuesday’s cooler conditions, combined with overnight showers is seen as an opportunity to get ahead of fire <br />
activity. Of concern is the Elbow Creek drainage, where the fire spotted from the east side of Elbow Creek over <br />
to the west side yesterday afternoon. Firefighters are hoping to gain direct access to the fire’s edge under today’s <br />
milder conditions with additional helicopter support. Crews are also going direct where they can in the Sickfoot <br />
and Deep Creek drainages, while planning for burnout operations where direct fire line construction in steep <br />
canyons is not an option. The north and east sides of the fire have not moved within the past few days and <br />
firefighters continue to mop up and patrol the area.  <br />
<br />
Lightning was spotted near the southwest side of the fire last night and the area is being monitored for possible <br />
new fires.  <br />
<br />
Level 2 and 3 evacuation notifications by the Wallowa County Sheriff’s Office remain unchanged. Additional <br />
information regarding evacuations is available on the Wallowa County Sheriff’s Office Facebook page <br />
(www.facebook.com/Wallowa-County-Sheriffs-Office-147212815486187).  <br />
<br />
Several fires continue to burn throughout Oregon and fire danger remains extreme. Fire officials continue to ask <br />
the public for assistance in preventing human-caused fires by following all fire regulations and restrictions. Log <br />
on to oregon.gov/odf for up-to-date fire restrictions in your area.</span>

Yesterday, a portion of the fire escaped containment lines, expanding to the north towards Pleasant Valley Road, <br />
growing to 50-100 acres in size.  Aerial support (helicopters, fire bosses, and retardant drops) worked in tandem <br />
with dozers and ground crews to stop forward progression of the fire and to construct a fire line.  In areas where <br />
the lines were indirect, crews conducted burnout operations.  Crews will continue to strengthen the line on the <br />
escaped potion of the fire.  There is a potential for spot fires as crews continue containment and evacuation <br />
levels have been adjusted to expand level 3 and level 2 due to the increase in risk. <br />
<br />
Additionally, crews will continue to work on constructing hose lays and engage in reducing hot spots to 25-50 feet <br />
into the interior.  Crews will work for several days to ensure hot spots are out to 150 feet or where necessary to <br />
contain the fire line and 500 feet around structures. <br />
<br />
 A red flag warning is in effect until Wednesday.  Regionally, lightning storms are moving through the area and <br />
could potentially produce new starts.  Locally, periodic heavy winds are forecasted until Wednesday night. Crews <br />
will continue monitoring the fire for changing conditions, which could increase the risk of spot fires.  Crews will <br />
monitor the fire for changing conditions and changes in fire behavior.  Pre-identified crews will be available for <br />
initial attack if additional fire starts occur in the area.</span>

Sisters, OR – The Grandview fire remains at 6,032 acres. Containment on the fire is now 84%.<br />
<br />
ODF IMT2 plans to transfer command of the fire to a local Central Oregon Fire Management Service Type 4 <br />
team at 6:00am Thursday morning. This will be ODF IMT2’s last update.<br />
<br />
Crews today will finish removing equipment and supplies from the fire line and continue mop up by carrying out a <br />
final grid search to extinguish heat 300’ or less inside the fire line.<br />
<br />
A regional Burned Area Emergency Response Team (BAER) will work with the local Type 4 team to assess the <br />
areas affected and develop a plan for suppression repair on federal lands while ODF will do suppression repair <br />
on ODF protected lands.<br />
<br />
We would like to thank the community for remaining vigilant and for obeying forest closures and fire restrictions <br />
put into place on the Deschutes National Forest and the Ochoco National Forest, Crooked River National <br />

Green Ridge Fire Current Situation: The Green Ridge Fire made an eastward push late in the day on Tuesday, <br />
further into the Wenaha-Tucannon Wilderness. With limited resources, the priority is protecting structures and <br />
securing containment lines to the north, south, and west.  On the east side if the fire, in the Wilderness, <br />
firefighters are scouting for natural features and previously burned areas that can be effectively used as <br />
containment lines. <br />
<br />
To the south of the fire, structure protection measures are in place for recreational residences at Little Turkey Tail <br />
and the Godman Guard station. Contingency lines are being constructed south from that area. North from the <br />
Godman area along the 46 road, crews have established fireline to the Midway Campground. A hand line and <br />
hose lay has been put in from the Midway Campground area to Panjab and the Meadow Creek drainage. South <br />
from the Tucannon area along the 4713 road, line preparation is completed, and more contingency lines are <br />
being added in the Tucannon drainage to the north and northeast of the fire.  <br />
<br />
Today’s Activities for Green Ridge Fire: Firefighters will continue to fortify road systems and hand lines. <br />
Contingency lines are being constructed north and south of the fire. Air support will help to slow the progression <br />
of fire movement, provide reconnaissance and continue to support ground resources. <br />
<br />
Weather and Smoke Information: Temperatures will warm back into the 80s in the mountains and upper 90s for <br />
the lower valleys.  Dry conditions are expected to persist. Smoke Information is available on the Washington <br />
Smoke Blog at: https://wasmoke.blogspot.com/ <br />

						    <span class="textarea">7/20/2021 Update:<br />
Last night, the region continued to experience marginal humidity recoveries, with winds <br />
<br />
from the west to northwest at 20 – 30 MPH. A Red Flag Warning has been issued for <br />
<br />
today, beginning at noon thru tomorrow night. Temperatures will be in the 80’s, with <br />
<br />
winds increasing this afternoon out of the northwest, with gusts reaching 20 – 30 MPH <br />
<br />
this evening and lasting into the overnight hours. Today will be another dry and warm day, <br />
<br />
with relative humidity’s in the low 20%. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Current Situation:<br />
<br />
Firefighters continued to make good progress on the fire by mopping-up in the upper <br />
<br />
elevations to extinguish any hot spots. Today, crews will continue to mop-up in the <br />
<br />
drainages and lower elevations. The upper elevations continue to be the most active <br />
<br />
due to the smoldering of large diameter trees and litter cast. On the western perimeter <br />
<br />
of the fire, going out to Eagle Rock, crews will continue to mop-up and keep the fire <br />
<br />
within the existing containment lines. Suppression repair will continue today, and heavy <br />
<br />
mop up will be the primary focus for crews today, especially near the communication <br />
<br />
site on Burch Mountain.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
This evening at 1800 hours, California Interagency Incident Management Team 1 will <br />
<br />
transition management of the Red Apple Fire to the local agency. This will be the final <br />
<br />
written update.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
The Red Apple Fire started on Tuesday July 13 at 7pm. Crews from Chelan County, <br />
<br />
DNR and BLM engaged in initial attack using ground and air assets. The threats to <br />
<br />
Swakane and Warner Nahahum Canyons, as well as the radio infrastructure on <br />
<br />
Burch Mountain have significantly reduced, but with dry fuel and hot dry weather, <br />
<br />
hazardous conditions remain.<br />

INCHELIUM, WASHINGTON – <br />
<br />
The fire burned actively into the night. Crews on night shift monitored and patrolled to keep the fire inside existing <br />
control lines. As of 6 a.m. on July 21, the western edge of the fire has held well along Bridge Creek. The northern <br />
edge was active yesterday, and crews are working along the Lynx Creek road to stop the fire’s northern spread. <br />
On its eastern side, the fire continued to burn west of Beaver Dam Creek and has crossed the Oregon City Ridge <br />
Road. Crews will prioritize looking for and taking opportunities to stop that spread toward the community of Twin <br />
Lakes today. The southern edge of the fire was very active yesterday, with fire establishing deep in the Bridge <br />
Creek drainage east of Upper Bridge Creek Road and then burning northeast into wind-aligned drainages along <br />
the southern edge of the fire. Crews will continue to try to hold that fire spread to the south while scouting <br />
opportunities for suppression today.  <br />
<br />
Aircraft was heavily used on the Summit Trail fire yesterday, including two “Fire Bosses,” which were (and will <br />
continued) to dip out of Twin Lakes. Boaters do not have to exit the lake when this aircraft is present, but are <br />
asked to move out of the way to give these vital firefighting resources space to safely work.  <br />
<br />
The community of Twin Lakes is currently under a Level 1 Evacuation. A Level 1 Evacuation advises residents <br />
that danger exists in their area. You should monitor local media outlets for information. Assemble emergency <br />
supplies and belongings in a safe place. Plan escape routes and make sure all those residing within the home <br />
know the plan of action. For more information, visit https://wasmoke.blogspot.com/p/national-interagency-fire-<br />
information.html.  <br />
<br />
The Reservation is currently shut down to industrial activities and the general public. The Tribes have imposed <br />
an Industrial Fire Precaution Level IV general shutdown, which closes all forest roads to the public. State and <br />
county improved roads (with a paved or gravel surface) remain open. The Summit Trail fire is burning on the <br />
Coville Indian Reservation. For more information about the Coville Indian Tribes, visit <br />
