<br />
Road Closures: State Highway 2 remains closed east of the junction of Index-Galena Road to the junction of 5th St N. into the town of <br />
Skykomish. The fire has destabilized the steep terrain above the highway resulting in rock falls, rolling debris and falling trees. Firefighters are <br />
working along the highway to identify fire weakened trees to increase public safety.  Hazards continue to make the Highway 2 corridor unsafe <br />
for public use. The Washington State Department of Transportation is working to clear trees and debris to maintain access for fire operations.   <br />
<br />
Update: Fire behavior is anticipated to be light.  The rains passing through the area have had little effect on the fire. Crews are extinguishing <br />
hot spots as the fire nears the highway and continue to prevent the fire from crossing Highway 2.  Crews are assessing areas of the fire above <br />
the road to determine what is needed to make the highway safe for public use.   <br />
<br />
On the east and west sides of the fire, additional crews and heavy equipment are establishing containment lines along forest roads. On the  <br />
west side along Forest Service Road 6022, between Highway 2 and the Index-Galena Road work is nearly completed.  On the east side, <br />
preparations along the 510 and 110 spur roads off the Forest Service 65/Beckler River Road are nearly completed.    <br />
<br />
Bolt Creek fire strategic objectives are to focus efforts to protect values at risk along Highway 2 corridor and prevent future spread to the west <br />
and east. As of now, 62% of that work has been completed. The north side of the fire is located in the Wild Sky Wilderness. Efforts in the <br />
wilderness are to maintain fire spread in that direction over time. Growth is expected to be minimal because of rock outcrops and other <br />
holding features which limit fire spread.  <br />
<br />
Washington State Mobilized Resources are still present and working diligently to protect homes and structures from the fire.  <br />
<br />
Weather and Fire Behavior: Onshore flow will continue today as a large disturbance moves south along the west coast. This will keep <br />
temperatures low and relative humidity elevated under mostly cloudy conditions. A slow warming and drying trend will begin on Sunday with <br />
almost no chance of precipitation. 67°F on the upper ridges and 51°F in the valleys, with minimum relative humidity near 57%. Winds will be <br />
light, coming out of the west-northwest at 5-8 mph. <br />
<br />
Fuels have been dry and the fire will move primarily with wind and slopes in steep terrain. The fire is still capable of large runs if winds <br />
increase above 25 mph. However, high winds are not currently predicted, and fine fuel moistures continue to increase with the rise in relative <br />
humidity resulting in reduced fire activity. <br />
<br />
Evacuation Levels: The need for evacuation level changes and road closures are evaluated daily.  At this time, evacuation remain the same:  <br />
- Level 1 (Ready): Index area; Skykomish area  <br />
- Level 3 (Go): Baring and Grotto and area along Highway 2 after milepost 48 (east of Money Creek tunnel) will remain at Level 3. Additionally, <br />
Forest Service Road 65 (Beckler River Road) is at Level 3.  <br />
? <br />
Current Evacuation and road closures can be found at: https://snohomish-county-public-safety-hub-snoco-gis.hub.arcgis.com/pages/wildfire  <br />
<br />
Forest Closure: The Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest has implemented an Emergency Closure on National Forest System lands.  <br />
Roads, trails, and campgrounds are closed. To read the closure in its entirety, please see:  MBSNF Bolt Creek Fire Closure  <br />
<br />
Smoke: Updated information on air quality may be found at Washington Smoke Blog at https://wasmoke.blogspot.com/ <br />
<br />
Sheltering: The Event Center in Startup is closed and no longer providing indoor shelter.  The Red Cross Shelter at the Evergreen State <br />
Fairgrounds is closed.  For Red Cross assistance, please call 1-800-RedCross.</span>

Summary: The Boulder Mountain Fire was detected on Wednesday August 31st, 2022, at approximately 6:00 pm. The fire is located in<br />
the Tacoma Creek and Boulder Mountain area, 9 miles Northwest of Cusick, Washington. A mix of State, Federal and Private land is<br />
impacted. The terrain is difficult, and the fire is burning in heavy timber, slash, and beetle infested trees. Cause of the fire remains<br />
under investigation.<br />
<br />
Weather|Anticipated Fire Behavior: Higher humidity levels and low cloud cover helped reduce fire activity yesterday. The sun did<br />
come out and begin the drying process later in the day but overnight temps and rising humidity took the edge off any gains.<br />
Today, expect windy conditions as a cold front approaches this evening. Winds will be out of the southwest again which will<br />
continue to push areas of heat further into the fire’s interior.<br />
<br />
Firefighters were able to employ infrared equipment to pinpoint and target hot spots, thus allowing for more direct firefighting efforts. Steady <br />
gains are being made daily as containment grew to 59%.<br />
<br />
Actions: Extensive mop up of the fire’s edge, coupled with patrolling will continue to take place over the next several days. The interior of the <br />
fire still has several areas of heat as large fuels continue to burn. Fallers are working to remove hazards trees allowing hand crews to move <br />
closer to the hot edge and continue suppression efforts. Additional resources are beginning to implement suppression repair in areas where <br />
the fire is contained.<br />
<br />
Important Information: Even with no, or limited smoke the Boulder Moutain Fire is far from ”out.” There are approximately 500 personnel still <br />
working on the fire and in the surrounding area, continuing to mop up the hot edges, cut hazard trees, and securing control lines. Not to <br />
mention all the heavy equipment repairing suppression dozer lines and roads used daily for various fire apparatus. The Colville National <br />
Forest still has a road and area closure in place to protect those responders still responding to this incident. Thank you to the public for <br />
adhering to this closure and their continued support of all the boots on the ground!</span>

Current Situation: The increased acreage is due to firing operations that have been implemented along the primary containment line on the <br />
west side of the fire over the past few days. As fuel moisture and weather permit, more aerial ignition will occur to slowly bring the main fire <br />
toward the completed burnout. In the East Zone, light westerly winds will influence fire spread to the east and potentially consume unburned <br />
fuels.<br />
<br />
Areas east and southeast of the Cedar Creek Fire will have the greatest smoke impacts, including: La Pine, Crescent Lake, and Silver Lake. <br />
Oakridge should have moderate to good air quality through the day, as will other areas to the west and southwest. The weather pattern <br />
moving in over the weekend should dampen smoke impacts.<br />
<br />
Oakridge Community Meeting: A community meeting is scheduled for 11 am Saturday, September 17 at the Oakridge High School Auditorium. <br />
The intent is to also stream the meeting on Facebook Live for those who cannot attend in-person <br />
(www.facebook.com/events/462741735787657 ).<br />
<br />
West Zone Update: On the west zone, the fire has been backing downhill and torching where there are accumulations of dead and down <br />
trees. On the north side of the fire, crews and equipment continue preparing the 19 road for firing operations to keep the fire south of that <br />
road. To the west, firefighters took advantage of favorable conditions to continue with aerial ignition, working the fire toward the primary <br />
containment line. This was a coordinated effort as firefighting resources, including hand crews, water tenders, skidders, engines, and air <br />
resources were all actively engaged in accomplishing the mission. Firefighters will mop-up and patrol along the completed burnout. To the <br />
south, the fire is backing from Bunchgrass Ridge toward containment lines. The night shift patrolled primary containment lines and mopped up <br />
where needed to keep the fireline secure.<br />
<br />
Given the steep terrain, heavy component of dead and down vegetation, and continuous tree canopy, this strategy has the highest probability <br />
of success for meeting the primary objectives of protecting the communities of Oakridge, Westfir and High Prairie as well as Highway 58 and <br />
Union Pacific Railway while limiting firefighter exposure to risks like tree strikes. The strategy takes time to implement as windows of <br />
opportunity for achieving successful firing operations can be short.<br />
<br />
East Zone Operations: The Wolf Creek Hotshots and Mormon Lake Hotshots are going direct on the fireline east of Charlton Lake where the <br />
fire crossed FS 4290. They are strengthening the FS 4290 as a holding line to prevent future potential spread of the fire to the south. Another <br />
barrier is being created by tying FS 5897 to the FS 4290 road to the north and to the Fuji Mountain trail and State Route 58 to the south. <br />
Another fuel break between Odell Lake and Davis Lake is being strengthened on the west side of FS 4668 to meet 4660. Similarly, road work <br />
is continuing on FS 700 to connect with FS 4630 that will tie together Crane Prairie Reservoir and Little Cultus Lake. Chipping operations are <br />
underway along FS 640 between Little Cultus Lake and Deer Lake. Work continues along the west side of the Cascade Lakes Highway to <br />
create a shaded fuel break. Masticators are working along State Route 58 north of Odell Lake. Weather: The weekend will bring a low-<br />
pressure system dropping south along the coast with a chance of rain Saturday night and into Sunday. There are a variety of conditions over <br />
the fire area, due to cloud cover and aspect. Rain is predicted for Saturday, however projections vary as to the amount of rain in different <br />
areas of the fire. Some scattered thunderstorms may develop in the East Zone.</span>

Sedro Woolley, WA – Weather conditions along with dry fuels continue to increase fire activity on the lightning-caused Chilliwack <br />
Complex. Increased easterly winds, high temperatures, and low humidity throughout the area have prompted a Red Flag Warning from <br />
the National Weather Service through Sunday evening. On Friday, the Copper Lake and Copper Ridge fires merged, and the North <br />
Fork and Little Chill fires merged. The two fires are now known as Copper Lake and Little Chill fires, respectively. The Silesia Fire had <br />
significant growth and is approximately one mile from the forest boundary with the Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest. This fire <br />
activity has prompted the closure of the Silesia Creek Trail. The Chilliwack Complex is made up of several active fires (Little Chill, <br />
Copper Lake, Brush Creek, Silesia, and Little Beaver Creek).<br />
<br />
 Crews continue protection measures on a pack bridge and suspension bridge near the Brush Creek Fire and on the cable car <br />
potentially threatened by the Copper Lake Fire. Firefighters continue to utilize helicopter bucket work on the Little Beaver Creek Fire.<br />
<br />
<br />
The Washington Department of Ecology announced an Air Quality Alert due to current wildfire smoke from the fires in the North <br />
Cascades. North and northeasterly winds are moving into the area, pushing regional smoke impacts from fires into the greater <br />
Bellingham-Seattle metropolitan area. Increasing smoke impacts, reduced visibility and short periods of UNHEALTHY air quality are <br />
expected into Sunday. As southwest winds return late Sunday, smoke impacts will shift back into the Wenatchee, Chelan, and <br />
Okanogan valleys. Take precautions when recreating outdoors when heavy smoke is present. Learn more at Real-Time Air Quality Map <br />
| PurpleAir, airnow.gov or visit https://wasmoke.blogspot.com/.  <br />
  <br />
Trail and camp closures remain in effect due to fire activity. Closure information can be found at <br />
https://www.nps.gov/noca/planyourvisit/trail-conditions.htm  <br />

Due to decreased fire activity, this will be the last daily update. If conditions change, information will be shared via the Crockets Knob <br />
Fire’s Facebook and Inciweb.  <br />
<br />
 Weather: Today will be dry with light winds. Temperatures will be in the low-70s, and the minimal relative humidity will be near 25 <br />
percent. Widespread smoke haze will be visible throughout <br />
the area.  <br />
<br />
Operations: Yesterday two excavators began conducting suppression repairs on the fire. One excavator worked along FSR 4555 and <br />
the other along interior containment lines near Indian <br />
Rock Lookout. The excavators were scattering fuels and constructing water bars. Crews continued to patrol containment lines all <br />
around the fire looking for any remaining heat. For the <br />
foreseeable future, firefighters will continue focusing on suppression repairs, monitoring and patrol along containment lines.  <br />
<br />
Closures and Evacuations:  There are no county evacuation alerts, and County Road 20 (Middle Fork Road) is open to all motorists.  <br />
<br />
The Malheur and Umatilla National Forests’ fire area closure remains in effect for areas east of FSR 45. However, the Forests’ will likely <br />
reduce the closure area within the next day or two. To <br />
stay informed about closure information, please continue checking: https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/malheur/notices/?<br />
cid=STELPRD3845529   <br />
<br />
Smoke may be visible to nearby communities and Forest visitors. Smoke and air quality impacts within the state can be monitored by <br />
visiting: http://oregonsmoke.blogspot.com <br />
<br />
The Malheur National Forest’s Public Use Restriction is Phase C on the Blue Mountain and Prairie City Ranger Districts. No campfires <br />
or personal chainsaw use is allowed. The Umatilla <br />
National Forest remains in Phase B, which allows campfires only in designated campgrounds and recreation sites. For more <br />
information, please go to: <br />
https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/malheur/fire, and  <br />
<br />
https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/umatilla/alerts-notices. <br />
<br />
Fire Danger remains Extreme for the surrounding area. The public can help us by making good decisions when they recreate on public <br />
lands and by following local fire restrictions.</span>

Highlights: The Southern Area Blue Team assumed command of the Double Creek, Sturgill, Nebo, and Goat Mountain 2 Fires at 6:00 a.m. <br />
today. The team worked alongside the outgoing Pacific Northwest team yesterday to assess the current situation of the fires and gain <br />
knowledge of the area that will help develop their plan moving forward. The Southern Area Blue Team plans to use the favorable current <br />
weather to make operational decisions that will set firefighters and the community up well when the forecasted warmer and drier weather <br />
arrives. Suppression and protection strategies will continue to be used but the team will also look to establish suppression repair branches in <br />
the coming days.<br />
Double Creek Fire: 157,185 acres | 27% contained |720 personnel assigned<br />
The lightning caused Double Creek Fire is a full suppression fire, and the protection of lives and property remain the primary objectives of this <br />
incident. The control line on the north of the fire was completed to Dug Bar Road. Crews will continue improving the fireline and are working <br />
with local resource advisors to protect cultural sites to the north in anticipation of increased fire activity during a forecasted warming                          <br />
period. From Imnaha to the spot fire area west of the Imnaha Grange remains in patrol status. An east-west line was established on the <br />
southern end of the fire that crews will work to tie into the trail system that runs along the rim of Hells Canyon Recreation Area.<br />
Eagle Cap Wilderness Fires<br />
There are three lightning caused fires within the Eagle Cap Wilderness. The Nebo, Sturgill, and Goat Mountain 2 Fires are being managed to <br />
protect public and private infrastructure while playing a natural role within designated Wilderness.<br />
Nebo Fire: 12,588 acres | 92 personnel assigned<br />
Fire activity has been minimal. Crews were able to continue cleaning up the roadside fuels reduction  project that was done on 39 Road <br />
yesterday after operations were delayed by weather on Thursday. Crews will work on the 3925 road today, cleaning up the remaining trees <br />
and brush left over from prepping that road. The Southern Area Blue Team will continue to improve on a fuel break north of the fire.<br />
Sturgill Fire: 20,075 acres | 51 personnel assigned<br />
The north end of Sturgill Fire is showing heat and moderate fire behavior. The fire will continue to be monitored by air, and personnel remain <br />
at structure protection sites in the area. Work will continue on the shaded fuel break from Lostine to Bear Creek Road. The fuel break is <br />
approximately 50 percent completed with the remainder expected to be completed within a week.<br />
Goat Mountain 2 Fire: 536 acres | 0 personnel assigned<br />
Fire activity on the Goat Mountain 2 Fire is minimal. Firefighters will continue to monitor the fire by air as smoke and weather permit.<br />
Weather: This weekend will be cool and recent high humidity will remain. There are chances of rain this weekend, but the rain will not fall <br />
across a wide area. The system will likely come from the south and the Sturgill Fire currently has the best chance of receiving rain. The Nebo <br />
Fire and Double Creek Fire may receive little to no precipitation. This afternoon shows chances for thunderstorms that could last into the <br />
evening. One week remains in this period of cooler, wetter conditions before the area trends back to a warmer, drier period.</span>

<br />
Overview: The Goat Rocks Fire continues to burn 1.5 miles northeast of the town of Packwood, Washington in and around the Goat Rocks <br />
Wilderness area. The fire has been relatively quiet in movement and overall fire behavior. The cooler weather conditions are aiding fire crews <br />
with suppression efforts. Crews are taking advantage of this opportunity to strengthen contingency lines around the fire and enhance <br />
protection measures around structures. In the wilderness areas, Minimum Impact Suppression Tactics (MIST) are guiding the work that is <br />
ongoing there. MIST is focused on doing enough work to suppress the fire safely, while impacting the landscape as little as possible.<br />
Fire Activity: Fire crews yesterday were able to complete their work along Forest Roads 1266 and 041. Hand crews completed removing <br />
brush along the 46 Road where it was inaccessible to machinery, and equipment was brought in to begin chipping the removed material. <br />
Additionally, engines continued to patrol around the neighborhoods and improving their work where needed.<br />
<br />
Today, equipment will be used to continue with clearing along the 46 Road. Crews will begin clearing an alternate line to act as a contingency <br />
to the established break along the 041 Road. Another chipper has been ordered, and crews will begin chipping the material cut from around <br />
structures. The Wildland Fire Use Module will continue to scout and monitor the fire’s progression into the Goat Rocks Wilderness Area. <br />
Forest Closures: For a current map of all the roads and trails that are closed due to the Goat Rocks Fire, see this link <br />
https://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fseprd1060181.pdf<br />
<br />
Evacuations: All of Packwood and its surrounding communities except for Upper Timberline are at an Evacuation Level 1 (Be Ready). Upper <br />
Timberline is now at an Evacuation Level 2 (Be Set).<br />
<br />
Fire Restrictions: Campfire bans and other use restrictions are in place across the Gifford Pinchot National Forest and much of the region. <br />
Campfires are allowed within certain campgrounds on an approved list at: https://www.fs.usda.gov/alerts/giffordpinchot/alerts-notices<br />
Weather: We have been seeing an onshore flow, bringing in cool temperatures and more moisture. Starting today, we will be experiencing a <br />
switch to an offshore flow, with warm dry air blowing from east to west. This will bring some drier and warmer conditions along with the <br />
potential for more smoke, due to light winds out of the east. There is a chance of showers late tonight or early tomorrow morning.<br />
Public Safety: Increased traffic is expected with the ongoing weekend activities and fire personnel continuing to work in the area. Please use <br />
caution when traveling near the area and adhere to the posted speed limits.<br />
<br />
Donations: Northwest Incident Management Team 10 would like to extend to the community a heartfelt thank you for all your generous offers <br />
to provide donations to firefighters. Firefighters are well-provisioned, so we invite you to donate to your local Red Cross, Lewis County Fire <br />
District #10 (Packwood) and the Wildland Firefighter Foundation.<br />

Plain, WA – Lightning started the White River and Irving Peak Fires on August 11th. The Minnow Ridge Fire cause is undetermined. <br />
These fires are burning on the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest.<br />
<br />
Suppression Strategy – Due to rugged and steep terrain, fire managers continue to implement a long-term strategy to manage these <br />
fires, including the use of primary and contingency perimeter lines for containment. Tactics include completion and reinforcement of fire <br />
lines utilizing forest roads and constructed hand line.<br />
<br />
Current Situation – A local Type 3 Incident Management Team assumed command of the fires on September 7th and is currently <br />
managing the White River, Irving Peak, Meander, and now Minnow Ridge fires. The Meander Fire remains at 6 acres with very minimal <br />
fire activity. Smoke may be visible over the next several weeks as interior fuels continue to smolder and burn out, and multiple fires burn <br />
region-wide. Updates will be posted weekly unless significant new activity occurs.<br />
<br />
White River Fire – Acres: 3,184 (as of 9/13/2022); 5% contained; Location: Sears Creek area of the White River drainage, <br />
approximately 14 miles NW of Plain, WA.<br />
The fire area remains drier and more active along the southern edges. The fire footprint remains within the control lines, and geographic <br />
features being utilized as containment lines. Firefighters are working to establish an anchor point and maintain the structure protection <br />
along Sears Creek Road and Windmill Lane.<br />
<br />
Irving Peak Fire – Acres: 3,226 (as of 9/9/2022); 5% contained; Location: Approximately 16 miles NW of Plain, WA<br />
The Irving Peak Fire received some precipitation yesterday with minimal growth and fire activity. Firefighters continue to improve roads <br />
used as containment lines and monitor fire activity.<br />
<br />
Minnow Ridge Fire – Acres: 502 (as of 9/13/2022); 0% contained; Location: Chikamin Ridge, approximately 14 miles N of Plain, WA.<br />
Fire activity has been moderate and mainly consuming ground fuels. Firefighters continue scouting forest roads and fire lines previously <br />
utilized during past wildfire activity to determine if they may benefit the current fire suppression strategy.  <br />
<br />
Weather – A chance of showers exists over the fire area today, Wednesday, September 14th, with west winds around 6-8 mph. Cooler <br />
temperatures and higher relative humidity continue into later this week.<br />
<br />
Air Quality and Smoke – Current information about air quality and health recommendations during smoky conditions is available on the <br />
Washington Smoke Blog https://wasmoke.blogspot.com/<br />
<br />
Closures – An emergency closure issued by the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest remains in place and can be viewed here: <br />
www.fs.usda.gov/alerts/okawen/alerts-notices. The PCT remains open and is not directly impacted by these fires. Several trails in the <br />
Chikamin Ridge area are pending closure due to the Minnow Ridge Fire. Fire managers are asking people to please respect these <br />
closures while recreating in the area.<br />
<br />
Restrictions – Campfires are not allowed anywhere within the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest. Stage 2 Restrictions are now in <br />
effect for the entire forest, including campgrounds and wilderness areas: www.fs.usda.gov/detail/okawen/alerts-notices/?<br />
cid=fsbdev3_053600.<br />
<br />
Evacuations – Current Chelan County evacuation levels include a Level 2 evacuation (Be Prepared) for Sears Creek Road and Level 1 <br />
(Stay Alert) for White River Road and Little Wenatchee Road. www.co.chelan.wa.us/emergency-management/pages/active-<br />

						    <span class="textarea">Increased fire activity on some of the lightning caused fires, burning in the very remote, steep, and inaccessible terrain in the northwest <br />
corner of the Pasayten Wilderness Area, spurred trail and area closures over the holiday weekend. Hot, dry, and windy conditions are <br />
expected today as a trough moves into the area which is expected to create conditions for increased fire behavior. The Shull, The <br />
Parks, Kid, Three Fools, Skagit, and Elbow fires, located near the Canadian-U.S border, are expected to grow in acreage today.<br />
<br />
In a joint delegation with the National Park Service, a National Incident Management Organization Team, NIMO Team 2, assumed <br />
command yesterday over the six fires now being called the NW Pasayten Fires, located in the Pasayten Wilderness on the Methow <br />
Valley Ranger District of the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest, as well as the Chilliwack Complex Fires within the North Cascades <br />
National Park Service Complex.<br />
<br />
A number of closures are in effect including an area closure for the Freezeout Creek basin and a number of trails and portions of trails <br />
in the area. Portions of both the Pacific Crest Trail and Pacific Northwest Trail remain closed at this time.<br />
<br />
Smoke from these fires, and other fires burning in the region, may impact north central Washington communities over the next few <br />
days. Take precautions when recreating outdoors when heavy smoke is present. Learn more at Real-Time Air Quality Map | PurpleAir, <br />
airnow.gov or visit https://wasmoke.blogspot.com/.<br />
<br />
Update on individual NW Pasayten Fires:<br />
•     The Kid Fire, located on the ridge between Rock Creek and West Fork Pasayten, is approximately 8 miles south of the Canadian-<br />
U.S. border. The fire has been very active with spotting and torching of grouped trees. Yesterday, smokejumpers worked on protection <br />
of the historic airport cabin, situated about one quarter mile away from the Kid Fire, utilizing pumps and sprinklers. If conditions allow, <br />
smokejumpers will also be burning out unburned brush between the fire and the cabin.<br />
•     The Parks Fire is also very active. It crossed the border into Canada a couple of days ago. There is a Canadian Incident <br />
Management Team assigned to the Canadian portion (called the Heather Fire north of the border) of the Parks Fire. The fire is about <br />
one half mile from the Monument 83 Fire Lookout at the time of this release. Firefighters have prepared the lookout by wrapping the <br />
base with fire protective wrap.<br />
•    The Skagit Fire, located in Freezeout Creek 6 miles south of the border, spread northward and crossed over the top of the ridge and <br />
down the other side.<br />
•     Three Fools Fire, located 8 miles south of the border, is actively backing down the ridge and through an old burn scar, it has spotted <br />
north of the ridge. <br />
•     The Elbow Fire, located 6 miles south of the border, is actively backing down the slope near Skagit Peak.<br />
•     Tuesday, fire activity increased on the Shull Fire located 11 miles south of the border.</span>

						    <span class="textarea">September 14, 2022 - Final Update<br />
<br />
Klamath Falls, Ore. – Last night fire crews continued to use infrared cameras to identify areas of heat around the perimeter of the fire. <br />
They are mainly finding heat under juniper trees on the southern and western areas.<br />
<br />
Today is the last day the Oregon Department of Forestry’s Type 1 Incident Management Team will be in command of the fire. Transition <br />
to the local Type 4 team will happen tomorrow at noon. The objectives for the local team will remain the same. Multiple engines and <br />
crews will continue to mop up where it warrants.<br />
<br />
Weather today will be cooler and more humid. Gusty winds are expected in the late afternoon and early evening.<br />
<br />
Residential traffic is allowed in the fire area, but residents are encouraged to drive slowly and be aware of fire operation traffic as they <br />
travel through the fire. Bureau of Land Management lands in and around the fire area remain closed to the public.<br />
<br />
We would like to remind the public that Klamath and Lake counties are still in extreme fire danger. Human-cause fire stats are down this <br />
fire season, so please help your local resources by preventing anything that can spark a fire. Visit <br />
https://www.oregon.gov/odf/fire/pages/restrictions.aspx for fire restrictions in your area or areas you may be traveling to.  <br />
<br />
This will be the final fire update from the ODF IMT. The team would like to thank the cooperators and public for their support during the <br />
fire. Without local resources and support from the community our team would not have been as successful.</span>

						    <span class="textarea">White River and Irving Peak Fire Update<br />
September 14, 2022<br />
<br />
Plain, WA – Lightning started the White River and Irving Peak Fires on August 11th. The Minnow Ridge Fire cause is undetermined. <br />
These fires are burning on the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest.<br />
<br />
Suppression Strategy – Due to rugged and steep terrain, fire managers continue to implement a long-term strategy to manage these <br />
fires, including the use of primary and contingency perimeter lines for containment. Tactics include completion and reinforcement of fire <br />
lines utilizing forest roads and constructed hand line.<br />
<br />
Current Situation – A local Type 3 Incident Management Team assumed command of the fires on September 7th and is currently <br />
managing the White River, Irving Peak, Meander, and now Minnow Ridge fires. The Meander Fire remains at 6 acres with very minimal <br />
fire activity. Smoke may be visible over the next several weeks as interior fuels continue to smolder and burn out, and multiple fires burn <br />
region-wide. Updates will be posted weekly unless significant new activity occurs.<br />
<br />
White River Fire – Acres: 3,184 (as of 9/13/2022); 5% contained; Location: Sears Creek area of the White River drainage, <br />
approximately 14 miles NW of Plain, WA.<br />
The fire area remains drier and more active along the southern edges. The fire footprint remains within the control lines, and geographic <br />
features being utilized as containment lines. Firefighters are working to establish an anchor point and maintain the structure protection <br />
along Sears Creek Road and Windmill Lane.<br />
<br />
Irving Peak Fire – Acres: 3,226 (as of 9/9/2022); 5% contained; Location: Approximately 16 miles NW of Plain, WA<br />
The Irving Peak Fire received some precipitation yesterday with minimal growth and fire activity. Firefighters continue to improve roads <br />
used as containment lines and monitor fire activity.<br />
<br />
Minnow Ridge Fire – Acres: 502 (as of 9/13/2022); 0% contained; Location: Chikamin Ridge, approximately 14 miles N of Plain, WA.<br />
Fire activity has been moderate and mainly consuming ground fuels. Firefighters continue scouting forest roads and fire lines previously <br />
utilized during past wildfire activity to determine if they may benefit the current fire suppression strategy.  <br />
<br />
Weather – A chance of showers exists over the fire area today, Wednesday, September 14th, with west winds around 6-8 mph. Cooler <br />
temperatures and higher relative humidity continue into later this week.<br />
<br />
Air Quality and Smoke – Current information about air quality and health recommendations during smoky conditions is available on the <br />
Washington Smoke Blog https://wasmoke.blogspot.com/<br />
<br />
Closures – An emergency closure issued by the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest remains in place and can be viewed here: <br />
www.fs.usda.gov/alerts/okawen/alerts-notices. The PCT remains open and is not directly impacted by these fires. Several trails in the <br />
Chikamin Ridge area are pending closure due to the Minnow Ridge Fire. Fire managers are asking people to please respect these <br />
closures while recreating in the area.<br />
<br />
Restrictions – Campfires are not allowed anywhere within the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest. Stage 2 Restrictions are now in <br />
effect for the entire forest, including campgrounds and wilderness areas: www.fs.usda.gov/detail/okawen/alerts-notices/?<br />
cid=fsbdev3_053600.<br />
<br />
Evacuations – Current Chelan County evacuation levels include a Level 2 evacuation (Be Prepared) for Sears Creek Road and Level 1 <br />
(Stay Alert) for White River Road and Little Wenatchee Road. www.co.chelan.wa.us/emergency-management/pages/active-<br />
