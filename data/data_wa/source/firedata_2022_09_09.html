<br />
Summary: The Boulder Mountain Fire was detected on Wednesday August 31st, 2022, at approximately 8:30 pm. The fire is located in <br />
the Tacoma Creek and Boulder Mountain area, 9 miles Northwest of Cusick, Washington. A mix of State, Federal and Private land is <br />
impacted. The terrain is difficult, and the fire is burning in heavy timber, slash, and beetle infested trees. Cause of the fire remains under <br />
investigation.  <br />
<br />
Weather|Anticipated Fire Behavior: Shifting winds will continue through Today. Continued dry weather and higher than normal <br />
temperatures remain in the forecast.  Fire managers are paying close attention to the shifts in wind direction. If winds align with the <br />
terrain and unburned pockets of timber, there is a strong possibility of very active fire behavior with the potential for spot fires away from <br />
the main fire footprint. Smokey conditions in the area are likely. <br />
<br />
Actions: Yesterday, work continued establishing both hand and mechanical containment lines. Firefighters are making progress; the fire <br />
is now 6% contained. With additional crews in place, the plan is to continue securing the line by mopping up the edge and increasing <br />
the depth of “cold black.” This involves seeking out pockets of heat and putting them out, which will manifest in an increased <br />
containment percentage.  Air support was again instrumental in helping firefighters to quickly contain spot fires pushed by the wind.<br />
<br />
The plans today, are to continue the progress of the last few days. With hose lines being positioned where ground resources will be <br />
able to target creeping and smoldering activity around the edge. Wind conditions could potentially impact both the responder’s efforts <br />
and fire behavior. <br />
<br />
Important Information: The Colville National Forest, Boulder Mountain Fire Closure is now in effect. This closure is to protect the health <br />
and safety of the responders and public in and around the Boulder Mountain Fire area.</span>

NEW EVACUATION LEVELS: Yesterday, the Deschutes County Sheriff’s Office has increased their evacuation levels for Cultus Lake <br />
and Crane Prairie Reservoir. Visit Deschutes and Lane County websites for up-to-date information.  <br />
<br />
RED FLAG WARNING: A Red Flag Warning will be in effect starting at midnight, Friday morning, due to low humidities and strong east <br />
winds. Winds speeds are expected to be 15-25 mph with gusts of up to 35 mph—Friday morning and afternoon. Winds are expected to <br />
increase throughout Friday evening with speeds 15-25 mph and gust up to 50 mph. <br />
<br />
Virtual Community Meeting: Today Thursday, September 8th, 7:00PM, focused on Deschutes County and Central Oregon, virtually on <br />
the Cedar Creek Fire Facebook Page. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Current Situation: Yesterday, the fire continued to push northeast of Waldo Lake. It reached Lower Quinn Lake and Irish Lake in the <br />
north. In the east, it touched the base of Lemish Butte and crossed Charlton Butte. The fire is four miles from Crane Prairie Reservoir. <br />
Crews worked on point protection in the Cultus Lake Area securing aluminum structure wrap around the lodge and surrounding cabins, <br />
in addition to setting up sprinkler systems. Strategic burning operations were successfully completed on the northwestern edge of the <br />
fire along Forest Road (FR) 2417 and southwest edge along FR 2421 to secure lines at those points.  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Today’s Activities: Today, firefighters will establish an anchor point on the northeastern edge of Waldo Lake and work towards Little <br />
Cultus Lake as a primary line of defense. Crews will continue point protection in the Cultus Lake area. On the western portion of the fire <br />
area, holding and improving lines is the primary objective. In anticipation of the Red Flag Warning, firefighters will be strategically <br />
placed around the fire overnight. Crews and equipment are prepared for initial attack on any new starts or spot fires and will relay <br />
current conditions throughout the evening.  Alaska Team 1 that was prepositioned in Redmond, Oregon, is joining NW Team 6 to begin <br />
managing the eastern zone of the Cedar Creek Fire; effective tomorrow.  Multiple teams managing a large fire allows on-the-ground <br />
resources to be supported closer to their firefighting activities. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Weather: High temperatures are predicted to reach 85°F in lower elevations and 77°F in higher elevations. Winds from the NW will <br />
reach speeds of 6-8 mph with gusts of up to 15 mph. Poor humidity levels overnight will allow for an extended burn window. A RED <br />
FLAG WARNING will be in effect starting at midnight, Friday morning.  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Closures: The Deschutes National Forest and Willamette National Forest have implemented closures for the Cedar Creek Fire. Please <br />
visit Willamette National Forest and Deschutes National Forest for detailed closure orders and a joint map. A Temporary Flight <br />
Restriction (TFR) is in place. Pacific Crest Trail hikers should visit pcta.org for current information.</span>

						    <span class="textarea">Sedro Woolley, WA – There is increased fire activity on the Chilliwack Complex due to Wednesday’s weather event with increased <br />
winds and low humidity throughout the area. Two of the four lightning-caused fires (Copper Lake and Brush Creek Fire) experienced <br />
growth and will likely merge into one fire in the Copper Loop and Whatcom Pass areas of North Cascades National Park Service <br />
Complex. An additional fire, Little Beaver Creek Fire, was detected and is estimated at one quarter acre. The Chilliwack Complex is <br />
estimated 4,538 acres.  <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
A pack bridge and a suspension bridge that are both potentially threatened by the Brush Creek Fire have been plumbed with pumps, <br />
hose, and sprinklers. The fire was about a thousand feet away and backing towards the pack bridge Wednesday afternoon. The Copper <br />
Lake Fire is less than a half-mile from the cable car at the time of this release. Crews are poised and protection measures will be <br />
implemented on the pack bridge, suspension bridge, and cable car today. On Wednesday, firefighters utilized helicopter water buckets <br />
on the Little Beaver Creek Fire and will continue during Thursday’s operation.   <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
There are additional trail and camp closures due to fire activity. The full trail and camp closure for the Chilliwack Complex includes the <br />
entire Little Beaver Trail, Big Beaver Trail beyond Pumpkin Mountain and Big Beaver camps, Brush Creek, Chilliwack, and Copper Loop <br />
trails. Camp closures include all camps between Little Beaver and Boundary camps and all camps between 39 Mile and Beaver Pass <br />
camps. All cross-country zones access from closed trails is prohibited.  <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Today will be a transition day with high pressure moving over the complex. Warm, dry, and gusty conditions under northeast winds are <br />
predicted for Friday and Saturday. A Red Flag Warning has been issued for wind gusts to 30 mph and relative humidity as low as 20 <br />
percent. Critical fire weather conditions will continue into Sunday with dry and unstable conditions.  <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Smoke from the area fire will affect the Methow Valley. A haze over the general area is to be expected with active fires across the <br />
region. Take precautions when recreating outdoors when heavy smoke is present. Learn more at Real-Time Air Quality Map | PurpleAir, <br />
airnow.gov or visit https://wasmoke.blogspot.com/. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Visitors with backcountry reservations into the closure area should be aware that permits are cancelled on a rolling basis based on fire <br />
activity and conditions. Cancellation notifications and refunds are through the recreation.gov system.  <br />

Weather:  Temperatures are expected to be cooler today, and winds will be calmer. Temperatures will be in the low-80s this afternoon <br />
with wind gusts up to 20 mph. Conditions will still be dry with relative humidity in the teens.  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Operations: Yesterday the fire perimeter was tested by high winds, and firefighters kept the fire within established containment lines. <br />
The fire received some rainfall yesterday afternoon, which helped with mop up efforts. Spots west of the FSR 45 were completely <br />
mopped up and will continue to be monitored to ensure they remain secure. Mop up along the FSR 45 and FSR 537 continued, and <br />
improvements along the contingency line north of FSR 45 and FSR 537 were nearly completed. Today, heavy equipment should <br />
complete the contingency line up to the Sharp Ridge / Indian Rock Trailhead. On the northeastern and eastern flanks, containment lines <br />
are in place around the burned pockets of subalpine fir, and today crews will continue mopping up any remnant heat they find. <br />
Yesterday crews monitored and patrolled the southern edge of the fire, which will continue today. Crews will be removing excess hoses <br />
and equipment from secured containment lines on the western, southern and eastern edges of the fire. All containment lines will <br />
continue to be monitored and patrolled. Crews received minimal support from helicopters yesterday due to high winds and <br />
thunderstorms. With favorable weather, helicopters are expected to resume support of firefighting efforts along the northeastern flank.  <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Closures and Evacuations:  Grant County has issued a Level One evacuation advisory in the area of the fire. Level One means be <br />
ready and aware of fire conditions. You can view a map of the evacuation zone on the Grant County Emergency Management <br />
Facebook page. A closure is in effect on the Malheur and Umatilla National Forests today. For complete closure information, please go <br />

Community Meeting Tonight: There will be a community meeting to discuss the Double Creek, Sturgill, Nebo, and Goat Mountain 2 <br />
Fires tonight at 6 p.m. The meeting will be held at the Joseph Event Center (102 E First, Joseph, OR) and will also be streamed live on <br />
Facebook.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Highlights: The passage of a cold front over the fire area yesterday brought gusty erratic winds which produced rapid fire growth on the <br />
Double Creek Fire. Before the strongest winds arrived in the evening, firefighters were able to complete firing operations along the <br />
Lower Imnaha Road to protect the community of Imnaha. Tactical firing and structure protection operations also took place on the south <br />
side of the Double Creek Fire. There was little fire growth on the fires in the Eagle Cap Wilderness. <br />
<br />
<br />
Double Creek Fire: 100,977 acres | 0% contained | 553 personnel assigned<br />
<br />
The lightning caused Double Creek Fire is a full suppression fire, and the protection of lives and property remain the primary objectives <br />
of this incident. As the cold front approached throughout the day, winds were gusty and erratic. As the front passed in the late afternoon <br />
high winds with gusts reported to 50 mph led to extreme fire behavior as the fire spread on Grizzly, Haas, Sleepy and Windy Ridges <br />
gaining over 30,000 acres. Firefighters conducted tactical firing operations from Imnaha north along the river corridor. Structure defense <br />
preparations took place for values in the Lightning and Horse Creek drainages and other structures north of the fire. Firefighters <br />
conducted firing operations and protected structures from Freezeout Road south to Balter Creek on the south side of the fire. Today <br />
firefighters, including Oregon State Fire Marshal (OSFM) task forces, will continue to secure the community of Imnaha and values north <br />
of the fire, keep the fire east of the Imnaha River and secure structures south of the fire, and assess structures along the Snake River. <br />
<br />
<br />
Eagle Cap Wilderness Fires  <br />
<br />
There are three lightning caused fires within the Eagle Cap Wilderness. The Nebo, Sturgill, and Goat Mountain 2 Fires are active and <br />
being managed to protect public and private infrastructure, while playing a natural role within designated Wilderness.  <br />
<br />
Weather: With the passage of the cold front yesterday, slightly lower temperatures and lighter winds are expected today though it <br />
remains extremely dry. It will still be a day of elevated fire weather, but not the critical fire weather from the previous two days. Wind will <br />
be out of the northwest. In areas where the wind aligns with a northwest facing slope expect higher winds with gusts of 15-25 mph. <br />
<br />
<br />
Smoke: Current air quality information for the local area is available on the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality – Air Quality <br />
Monitoring website and PurpleAir website.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Evacuations: A Level 3 “Go Now” is in effect for the Town of Imnaha north to Fence Creek (including lands east to Lightning Creek) and <br />
south to Grouse Creek. A Level 2 “Get Set” is in effect for Lostine River Road from Fir Road to Two Pan (including all campgrounds and <br />
trailheads), Upper Imnaha from Grouse Creek to Pallette Ranch, and areas around Dug Bar Road north of Fence Creek. A Level 1 “Be <br />
Ready” is in effect for Lostine River Road from Highway 82 to Fir Road and for Upper Imnaha Road from Pallette Ranch to Wallowa <br />
Mountain Road (FSR 39).</span>

<br />
September 8, 2022 - 9:00 AM<br />
<br />
Plain, WA – Lightning started the White River and Irving Peak Fires on August 11. The fires are burning on the Okanogan-Wenatchee <br />
National Forest, northwest of Plain, WA.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Suppression Strategy – Fire managers continue to implement a long-term strategy to manage these fires, including the use of primary <br />
and contingency perimeter lines for containment. Tactics include completion and reinforcement of fire lines using roads and constructed <br />
hand line.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Current Situation – A local Type 3 Incident Management Team assumed command of the fires on September 7th at 7:00 am. Smoke <br />
may be visible over the next several weeks as interior fuels continue to smolder and burn out. Fire updates will continue every other <br />
day; if a change in fire activity occurs, the frequency may change.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Last night’s overnight infrared flight could not fly; acreage does not reflect yesterday’s growth.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
White River Fire – Acres: 1,576 (from 9/7/2022); 1% contained; Location: Sears Creek area of the White River drainage, approximately <br />
14 miles NW of Plain, WA.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Yesterday, with Red Flag conditions and gusty winds, fire activity increased. Fire growth occurred on the southwest and southeast <br />
flanks. Two engines staffed a night shift last night to patrol and monitor activity. The fire footprint remains within the control lines and <br />
geographic features being utilized as containment lines. Firefighters continue to establish an anchor point, monitor activity, and maintain <br />
structure protection along Sears Creek Road and Windmill Lane.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Irving Peak Fire – Acres: 3,062 (from 9/7/2022); 7% contained; Location: Approximately 16 miles NW of Plain, WA<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The Irving Peak Fire saw little growth over the last two days. Firefighters continue work along roads and containment lines and monitor <br />
fire behavior and spread utilizing ground and aerial resources.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Weather – A Fire Weather Watch is possible tomorrow, Friday, September 9th, due to a wind shift bringing easterly winds and gusts up <br />
to 25mph. Over the next few days, temperatures will remain in the 70s and low 80s.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Air Quality and Smoke – Current information about air quality and health recommendations during smoky conditions is available on the <br />
Washington Smoke Blog https://wasmoke.blogspot.com/<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Closures – An emergency closure issued by the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest remains in place and can be viewed here: <br />
www.fs.usda.gov/alerts/okawen/alerts-notices. Fire managers are asking people to please respect these closures while recreating in the <br />
area. The PCT remains open and not directly impacted by the fires, but the Little Wenatchee Ford and White River Trailheads cannot <br />
be used to access the PCT.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Restrictions – Campfires are not allowed anywhere within the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest. Stage 2 Restrictions are now in <br />
effect for the entire forest, including campgrounds and wilderness areas: www.fs.usda.gov/detail/okawen/alerts-notices/?<br />
cid=fsbdev3_053600.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Evacuations – Current Chelan County evacuation levels include a Level 2 evacuation (Be Prepared) for Sears Creek Road and Level 1 <br />
(Stay Alert) for White River Road and Little Wenatchee Road. www.co.chelan.wa.us/emergency-management/pages/active-<br />
emergencies<br />

						    <span class="textarea">The Jones Creek Fire began on 9/4/22. The cause is under investigation. It began on the Idaho side of the Wallowa-Whitman National <br />
Forest, 7 miles north of Pittsburg Landing on the Snake River. Fire behavior is moderate, smoldering and creeping. It is burning primarily in <br />
short grass, with timber stringers and some brush. A wet summer early in the season resulted in an abundance of grass, and recent hot, <br />
dry unstable conditions lead to rapid rates of spread during initial attack. Successful suppression actions by aerial resources and ground <br />
crews have slowed the fires' progression and limited impacts.</span>

						    <span class="textarea">Increased fire activity on some of the lightning caused fires, burning in the very remote, steep, and inaccessible terrain in the northwest <br />
corner of the Pasayten Wilderness Area, spurred trail and area closures over the holiday weekend. Hot, dry, and windy conditions are <br />
expected today as a trough moves into the area which is expected to create conditions for increased fire behavior. The Shull, The <br />
Parks, Kid, Three Fools, Skagit, and Elbow fires, located near the Canadian-U.S border, are expected to grow in acreage today.<br />
<br />
In a joint delegation with the National Park Service, a National Incident Management Organization Team, NIMO Team 2, assumed <br />
command yesterday over the six fires now being called the NW Pasayten Fires, located in the Pasayten Wilderness on the Methow <br />
Valley Ranger District of the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest, as well as the Chilliwack Complex Fires within the North Cascades <br />
National Park Service Complex.<br />
<br />
A number of closures are in effect including an area closure for the Freezeout Creek basin and a number of trails and portions of trails <br />
in the area. Portions of both the Pacific Crest Trail and Pacific Northwest Trail remain closed at this time.<br />
<br />
Smoke from these fires, and other fires burning in the region, may impact north central Washington communities over the next few <br />
days. Take precautions when recreating outdoors when heavy smoke is present. Learn more at Real-Time Air Quality Map | PurpleAir, <br />

<br />
Update on individual NW Pasayten Fires:<br />
•     The Kid Fire, located on the ridge between Rock Creek and West Fork Pasayten, is approximately 8 miles south of the Canadian-<br />
U.S. border. The fire has been very active with spotting and torching of grouped trees. Yesterday, smokejumpers worked on protection <br />
of the historic airport cabin, situated about one quarter mile away from the Kid Fire, utilizing pumps and sprinklers. If conditions allow, <br />
smokejumpers will also be burning out unburned brush between the fire and the cabin.<br />
•     The Parks Fire is also very active. It crossed the border into Canada a couple of days ago. There is a Canadian Incident <br />
Management Team assigned to the Canadian portion (called the Heather Fire north of the border) of the Parks Fire. The fire is about <br />
one half mile from the Monument 83 Fire Lookout at the time of this release. Firefighters have prepared the lookout by wrapping the <br />
base with fire protective wrap.<br />
•    The Skagit Fire, located in Freezeout Creek 6 miles south of the border, spread northward and crossed over the top of the ridge and <br />
down the other side.<br />
•     Three Fools Fire, located 8 miles south of the border, is actively backing down the ridge and through an old burn scar, it has spotted <br />
north of the ridge. <br />
•     The Elbow Fire, located 6 miles south of the border, is actively backing down the slope near Skagit Peak.<br />
•     Tuesday, fire activity increased on the Shull Fire located 11 miles south of the border.</span>

<br />
MERLIN, Ore. – Josephine County Sheriff’s Office has reduced or eliminated the evacuation notices for some of the areas near the <br />
Rum Creek Fire. Their evacuations are based on the system of Level 1 means GET READY, Level 2 means GET SET to leave at any <br />
moment, and Level 3 means GO NOW. Areas to the east of the fire, including the communities of Merlin, Hugo, Three Pines, Leland, <br />
and Wolf Creek, are no longer under the Level 1 notification. The Level 2 to the east of Hog Creek is reduced to a Level 1.  <br />
<br />
The Level 3 in and around the fire itself and the Level 2 south of the fire have not changed. Areas north of the fire remain under a Level <br />
1 notice. For more detailed information, use the interactive map showing evacuation levels according to address at <br />
//JosephineCounty.gov/FireMap. For the most current evacuation information and resources, go to Josephine County Incident <br />
Information (rvem.org). <br />
<br />
The reduction in evacuations is possible because of progress fire personnel have made on containing the Rum Creek Fire. On the west <br />
side, the fire is considered contained from west of Mount Peavine to Galice Road north of the Galice Resort. To the northwest, fire has <br />
consumed ground fuels on most of the previously unburned interior islands. This reduces the chance of fire flaring up and escaping <br />
past the fire lines to the north or west.  <br />
<br />
On the east side, nearly all of the fire’s edge is considered contained and has stayed within its footprint. Firefighters are monitoring fire <br />
lines and have mopped up inside all lines at least 75 feet. Firefighters will patrol and monitor the fire and continue to mop up residual <br />
heat near fire edges.  No further spread is expected along these contained edges despite hot, dry, windy weather. <br />
<br />
Weather continues to be a challenge for the Rum Creek Fire. The National Weather Service has issued a combination of Red Flag <br />
Warnings and Heat Advisories through Saturday. High temperatures, low relative humidity, gusty winds, and an unstable atmosphere <br />
are expected, raising the potential for new fires to develop and existing fires to spread. Winds from the east and northeast are <br />
predicted. Personnel on the Rum Creek Fire will be monitoring the weather and fire closely, ready to take action if the fire attempts to <br />
escape the containment lines. <br />
<br />
The public is reminded to be careful with fire. Rum Creek Fire was ignited by lightning, but historically, most wildfires are human-<br />
caused. Check local fire restrictions before starting any fire or barbecue grill. Make sure all fires are completely extinguished and cold to <br />
the touch.  <br />
<br />
Evacuations: Evacuation orders and notifications have been revised.  An interactive map showing evacuation levels according to <br />
address can be found at //JosephineCounty.gov/FireMap. For the most current evacuation information and resources, go to Josephine <br />
County Incident Information (rvem.org). <br />
<br />
Road control: Josephine County Sheriff’s Office has established traffic access points around the fire zone. Road blocks are located at <br />
Galice Road near Crow Road; Galice Store; Bear Camp Road at Peavine (top intersection); Lower Grave Creek Road at Angora Creek <br />
(Grays Ranch); Quartz Creek Road about 3 miles up (end of County maintenance); Dutch Henry Road near Kelsey Creek (42 <br />
44'56.2/123 40'35.4); and Hog Creek at Galice Road. The National Guard is staffing the roadblocks. Only residents (must show proof of <br />
residency) and permitted users will be allowed through. <br />
<br />
River status: The Wild section of the Rogue River below Grave Creek will remain open unless fire conditions warrant closure. River <br />
status is determined on a day-to-day basis. Please call 541-471-6535 for more information regarding Rogue River permits. No new <br />
boating permits will be issued at this time.</span>

<br />
September 8, 2022 - 9:00 AM<br />
<br />
Plain, WA – Lightning started the White River and Irving Peak Fires on August 11. The fires are burning on the Okanogan-Wenatchee <br />
National Forest, northwest of Plain, WA.<br />
<br />
Suppression Strategy – Fire managers continue to implement a long-term strategy to manage these fires, including the use of primary <br />
and contingency perimeter lines for containment. Tactics include completion and reinforcement of fire lines using roads and constructed <br />
hand line.<br />
<br />
Current Situation – A local Type 3 Incident Management Team assumed command of the fires on September 7th at 7:00 am. Smoke <br />
may be visible over the next several weeks as interior fuels continue to smolder and burn out. Fire updates will continue every other <br />
day; if a change in fire activity occurs, the frequency may change.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Last night’s overnight infrared flight could not fly; acreage does not reflect yesterday’s growth.<br />
<br />
White River Fire – Acres: 1,576 (from 9/7/2022); 1% contained; Location: Sears Creek area of the White River drainage, approximately <br />
14 miles NW of Plain, WA.<br />
<br />
Yesterday, with Red Flag conditions and gusty winds, fire activity increased. Fire growth occurred on the southwest and southeast <br />
flanks. Two engines staffed a night shift last night to patrol and monitor activity. The fire footprint remains within the control lines and <br />
geographic features being utilized as containment lines. Firefighters continue to establish an anchor point, monitor activity, and maintain <br />
structure protection along Sears Creek Road and Windmill Lane.<br />
<br />
Irving Peak Fire – Acres: 3,062 (from 9/7/2022); 7% contained; Location: Approximately 16 miles NW of Plain, WA<br />
<br />
The Irving Peak Fire saw little growth over the last two days. Firefighters continue work along roads and containment lines and monitor <br />
fire behavior and spread utilizing ground and aerial resources.<br />
<br />
Weather – A Fire Weather Watch is possible tomorrow, Friday, September 9th, due to a wind shift bringing easterly winds and gusts up <br />
to 25mph. Over the next few days, temperatures will remain in the 70s and low 80s.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Air Quality and Smoke – Current information about air quality and health recommendations during smoky conditions is available on the <br />
Washington Smoke Blog https://wasmoke.blogspot.com/<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Closures – An emergency closure issued by the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest remains in place and can be viewed here: <br />
www.fs.usda.gov/alerts/okawen/alerts-notices. Fire managers are asking people to please respect these closures while recreating in the <br />
area. The PCT remains open and not directly impacted by the fires, but the Little Wenatchee Ford and White River Trailheads cannot <br />
be used to access the PCT.<br />
<br />
Restrictions – Campfires are not allowed anywhere within the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest. Stage 2 Restrictions are now in <br />
effect for the entire forest, including campgrounds and wilderness areas: www.fs.usda.gov/detail/okawen/alerts-notices/?<br />
cid=fsbdev3_053600.<br />
<br />
Evacuations – Current Chelan County evacuation levels include a Level 2 evacuation (Be Prepared) for Sears Creek Road and Level 1 <br />
(Stay Alert) for White River Road and Little Wenatchee Road. www.co.chelan.wa.us/emergency-management/pages/active-<br />
