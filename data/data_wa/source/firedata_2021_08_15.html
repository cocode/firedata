<br />
Black Butte Fire information:  Firefighters made good progress yesterday and were able to construct containment <br />
line along the eastern edge of the fire. Along the eastern edge of the fire, crews will continue mop-up 50ft plus on <br />
all lines. They will be holding and securing control lines where fire has reached the line. Protecting private lands <br />
and structures at Flag Prairie is a priority.<br />
<br />
Along the southern edge of the fire, air resources will be used to limit fire spread east of the North Fork Malheur <br />
River. Hand crews will continue to work to do direct line construction along the southern fire edge and develop <br />
indirect lines as appropriate with equipment support. Crews will also be holding and securing the fire edge and <br />
spot fires to mitigate further spread to the south along with continuing mop-up along control lines.<br />
<br />
To the west, crews will scout and construct direct and alternative line on the south side of road 832. Crews will <br />
also conduct fire operations as needed along control lines. They will continue the prep of control lines and <br />
implement burnout operations as needed. Mop-up operations will continue on control lines. Crews will prep on <br />
road 16 and hold established handline into North Fork Malheur River area to control fire spread to the north.<br />
<br />
Glacier Fire: The Glacier fire remains at 75 acres and shows minimal activity. Firefighters continue to monitor the <br />
fire for activity. Steep terrain and hazard trees are safety concerns for suppression activities.<br />
<br />
Aviation: Air assets include four Type 1 heavy helicopters, one medium Type 2 helicopters and two Type 3 <br />
helicopters, along with an assigned Air Attack for aerial reconnaissance of both the Black Butte and Glacier fires.<br />
<br />
Weather and Air Quality: Critical fire weather continues today with sunny, hot and dry conditions. Smoke will <br />
provide some shading of the fire and keeping temperatures down several degrees, but temperatures will remain <br />
in the mid 90’s throughout the weekend. Upslope winds today at 2-5 mph will become NW 3-5 mph with gusts to <br />
15 mph this afternoon. Winds will be terrain driven, come from different directions, swirl around topographic <br />
features, with possible direction reversals. Relative humidity will have poor recovery overnight at higher <br />
elevations.<br />
<br />
Smoke impacts from the Black Butte Fire and others in the region are present. For more information regarding air <br />
quality and smoke forecast, please visit  Oregon Smoke Blog Spot at www.oregonsmoke.blogspot.com  and  Fire <br />
Air Now at www.fire.airnow.gov.<br />
<br />
Closures: The Big Creek Campground is closed on the Malheur National Forest as of August 8, 2021. For <br />
updated Forest closure information, please go to the Forest webpage at www.fs.usda.gov/malheur or follow the <br />
Forest Facebook.<br />
<br />
Northwest 6 Incident Command Team will take command of the Black Butte Fire tomorrow morning at 0700.</span>

Overview:The Bull Complex has experienced moderate growth over the last several days.The most active part of the <br />
complex is with the Janus, Ridge, and Kola Fires as they are burning in the steep and rugged terrain of the Bull of the <br />
Woods Wilderness. The number one priority for all firefighting operations is firefighter and public safety. Full <br />
suppression strategies continue to be a key objective on the Bull Complex to extinguish and limit fire spread.   <br />
<br />
Current Situation: Fire crews continue to work to the south and southeast of Janus, Ridge, and Kola Fires mitigating the <br />
vegetation along Forest Road 6370. Crews will be working on the west side of the fire along Forest Road 4696 <br />
improving containment lines and identifying and removing snags along the line. Snags are dead, standing trees that <br />
present a significant hazard to firefighters, as they typically burn more quickly and increase the risk of injury to <br />
firefighters.  <br />
<br />
Crews will be working on the north side of the fire along Forest Road 63 and south to Forest Road 6370 near Ogre <br />
Creek to improve containment lines. Firefighters are utilizing previous burn scars to limit the spread of the fire to the <br />
northwest.   Weather: The Excessive Heat Warning is still in effect until 10 p.m., Saturday. Weather conditions continue <br />
to be hot and dry with temperatures hovering around 100 degrees. Increased fire behavior continues as relative <br />
humidity remains low combined with hot daytime temperatures.   <br />
<br />
Smoke will continue to remain over the fire area and will be visible throughout the area. Affected communities should <br />
remain aware of smoke advisories and conditions. More information can be found at - www.airnow.gov or the Oregon <br />
Smoke Blog - https://oregonsmoke.blogspot.com/?m=1   <br />
<br />

<br />
Bulldog Mountain Fire:  Yesterday firefighters were assisted on the ground by the dense smoke over the fire <br />
which helped moderate fire activity.  This allowed firefighters to make good progress on establishing indirect and <br />
contingency containment lines around the entire fire area.  Crews utilized heavy equipment to remove fuel from <br />
indirect and contingency lines.  Falling crews worked to remove dangerous trees and snags so firefighters can <br />
work safely in and around the fire.  No aircraft were able to fly due to the smoky conditions. <br />
<br />
Today crews will continue to finish up indirect containment lines around the fire.  Firefighters expect the fire to <br />
reach Forest Service Rd 6110 today.  This road has been prepared as an indirect fire line and crews will be <br />
prepared to suppress the fire as it reaches the road.  Helicopters will be used if smoke conditions allow.<br />
<br />
The Bulldog Mountain Fire started August 5. 2021, located 20 miles north of Kettle Falls. The lightning caused <br />
fire spread quickly due to low relative humidity and unseasonably dry conditions.  The fire is burning in heavy <br />
timber and slash.  The fire is currently estimated at 2900 acres with 5% containment.<br />
<br />
Mack Mountain Fire:  The Mack Mountain Fire started August 5, 2021 and is just south west of the Bulldog <br />
Mountain Fire.  The fire is still relatively small but it has grown to approximately 50 acres.  Residents in the <br />
Deadman Creek area may see smoke from the fire.  The fire area is located in steep, rugged terrain with limited <br />
access.  Fire managers are planning for future action when appropriate and more resources become available.<br />
<br />
Citizens should remain vigilant and are strongly encouraged to sign up for alerts at Ferry County Alerts.  <br />
Motorists traveling on the Boulder Hwy should be vigilant and watch for heavy equipment and firefighters turning <br />
off and onto the roadway.  There are 185 personnel assigned to the incident. There have been two minor injuries <br />
with no structures lost.  Firefighter and public safety is our number one priority.  <br />
<br />
Level 1 evacuation orders and road closures are in place. For current evacuation orders please see Ferry County <br />
Sheriff’s Office Facebook page.  Boulder Creek Hwy and State Route 395 remain open.  For information on area <br />
& road closures on the Colville National Forest please see <br />
https://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fseprd938379.pdf   Citizens are asked to stay clear of the <br />
fire area and adhere to road and area closures. <br />
<br />
Northeast Washington Interagency Incident Management Team 2 (NEWIMT2) assumed command of the fire <br />
August 7th at 11:00 a.m.  <br />
<br />
Fire information and the incident command post is located at Kettle Falls High School in Kettle Falls, WA. Fire <br />

Winthrop, WA — The Cedar Creek, Cub Creek 2 and Delancy Fires are burning on the Okanogan-Wenatchee <br />
National Forest and public and private lands within Okanogan County. <br />
<br />
Cedar Creek Fire: The fire has been mapped at 53,215 acres, slightly less than previously reported, and is 50% <br />
contained. Forward spread on the north and southeast flanks of the fire has been halted. Firefighters are now <br />
focused on securing lines on the southern and western edges of the fire to keep the fire from threatening <br />
residences in the Twisp River drainage. As a contingency, in the Canyon Creek area work is continuing on the <br />
shaded fuel break on the north side of the Twisp River. This is expected to be completed within the next few <br />
days. When completed, shaded fuel breaks will extend along the north side of the Twisp River from Deer Creek <br />
south to Bridge Creek, from Twisp River north along Canyon Creek and the 050 Road, and following Bridge <br />
Creek to the 092 Road. On the north end, just west of the Early Winter Campground, crews have set up sprinkler <br />
systems to extinguish pockets of heat in an area too dangerous to insert firefighters due to multiple unstable <br />
dead trees. The sprinklers are running continuously. Fire crews have made substantial progress improving <br />
control lines in the Vasiliki Ridge area. Air operations continue at Patterson Lake. The lake is closed, but flights <br />
have been disrupted several times by citizens attempting to access the lake. Being under a working helicopter is <br />
dangerous. If you enter the area, the aircraft will be pulled off for your safety, and work on the fire will be delayed. <br />
Please give firefighting aircraft room to work. <br />
<br />
Cub Creek 2 Fire: The Cub Creek Fire is 66,883 acres and 55% contained. The fire is growing slowly to the north <br />
and west, burning actively both night and day. Firefighters have been focusing on preparing the area around the <br />
Brevicomis cabins off the 51 Road. The Honeymoon Campground area is another area of concern. Several spot <br />
fires have been discovered there just over the line. Crews have been working to extinguish those spots and are <br />
making good progress. Many areas with open line are backing slowly down hill consuming surface fuels and <br />
occasionally torching single trees. On the ridge tops in areas with continuous fuels sustained crown runs were <br />
observed yesterday and are likely to occur as the winds change this weekend. Suppression repair is also in <br />
progress. Hazard trees are being identified and removed along the fire’s edge. There are currently 330 <br />
firefighters assigned to the incident. <br />
<br />
Delancy Fire: The Delancy is 223 acres, is being actively monitored, but is unstaffed. Fire Weather: An Excessive <br />
Heat Warning has been declared for Saturday. The current weather pattern will be changing over the weekend. <br />
As a ridge of high pressure moves off to the east westerly ridge top winds will be picking up in the afternoon <br />
clearing smoke and increasing visibility. The clear air will allow the fuel to heat up as it is exposed to sunlight. <br />
This will bring more active fire behavior. Evacuations: The community of Mazama (west) remains in a Level 2 <br />
evacuation status. Resources for additional information:</span>

<br />
Firefighters are working around the clock to suppress the fires. As with all wildfires, the Incident Management <br />
Team is using a range of firefighting tactics to suppress the fire. Crews are conducting structure assessments, so <br />
fire personnel know where structures are located and are removing vegetation and debris to decrease the fuel <br />
load. This is an important tactic to provide structure protection. <br />
<br />
Walker Creek Fire: Structure protection continued through the night as firefighters removed vegetation and any <br />
materials that could threaten structures.  In the northern area of the fire, dozers are constructing fire line to <br />
remove fuel. Work today will include constructing fireline from the fires end down to Bonaparte Lake, continued <br />
construction and improvement of containment and contingency lines, and scouting for spot fires. <br />
Spur Fire: The fire pushed outside the northern containment line and was suppressed by crews and equipment.  <br />
Spot fires outside containment lines were also detected and suppressed utilizing engines, dozers, and hand <br />
crews. Smoke hampered aerial resources; but they remain available when conditions improve. Today’s activities <br />
will focus preparing Road 33, structure protection and suppressing new spot fires.<br />
<br />
Chickadee Creek Fire: Fire Personnel continue to work on increasing containment of the fire with the help of <br />
engine crews, working to enforce the line, and putting out any spot fires or hotspots along the line. Personnel will <br />
continue to look for hot spots and assist where needed. <br />
<br />

Winthrop, WA — The Cedar Creek, Cub Creek 2 and Delancy Fires are burning on the Okanogan-Wenatchee <br />
National Forest and public and private lands within Okanogan County. <br />
<br />
Cedar Creek Fire: The fire has been mapped at 53,215 acres, slightly less than previously reported, and is 50% <br />
contained. Forward spread on the north and southeast flanks of the fire has been halted. Firefighters are now <br />
focused on securing lines on the southern and western edges of the fire to keep the fire from threatening <br />
residences in the Twisp River drainage. As a contingency, in the Canyon Creek area work is continuing on the <br />
shaded fuel break on the north side of the Twisp River. This is expected to be completed within the next few <br />
days. When completed, shaded fuel breaks will extend along the north side of the Twisp River from Deer Creek <br />
south to Bridge Creek, from Twisp River north along Canyon Creek and the 050 Road, and following Bridge <br />
Creek to the 092 Road. On the north end, just west of the Early Winter Campground, crews have set up sprinkler <br />
systems to extinguish pockets of heat in an area too dangerous to insert firefighters due to multiple unstable <br />
dead trees. The sprinklers are running continuously. Fire crews have made substantial progress improving <br />
control lines in the Vasiliki Ridge area. Air operations continue at Patterson Lake. The lake is closed, but flights <br />
have been disrupted several times by citizens attempting to access the lake. Being under a working helicopter is <br />
dangerous. If you enter the area, the aircraft will be pulled off for your safety, and work on the fire will be delayed. <br />
Please give firefighting aircraft room to work. <br />
<br />
Cub Creek 2 Fire: The Cub Creek Fire is 66,883 acres and 55% contained. The fire is growing slowly to the north <br />
and west, burning actively both night and day. Firefighters have been focusing on preparing the area around the <br />
Brevicomis cabins off the 51 Road. The Honeymoon Campground area is another area of concern. Several spot <br />
fires have been discovered there just over the line. Crews have been working to extinguish those spots and are <br />
making good progress. Many areas with open line are backing slowly down hill consuming surface fuels and <br />
occasionally torching single trees. On the ridge tops in areas with continuous fuels sustained crown runs were <br />
observed yesterday and are likely to occur as the winds change this weekend. Suppression repair is also in <br />
progress. Hazard trees are being identified and removed along the fire’s edge. There are currently 330 <br />
firefighters assigned to the incident. <br />
<br />
Delancy Fire: The Delancy is 223 acres, is being actively monitored, but is unstaffed. Fire Weather: An Excessive <br />
Heat Warning has been declared for Saturday. The current weather pattern will be changing over the weekend. <br />
As a ridge of high pressure moves off to the east westerly ridge top winds will be picking up in the afternoon <br />
clearing smoke and increasing visibility. The clear air will allow the fuel to heat up as it is exposed to sunlight. <br />
This will bring more active fire behavior. Evacuations: The community of Mazama (west) remains in a Level 2 <br />
evacuation status. Resources for additional information:</span>

***Notice of Public Meeting at the Tiller Volunteer Fire District, Today (Saturday), August 14th, 7:30 PM*** <br />
<br />
***An Excessive Heat Warning is in effect today for all of southwest Oregon *** <br />
<br />
The Devil's Knob Complex is a group of lightning-caused fires with the majority burning on the Tiller Ranger <br />
District, Umpqua National Forest and several fires burning on private lands protected by Douglas Forest <br />
Protective Association. The Devil’s Knob Complex is situated between the Rough Patch Complex and Jack Fire <br />
to the north, which is being managed by Northwest Incident Management Team 13 and the Skyline Ridge <br />
Complex to the southwest, which is being managed by Oregon Department of Forestry Team 1. The Devil's Knob <br />
Complex is managed by Northwest Incident Management Team 8 from an incident command post at the Milo <br />
Academy near Tiller, Oregon.    <br />
<br />
General Updates:  As fires become contained and mopped up in the southern portion of the Complex, resources <br />
are being relocated to the central and northern portions of the Complex to other priority fires. Fourteen fires <br />
within the Complex are considered contained, controlled or out.   Two burnouts are planned for Big Hamlin Fire <br />
today if the conditions remain favorable. The first burnout will be on the northeast flank in the morning with the <br />
goal of bringing fire down to Jackson Creek and the second burnout will be on the southeast flank to secure <br />
containment lines.  <br />
<br />
The following is a summary of the significant fire activity over the fire complex starting from north to south: <br />
<br />
Smith Fire – 966 acres – roll-out of burning material has resulted in some spotting across Dumont Road.  <br />
Consequently, contingency line options are being explored farther east and west in case current containment <br />
efforts are not successful. A heavy equipment group is nearing completion of indirect containment line running <br />
from the north-northwest flank down south to tie into the Dumont Road.  <br />
<br />
Mule Creek Fire – 1,022 acres – mop up operations will continue. <br />
<br />
Big Hamlin Fire – 4,552 acres – mop up along the western flank continues.  Spot fires in front of the northeast <br />
corner of the fire continue to grow; indirect line is being constructed to contain this portion of the fire and the rest <br />
of the east flank.  A new division (Division F) has been established to the east of the fire with the purpose of <br />
opening old fire lines built for the Whiskey Fire (2013) to be used as containment lines.  Preparations are <br />
underway to burn out portions of indirect line.   <br />
<br />
Little Applegate Fire – 135 acres – currently holding in the existing footprint; containment line construction will <br />
continue and is nearing completion.   <br />
<br />
Wildcat Fire – 215 acres – fire is staying in the same footprint and mop up operations will continue. Numerous <br />
green and dead trees have been falling outside containment lines but no spot fires have resulted.  An unstaffed <br />
sprinkler system has been effective and will continue to be operated in areas too hazardous for firefighters. <br />
<br />
Section 30 (Railroad) Fire – 76 acres – has been completely contained.  Resources will be patrolling the area. <br />
<br />
Dismal Creek (444) Fire – 40 acres – has been contained and is in patrol status.  <br />
<br />
The firefighting resources on the Devil's Knob Complex are also responsible for conducting initial attack <br />
operations on the entire Tiller Ranger District and private land holdings. Firefighters are prepared to respond to <br />
any initial fire starts.</span>

<br />
Lakeview, Ore.  –  The Fox Complex, which includes the Patton Meadow and Willow Valley fires, is now under <br />
the unified command of Oregon Department of Forestry’s Incident Management Team 3 and Oregon State Fire <br />
Marshal’s Blue Team.<br />
<br />
The arrival of the two teams brings in additional overhead capacity and firefighting resources. The teams are <br />
setting up their incident command post at the Lake County Fairgrounds and working on arrangements for a <br />
forward operating base for crews and amenities to support them.<br />
<br />
The Patton Meadow Fire is burning on the Fremont-Winema National Forest and private lands protected by the <br />
Oregon Department of Forestry about 10 miles west of Lakeview. Fire behavior picked up overnight as winds out <br />
of the north pushed the fire over and to the south of Highway 140 and west of the 383 road. Night crews and <br />
dozers were able to corral the fire in both areas and will continue to strengthen those lines throughout today. <br />
Current mapping shows the fire at about 4,100 acres.<br />
<br />
OSFM’s Blue Team is supporting the effort by providing structure protection around homes along Hwy 140 with 7 <br />
structural taskforces and 2 more taskforces arriving today. The crews will assess homes, create defensible space <br />
around the homes when feasible, and assist wildland firefighting crews in creating containment lines that will help <br />
protect structures.<br />
<br />
The Willow Valley Fire, about 16 miles south of Bonanza, is estimated at about 770 acres. The fire is burning <br />
mostly on Bureau of Land Management (BLM) Lakeview District lands north of the Stateline, as well as part of <br />
the Modoc National Forest to the south.  ODF protected lands are threatened. No structures are threatened on <br />
the Willow Valley Fire.<br />
<br />
With the teams still getting established, resources are on order and beginning to trickle in. Four large, type 1 <br />
helicopters are also expected to arrive this afternoon.<br />
<br />
Lake County Sheriff’s Office is managing evacuation levels. Level 1, 2 and 3 evacuation notifications are in place <br />
within and around the fire area. Stay up to date on evacuation levels by visiting https://www.facebook.com/Lake-<br />

<br />
Current Situation: Green Ridge Fire: Yesterday, the Green Ridge Fire pushed south to the west side of Mount <br />
Misery, increasing the total acres to 32,298.  The fire remains 15% contained. Crews have been patrolling and <br />
improving lines on the north and west sides of the fire in Divisions G, K, and M. Crews and bulldozers continued <br />
strengthening contingency lines along roads and ridges north of the 22 (4022) Road yesterday. Fire activity was <br />
minimal in Division M on the north edge of the fire where successful firing operations took place earlier this week. <br />
On Saturday, firefighters continued to scout for possible contingency lines south of the Green Ridge and Lick <br />
Creek Fires.<br />
<br />
Today, crews will continue patrolling and strengthening lines in Divisions G, K, and M on the west and north sides <br />
of the fire. Hand crews and heavy equipment will continue to be used to secure contingency lines to the north in <br />
Division H and to the southeast of the Green Ridge fire perimeter. Firefighters are looking for roads, ridges, or <br />
other natural features that can be improved to create fire lines in the coming days. Winds out of the northwest <br />
are expected to push the fire southeast as it follows the terrain.<br />
<br />
Current Situation: Lick Creek Fire: The Lick Creek fire remains 80,421 acres and 96% contained, with the <br />
remaining 4% of unsecured line on West Mountain Road on the southeast portion of the fire. The Lick Creek Fire <br />
currently has one Type 4 engine, one Type 6 engine, one bulldozer, one tactical water tender, and 8 support <br />
water tenders assigned to the incident. With the low relative humidity and dry fuels, smoldering and torching <br />
within the fire’s interior will continue. On Saturday, crews detected a spot fire outside of the Lick Creek Fire <br />
perimeter and were able to successfully insert resources into the area and stop its spread. Crews will continue to <br />
improve and monitor the containment lines, shifting to help firefighting efforts on Green Ridge where needed.<br />
<br />
Weather & Smoke Information: Winds are expected to increase this afternoon, with 8-12 mph winds from the <br />
west to northwest, with gusts to 17 mph. Little change in the temperature and humidity is expected today; hot <br />
and dry conditions are expected to continue. Temperatures will be 85-90 degrees along the ridges and in the <br />
mid-90s in the valley bottoms. Smoke will continue to be dense throughout the day. Smoke information is <br />
available on Washington Smoke Blog at: https://wasmoke.blogspot.com/<br />
<br />
Forest Closures: Closures are in place on the Umatilla National Forest. The forest closure for some areas on the <br />
Umatilla NF have been amended. The amended order reopens most Umatilla NF lands in Oregon. The order <br />
also closes all lands on the Walla Walla Ranger District in Washington; forest lands in the Pomeroy Ranger <br />
District will remain closed to entry. the order is available at https://go.usa.gov/xFyhn.<br />
<br />
Evacuations: Garfield County currently has Level 1, 2 and 3 evacuations in place. Level 1 evacuations were <br />
added on Thursday for Grouse Flats in southern Garfield County. For more information on evacuations in <br />
Garfield County, please visit https://go.usa.gov/xFyM4. Columbia County currently has Level 3, Level 2, and <br />
Level 1 evacuations in place. Wallowa County, Oregon currently has Level 1 evacuations in place for Grouse <br />
Flats. An interactive fire map that shows evacuations and other important information is available at <br />
https://tinyurl.com/yv2sypd4.<br />
<br />
Temporary Flight Restrictions: A Temporary Flight Restriction is in place over the Green Ridge Fire and Lick <br />
Creek Fire. Wildfires are a No Drone Zone. If you fly, we can’t. Whenever a drone is spotted near the fire all <br />
aircraft are grounded until we can be sure the drone is clear of the area. For more information, visit <br />

Successful ignitions Thursday and Friday have secured approximately 4 miles of containment line across the <br />
Rough Patch Complex and Jack Fire footprints. Firefighters also continue to reinforce lines and assess line <br />
locations to strengthen perimeters. <br />
Great Basin Team 2, a Type 1 Incident Management Team led by Tony DeMasters, will assume command of the <br />
Rough Patch Complex and Jack Fire suppression Sunday. Incoming fire managers are shadowing NW13 <br />
managers today to familiarize themselves with the operations on the ground. <br />
<br />
A key objective is to secure about 15 miles of line to prevent the Chaos Fire from moving farther west or south. <br />
Operations on the Chilcoot Fire are now in patrol status. Throughout the fire zones, firefighters are working to <br />
secure and reinforce about 70 miles of primary, alternate and contingency line, while also suppressing slopovers <br />
and spot fires.<br />
<br />
Fire activity was subdued Friday due to cloud cover and smoke. Those are forecasted to lift Saturday, creating <br />
the potential for robust fire behavior over the weekend. Temperatures will be in the 90s, tapering into the high <br />
80s Monday. <br />
<br />
Friday, the Umpqua and Willamette National Forests updated existing closure orders to encompass the Rough <br />
Patch, Jack, Archie Creek and Devil's Knob Fire Areas. This includes Canton Creek Campground, Musick Guard <br />
Station and Cover Campground.<br />
<br />
Roseburg District Bureau of Land Management has expanded its closure area to include the Scaredman <br />
Recreation Site. Francis Creek Road from the junction with Canton Creek Road north to the district boundary has <br />
been closed since Aug. 5.</span>

Middle Fork Complex & Knoll Fire Update – Saturday, August 14, 2021 – 9:00 am <br />
<br />
Smoke yesterday moderated fire activity despite the hot and dry weather. <br />
<br />
Kwis Fire: Strategic burning operations were conducted along the containment line from Forest Road 207 to <br />
Forest Road 5871. Today, crews will continue installing a sprinkler system and water tenders will assist in wetting <br />
areas where crews conducted strategic burning. Mop up and patrols along completed line are ongoing and heavy <br />
equipment is working on constructing alternative containment lines. Firefighters will continue night work and <br />
patrols on the Kwis fire as well. <br />
<br />
Kwis Fire Structure Protection: Structure crews from OSFM continued supporting fire operations on the Kwis and <br />
the Gale fires.  Firefighters provided structure triage and defensible space for structures and homes on private <br />
land east of the Gale Fire in the Level 3 Evacuation Zone.   Structure crews have also completed over 471 home <br />
assessments in Oakridge and the Level 2 Evacuation Zone and are working to complete all assessments in <br />
these areas today.  <br />
<br />
Knoll Fire: Containment on the Knoll fire has increased with expectations for containment percentages to keep <br />
increasing. The fire continues to remain within its existing footprint.  Firefighters have successfully held the fire <br />
west of Highway 126 and mop up work is ongoing. There may be increased smoke as unburned islands of forest <br />
within the fire perimeter are naturally consumed.   <br />
<br />
Gales and Ninemile Fires: With the successes on Kwis and Knoll Fires, more heavy equipment and other <br />
resources are being routed to Gales and Ninemile. Firefighters are resuming the previous efforts to construct the <br />
indirect containment lines. The equipment will also be utilized to prepare the Forest Road 18, which will be used <br />
to move equipment and other resources to both fires.   Strategic burning operations will be implemented as <br />
conditions allow.  <br />
<br />
Weather and Smoke: Some instability will linger Saturday, such that a slight potential for deep vertical plume <br />
growth will remain, however the threat will be reduced compared to Friday. Morning humidity recoveries are <br />
expected, with daytime drying similar to  previous days. For current air quality information, visit <br />
oakridgeair.org/smoke or the Oregon Smoke Blog oregonsmoke.blogspot.com/.  <br />
<br />
Evacuations: Level 1, 2 and 3 evacuation notices have been issued by Lane County. For current evacuation <br />
information and an interactive map of evacuation areas, visit: www.lanecounty.org.  <br />
<br />
Closures: Some National Forest System lands near the Middle Fork Complex and Knoll fires are temporarily <br />
closed to provide for public safety. For more information visit www.fs.usda.gov/willamette. The Oregon State <br />
Marine Board issued a temporary closure on a portion of the McKenzie River, for more information visit: <br />

<br />
Current Situation: Green Ridge Fire: Yesterday, the Green Ridge Fire pushed south to the west side of Mount <br />
Misery, increasing the total acres to 32,298.  The fire remains 15% contained. Crews have been patrolling and <br />
improving lines on the north and west sides of the fire in Divisions G, K, and M. Crews and bulldozers continued <br />
strengthening contingency lines along roads and ridges north of the 22 (4022) Road yesterday. Fire activity was <br />
minimal in Division M on the north edge of the fire where successful firing operations took place earlier this week. <br />
On Saturday, firefighters continued to scout for possible contingency lines south of the Green Ridge and Lick <br />
Creek Fires.<br />
<br />
Today, crews will continue patrolling and strengthening lines in Divisions G, K, and M on the west and north sides <br />
of the fire. Hand crews and heavy equipment will continue to be used to secure contingency lines to the north in <br />
Division H and to the southeast of the Green Ridge fire perimeter. Firefighters are looking for roads, ridges, or <br />
other natural features that can be improved to create fire lines in the coming days. Winds out of the northwest <br />
are expected to push the fire southeast as it follows the terrain.<br />
<br />
Current Situation: Lick Creek Fire: The Lick Creek fire remains 80,421 acres and 96% contained, with the <br />
remaining 4% of unsecured line on West Mountain Road on the southeast portion of the fire. The Lick Creek Fire <br />
currently has one Type 4 engine, one Type 6 engine, one bulldozer, one tactical water tender, and 8 support <br />
water tenders assigned to the incident. With the low relative humidity and dry fuels, smoldering and torching <br />
within the fire’s interior will continue. On Saturday, crews detected a spot fire outside of the Lick Creek Fire <br />
perimeter and were able to successfully insert resources into the area and stop its spread. Crews will continue to <br />
improve and monitor the containment lines, shifting to help firefighting efforts on Green Ridge where needed.<br />
<br />
Weather & Smoke Information: Winds are expected to increase this afternoon, with 8-12 mph winds from the <br />
west to northwest, with gusts to 17 mph. Little change in the temperature and humidity is expected today; hot <br />
and dry conditions are expected to continue. Temperatures will be 85-90 degrees along the ridges and in the <br />
mid-90s in the valley bottoms. Smoke will continue to be dense throughout the day. Smoke information is <br />
available on Washington Smoke Blog at: https://wasmoke.blogspot.com/<br />
<br />
Forest Closures: Closures are in place on the Umatilla National Forest. The forest closure for some areas on the <br />
Umatilla NF have been amended. The amended order reopens most Umatilla NF lands in Oregon. The order <br />
also closes all lands on the Walla Walla Ranger District in Washington; forest lands in the Pomeroy Ranger <br />
District will remain closed to entry. the order is available at https://go.usa.gov/xFyhn.<br />
<br />
Evacuations: Garfield County currently has Level 1, 2 and 3 evacuations in place. Level 1 evacuations were <br />
added on Thursday for Grouse Flats in southern Garfield County. For more information on evacuations in <br />
Garfield County, please visit https://go.usa.gov/xFyM4. Columbia County currently has Level 3, Level 2, and <br />
Level 1 evacuations in place. Wallowa County, Oregon currently has Level 1 evacuations in place for Grouse <br />
Flats. An interactive fire map that shows evacuations and other important information is available at <br />
https://tinyurl.com/yv2sypd4.<br />
<br />
Temporary Flight Restrictions: A Temporary Flight Restriction is in place over the Green Ridge Fire and Lick <br />
Creek Fire. Wildfires are a No Drone Zone. If you fly, we can’t. Whenever a drone is spotted near the fire all <br />
aircraft are grounded until we can be sure the drone is clear of the area. For more information, visit <br />

Middle Fork Complex & Knoll Fire Update – Saturday, August 14, 2021 – 9:00 am <br />
<br />
Smoke yesterday moderated fire activity despite the hot and dry weather. <br />
<br />
Kwis Fire: Strategic burning operations were conducted along the containment line from Forest Road 207 to <br />
Forest Road 5871. Today, crews will continue installing a sprinkler system and water tenders will assist in wetting <br />
areas where crews conducted strategic burning. Mop up and patrols along completed line are ongoing and heavy <br />
equipment is working on constructing alternative containment lines. Firefighters will continue night work and <br />
patrols on the Kwis fire as well. <br />
<br />
Kwis Fire Structure Protection: Structure crews from OSFM continued supporting fire operations on the Kwis and <br />
the Gale fires.  Firefighters provided structure triage and defensible space for structures and homes on private <br />
land east of the Gale Fire in the Level 3 Evacuation Zone.   Structure crews have also completed over 471 home <br />
assessments in Oakridge and the Level 2 Evacuation Zone and are working to complete all assessments in <br />
these areas today.  <br />
<br />
Knoll Fire: Containment on the Knoll fire has increased with expectations for containment percentages to keep <br />
increasing. The fire continues to remain within its existing footprint.  Firefighters have successfully held the fire <br />
west of Highway 126 and mop up work is ongoing. There may be increased smoke as unburned islands of forest <br />
within the fire perimeter are naturally consumed.   <br />
<br />
Gales and Ninemile Fires: With the successes on Kwis and Knoll Fires, more heavy equipment and other <br />
resources are being routed to Gales and Ninemile. Firefighters are resuming the previous efforts to construct the <br />
indirect containment lines. The equipment will also be utilized to prepare the Forest Road 18, which will be used <br />
to move equipment and other resources to both fires.   Strategic burning operations will be implemented as <br />
conditions allow.  <br />
<br />
Weather and Smoke: Some instability will linger Saturday, such that a slight potential for deep vertical plume <br />
growth will remain, however the threat will be reduced compared to Friday. Morning humidity recoveries are <br />
expected, with daytime drying similar to  previous days. For current air quality information, visit <br />
oakridgeair.org/smoke or the Oregon Smoke Blog oregonsmoke.blogspot.com/.  <br />
<br />
Evacuations: Level 1, 2 and 3 evacuation notices have been issued by Lane County. For current evacuation <br />
information and an interactive map of evacuation areas, visit: www.lanecounty.org.  <br />
<br />
Closures: Some National Forest System lands near the Middle Fork Complex and Knoll fires are temporarily <br />
closed to provide for public safety. For more information visit www.fs.usda.gov/willamette. The Oregon State <br />
Marine Board issued a temporary closure on a portion of the McKenzie River, for more information visit: <br />

<br />
Start Date: August 4, 2021    Cause: Lightning    Size: 1,648 acres    Containment: 5% Location: Approximately <br />
three miles northeast of Conconully Resources Assigned:  84 personnel   Current Situation: Crews were able to <br />
build an initial line around the perimeter of the Muckamuck Fire and will be working on improving that line in the <br />
coming days.  Terrain and weather conditions have provided an opportunity for crews to mop up the north side of <br />
the fire to gain 5% containment. All spot fires from the previous day were able to be contained and mopped up. <br />
Due to smoke in the area there was limited air support. Night patrols will continue over the next couple days. <br />
Previous night shifts have focused on laying hose on the north side.  The fire has remained active at night with <br />
group trees torching as late as 2 a.m. with ember movements, but no new spots.<br />
<br />
Today, with the arrival of additional resources direct attack as well as contingency line contstruction will take <br />
place. The SE portion towards Muckamuck Pass will be priority today with morning operations preparing for the <br />
wind shifting from the west today. Westerly winds are expected to blow smoke into the area. This may bring <br />
visibility below the minimum level for air support to safely fly.  <br />
<br />
Weather: The weather will begin to turn cooler with winds coming in from the west by midday. This will lead to <br />
more smoke over the Muckamuck Fire and Okanogan Valley. It is expected to lift in the Valley by evening.   <br />
<br />
Closures and Restrictions: Closure Order: 06-21-09-21-10 Southern Cub Creek 2 issued by the Colville National <br />
Forest has closed numerous areas, trails, and roads in and around the fire area <br />
<br />
Evacuations: Level One: Mineral Hill, Conconully, West Fork-Conconully <br />
<br />
Level Three: Salmon Meadows-Kerr Public Use <br />

 Orient, WA - The Nine Mine Fire is located 4.5 miles south / southeast from Laurier, WA. This lightning caused <br />
fire started on Wednesday, August 4th and has burned approximately 157 acres of forested land. Acreage growth <br />
is based on burnout operations.<br />
<br />
Evacuations: This morning Level 2 evacuation, for ONLY 3733 A-Z, N. Sand Creek Rd ONLY. This is due to <br />
weather, fire behavior and burnout operations.<br />
<br />
The remaining Sand Creek addresses and Imperial Way will remain under level 1 evacuation.<br />
<br />
Road Closures: Nine Mine Rd. has been reopened to traffic. Use caution if driving this road and watch for fire <br />
traffic.<br />
<br />
Yesterday, firefighters successfully initiating planned burnout operations along the NW section of division Alpha.  <br />
Containment lines from division Whiskey to division Alpha were completed and reinforced prior to burnout <br />
operations. Zulu division has been moped up 150’ and has been put into a patrol status. <br />
<br />
Overnight an IR flight was completed. The aircraft is equipped with the ability to Infrared scan the entire burn <br />
area and map fire hot spots within containment lines. This helps fire managers place resources in the areas that <br />
need attention.<br />
 <br />
Today, Firefighter’s mission today will be mop up of the burnout area from yesterday’s operations.  Division Z will <br />
be in a patrol status while mop up continues in division W.<br />
<br />
   Sunny skies and hot temperatures with low relative humidity today, along with gusty afternoon winds can <br />
change fire behavior and will be monitored throughout the day.<br />

Successful ignitions Thursday and Friday have secured approximately 4 miles of containment line across the <br />
Rough Patch Complex and Jack Fire footprints. Firefighters also continue to reinforce lines and assess line <br />
locations to strengthen perimeters. <br />
Great Basin Team 2, a Type 1 Incident Management Team led by Tony DeMasters, will assume command of the <br />
Rough Patch Complex and Jack Fire suppression Sunday. Incoming fire managers are shadowing NW13 <br />
managers today to familiarize themselves with the operations on the ground. <br />
<br />
A key objective is to secure about 15 miles of line to prevent the Chaos Fire from moving farther west or south. <br />
Operations on the Chilcoot Fire are now in patrol status. Throughout the fire zones, firefighters are working to <br />
secure and reinforce about 70 miles of primary, alternate and contingency line, while also suppressing slopovers <br />
and spot fires.<br />
<br />
Fire activity was subdued Friday due to cloud cover and smoke. Those are forecasted to lift Saturday, creating <br />
the potential for robust fire behavior over the weekend. Temperatures will be in the 90s, tapering into the high <br />
80s Monday. <br />
<br />
Friday, the Umpqua and Willamette National Forests updated existing closure orders to encompass the Rough <br />
Patch, Jack, Archie Creek and Devil's Knob Fire Areas. This includes Canton Creek Campground, Musick Guard <br />
Station and Cover Campground.<br />
<br />
Roseburg District Bureau of Land Management has expanded its closure area to include the Scaredman <br />
Recreation Site. Francis Creek Road from the junction with Canton Creek Road north to the district boundary has <br />
been closed since Aug. 5.</span>

Yesterday: Additional firefighting resources arrived at the Schneider Springs Fire in the form of strike teams of <br />
engines and crews, with more expected to check-in through the weekend. The fire started the day at 13,665 <br />
acres with extensive smoke blanketing the area. Firefighters worked on scouting and assessing both the <br />
Bumping River drainage and the Highway 410 corridor, mapping structures and assessing properties for potential <br />
placement of hoses and lines when needed. Crews were also able to wrap the Little Bald Mountain repeater to <br />
help mitigate the chance for broken radio communication during the fire event. The Little Bald Mountain Repeater <br />
is utilized by local fire, police and EMS as well as the Forest Service. One firefighter suffered a heat-related <br />
illness and was treated and released by a local hospital.<br />
 <br />
Today: A public meeting will be held tonight at 6:30 at the Nile-Cliffdell Fire Department, 13670 State Route 410, <br />
Naches. A Red Flag Warning remains in effect from noon today to 9 p.m. PDT for wind and low relative humidity <br />
for the Wenatchee Valley and Northern Columbia Basin, and a forecasted shift in winds over the next couple of <br />
days is expected to move the fire direction north/northeast/east toward the Highway 410 corridor. Breezy <br />
conditions with gusts up to 20 mph are forecasted. Residents can expect to see an increased presence of fire <br />
personnel in and around properties and homes both there and along the Bumping River Road, planning and <br />
preparing for structure protection on private property and mapping areas suitable for containment line <br />
construction. This is an essential step in preparing to defend the area from possible future fire spread. Firefighter <br />
and public safety remains the number one priority of the incident, and incident managers, cooperators and local <br />
partners do not take decisions lightly.<br />
 <br />
Evacuations: Bumping River Road and drainage remains at a LEVEL 3 evacuation. This means if you live in the <br />
area that you need to evacuate now. Hwy 410 from Eagle Rock north and west to Bumping River Road is <br />
currently in a LEVEL 2 Evacuation. This means if you live in the area you need to BE SET. Please check with <br />
Yakima County Office of Emergency Management on their official Facebook page <br />
https://www.facebook.com/YakimaCountyOEM for updates on evacuation information. Residents and visitors are <br />
encouraged to sign up for geo-specific emergency alerts through Yakima County: <br />
https://www.yakimacounty.us/2222/Alert-Yakima<br />
 <br />
Closures: An extension to the current temporary Forest closure order for National Forest lands is pending, and <br />
will cover the northwest portion of the William O. Douglas Wilderness Area to Hwy 410, and north of Hwy 410 in <br />

Attached is the morning update for Saturday, Aug. 14, 2021 from the Skyline Ridge Complex.<br />
Firefighters Succeed in Fully Lining Poole Creek Fire<br />
<br />
CANYONVILLE, Ore.— Yesterday, fire crews completed control lines all around the perimeter of the Poole Creek <br />
Fire. Last night, crews secured the control lines by burning a buffer of black against the advancing natural fire. <br />
Firefighters reported no hot spots or fires beyond the control lines resulting from the strategic firing operations. <br />
<br />
Today, firefighters will work to keep the fire within the control lines and deepen mop up toward the fire’s interior. <br />
Holding crews will be stationed along the fire control lines to put out any fires beyond the lines. Other crews will <br />
be mopping up—mop up is a methodical process of putting the fire completely out. All 19 fires in the Complex are <br />
now fully lined and 16 are 100% contained.<br />
<br />
Incident Commander Joe Hessel said, “This is quite an accomplishment in just two weeks’ time. Now, we shift <br />
from chasing and catching these fires to mopping up so they will be fully secured for the local fire district when <br />
we leave.”<br />
<br />
With the success of control efforts on the Poole Creek Fire, structural firefighters with the Oregon Office of the <br />
State Fire Marshal are expected to return to their home units on Sunday.  <br />
<br />
Fire teams managing the Skyline Ridge and Devil’s Knob complexes will host a joint in-person community <br />
meeting tonight at 7:30 p.m. at the Tiller Fire Station. The event will be an opportunity for community members to <br />
hear the most recent status on both complexes. The meeting will be outdoors with social distancing protocols in <br />
place. <br />

<br />
Firefighters are working around the clock to suppress the fires. As with all wildfires, the Incident Management <br />
Team is using a range of firefighting tactics to suppress the fire. Crews are conducting structure assessments, so <br />
fire personnel know where structures are located and are removing vegetation and debris to decrease the fuel <br />
load. This is an important tactic to provide structure protection. <br />
Walker Creek Fire: Structure protection continued through the night as firefighters removed vegetation and any <br />
materials that could threaten structures.  In the northern area of the fire, dozers are constructing fire line to <br />
remove fuel. Work today will include constructing fireline from the fires end down to Bonaparte Lake, continued <br />
construction and improvement of containment and contingency lines, and scouting for spot fires. <br />
Spur Fire: The fire pushed outside the northern containment line and was suppressed by crews and equipment.  <br />
Spot fires outside containment lines were also detected and suppressed utilizing engines, dozers, and hand <br />
crews. Smoke hampered aerial resources; but they remain available when conditions improve. Today’s activities <br />
will focus preparing Road 33, structure protection and suppressing new spot fires.<br />
Chickadee Creek Fire: Fire Personnel continue to work on increasing containment of the fire with the help of <br />
engine crews, working to enforce the line, and putting out any spot fires or hotspots along the line. Personnel will <br />
continue to look for hot spots and assist where needed. <br />
A CLOSURE ORDER has been put in place by the Colville National Forest: Spur Mountain Fire Closure Order <br />

Inchelium, WA – The Summit Trail Fire, started by lightning on July 12 and is burning on the Colville Reservation <br />
approximately 17 miles west of Inchelium. The Upper Lime Creek Fire, started by lightning on August 4, is also <br />
burning on the Colville Reservation approximately 6 miles north of Keller, Washington. Both fires<br />
are being managed by Northwest Incident Management Team 10, with 460 personnel engaged in fighting the <br />
fires.<br />
<br />
Fires in Washington state and British Columbia are producing heavy smoke across the region, leading to poor air <br />
quality in the areas around the Summit Trail and Upper Lime Creek Fires. Conditions remain very hot and dry, <br />
though yesterday’s air temperatures were slightly lower than forecast. Decreased visibility prevented aircraft from <br />
operating, but crews on the ground continued to make progress on containing the fires. The current excessive <br />
heat warning expires at 8:00 p.m. tonight.<br />
<br />
Significant gains were made on the Upper Lime Creek Fire where containment on the 376 acre fire is now at 60 <br />
percent. The Upper Lime Creek Fire is the largest and the last to be contained among the multiple small fires <br />
sparked by thunderstorms that passed through the area on August 4. Hand crews and heavy equipment continue <br />
to build, connect and reinforce fire lines around the perimeter of the Summit Trail Fire. Firefighters are also <br />
working during the night hours to hold and control the day’s gains. When weather conditions are more favorable, <br />
fire managers will conduct burning operations reducing unburned fuels and debris to further strengthen existing <br />
containment lines.<br />
<br />
Summit Trail Evacuations: Level 1 (Advisory) evacuations are in place from Lafleur south on Hall Creek Rd. to <br />
Hall Creek Flat (including Lynx Creek Rd.), Seyler Valley Rd. south to Bridge Creek Rd., and along Bridge Creek <br />
Rd. (including Mollenberg Lane) to Twin Lakes. The Twin Lakes area is under a Level 1 evacuation as well.<br />
Upper Lime Creek Evacuations: Level 1 evacuations are in place for the Pines (Cache Creek Road) south to <br />
Bridge Creek Rd.<br />
<br />
Road Closures: Sitdown Creek Rd. is closed at County Highway 99. Some recreation and parking areas may be <br />
closed to public access. Expect delays and please use caution when driving through the fire areas as firefighters <br />
may be working along the roadways.<br />
<br />
Closures: The Reservation remains closed to industrial activities and the general public. The Tribes have an <br />
Industrial Fire Precaution Level IV (General Shutdown), which closes all forest roads to the public. State and <br />
county improved roads (with a paved or gravel surface) remain open.</span>

<br />
Firefighters are working around the clock to suppress the fires. As with all wildfires, the Incident Management <br />
Team is using a range of firefighting tactics to suppress the fire. Crews are conducting structure assessments, so <br />
fire personnel know where structures are located and are removing vegetation and debris to decrease the fuel <br />
load. This is an important tactic to provide structure protection. <br />
<br />
Walker Creek Fire: Structure protection continued through the night as firefighters removed vegetation and any <br />
materials that could threaten structures.  In the northern area of the fire, dozers are constructing fire line to <br />
remove fuel. Work today will include constructing fireline from the fires end down to Bonaparte Lake, continued <br />
construction and improvement of containment and contingency lines, and scouting for spot fires. <br />
<br />
Spur Fire: The fire pushed outside the northern containment line and was suppressed by crews and equipment.  <br />
Spot fires outside containment lines were also detected and suppressed utilizing engines, dozers, and hand <br />
crews. Smoke hampered aerial resources; but they remain available when conditions improve. Today’s activities <br />
will focus preparing Road 33, structure protection and suppressing new spot fires.<br />
<br />
Chickadee Creek Fire: Fire Personnel continue to work on increasing containment of the fire with the help of <br />
engine crews, working to enforce the line, and putting out any spot fires or hotspots along the line. Personnel will <br />
continue to look for hot spots and assist where needed. <br />
<br />

(Klamath Falls, OR) – A Type 3 incident management organization will assume command of Bootleg Fire from <br />
the Pacific Northwest Incident Management Team 2 on Saturday, August 14 at 6:00 a.m. In total, eight Incident <br />
Management Teams were assigned to manage the Bootleg Fire since it began on July 6.<br />
<br />
On Thursday afternoon, firefighters and helicopters from the Bootleg Fire provided assistance with two new fires <br />
in the area. The Patton Meadow is approximately 2,000 acres on the Fremont-Winema-Forest west of Lakeview <br />
and the Willow Valley fire is on the Bureau of Land Management’s Lakeview District south of Bonanza at <br />
approximately 220 acres. Both the Patton Meadow and Willow Valley fires have numerous air and ground <br />
wildland firefighting resources engaging, with more firefighting resources ordered. For more information about <br />
the Patton Meadow Fire, visit https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/7798/.<br />
<br />
As the Type 3 incident management organization continues to manage the Bootleg Fire, five fire engines and <br />
additional personnel will remain to patrol the fire area and assist with any new fires in the area. The Oregon <br />
Department of Forestry will assume management of the Yainax and Walrus Fires effective Saturday, August 14 at <br />
6:00 a.m.<br />
<br />
“It has been an honor to work with the local, regional, and national cooperators on this incident,” said Incident <br />
Commander Rob Allen. “We are grateful for the support we’ve received from the local community. Every bit of it <br />
helped our firefighters contain this large fire under challenging circumstances.”<br />

 <br />
The Whitmore Fire is located on the Colville Reservation south of Omak Lake and west of Nespelem, WA. The <br />
Incident Command Post at Nespelem Community Center is closed to all but essential personnel to help ensure <br />
the health and safety of community members and firefighters.<br />
<br />
Smoke from fires in northern Washington and British Columbia continues to blanket the area. This has the effect <br />
of dampening fire activity. Today, there is a “Fire Weather Watch” due to Sunday afternoon’s forecast of gusty <br />
winds ahead of a cold front and low relative humidity. A Fire Weather Watch goes into effect when there is <br />
potential for a Red Flag Warning, which marks hot, dry, and windy conditions that are ideal for extreme fire <br />
behavior. These upcoming winds will further test the fire’s containment lines, but the fire is not anticipated to grow <br />
beyond its current footprint. Containment lines remain secure and firefighters will remain vigilant given the <br />
potential for a Red Flag Warning tomorrow.<br />
<br />
SIZE:  58,087 acres<br />
CONTAINMENT: 40%<br />
PERSONNEL: 396<br />
CAUSE: Lightning<br />
RESOURCES:<br />
Hand Crews: 8<br />
Engines: 25<br />
Dozers: 8<br />
Water Tenders: 15<br />
Helicopters: 1<br />
Fixed Wing: 1<br />
<br />
Operations<br />
Yesterday, firefighters patrolled the entire perimeter of the fire and continued “mopping up:” digging up and <br />
extinguishing residual burning materials close to containment lines in order to secure them. Crews completed <br />
mop-up around the ridgetop by Jim Creek Road and that area is now in patrol status.<br />
<br />
The UAS (Unmanned Aerial System) unit also ran an infrared detection flight from Omak Lake, around Camp <br />
Progress, and around the Dan Nason Basin areas. Very little heat was detected in that area of the fire and no <br />
heat appeared close to containment lines. In the southern part of the fire, sawyers felled fire-weakened trees <br />
along Whitmore Mountain Cutoff Road, creating access up to Whitmore lookout.<br />
<br />
Evacuations<br />
Level 2 evacuations remain in place through the Red Flag Warning period for the Columbia River Road corridor, <br />
Kartar Valley, Colville Agency, the community of Nespelem, and the SR155 corridor from Colville Agency north up <br />
to the Mission. Call Tribal Police at (509) 634-2472 with all evacuation questions.<br />
<br />
Traffic and Road Closures<br />
Coyote Creek Road remains closed. There will be increased traffic due to the Omak Stampede this weekend. <br />
Please use extra caution driving, as fire equipment accesses the northern portion of the fire from SR155 and will <br />
be entering and exiting side roads.</span>

(Klamath Falls, OR) – A Type 3 incident management organization will assume command of Bootleg Fire from <br />
the Pacific Northwest Incident Management Team 2 on Saturday, August 14 at 6:00 a.m. In total, eight Incident <br />
Management Teams were assigned to manage the Bootleg Fire since it began on July 6.<br />
<br />
On Thursday afternoon, firefighters and helicopters from the Bootleg Fire provided assistance with two new fires <br />
in the area. The Patton Meadow is approximately 2,000 acres on the Fremont-Winema-Forest west of Lakeview <br />
and the Willow Valley fire is on the Bureau of Land Management’s Lakeview District south of Bonanza at <br />
approximately 220 acres. Both the Patton Meadow and Willow Valley fires have numerous air and ground <br />
wildland firefighting resources engaging, with more firefighting resources ordered. For more information about <br />
the Patton Meadow Fire, visit https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/7798/.<br />
<br />
As the Type 3 incident management organization continues to manage the Bootleg Fire, five fire engines and <br />
additional personnel will remain to patrol the fire area and assist with any new fires in the area. The Oregon <br />
Department of Forestry will assume management of the Yainax and Walrus Fires effective Saturday, August 14 at <br />
6:00 a.m.<br />
<br />
“It has been an honor to work with the local, regional, and national cooperators on this incident,” said Incident <br />
Commander Rob Allen. “We are grateful for the support we’ve received from the local community. Every bit of it <br />
helped our firefighters contain this large fire under challenging circumstances.”<br />
<br />
