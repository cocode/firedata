Summary: The Boulder Mountain Fire was detected on Wednesday August 31st, 2022, at approximately 8:30 pm. The fire is located in <br />
the Tacoma Creek and Boulder Mountain area, 9 miles Northwest of Cusick, Washington. A mix of State, Federal and Private land is <br />
impacted. The terrain is difficult, and the fire is burning in heavy timber, slash, and beetle infested trees. Cause of the fire remains under <br />
investigation. <br />
<br />
Weather: Expect a “lazy smoke” day today with the continued stale inversion and temperatures similar to yesterday. Poor air quality will <br />
continue before improving in the beginning of the work week. Monday will bring a drop to more seasonal temperatures and increase <br />
relative humidity. Winds are expected to shift again today and are expected to be from the west to southwest. <br />
<br />
Actions: Saturday’s weather allowed the firefighters to conduct a successful small scale burning operation. These firing operations are a <br />
process where crews intentionally ignite fuels in specific areas to make the fire more manageable and safer as firefighter efforts move <br />
from line construction to mop up. Dozer and hand line work continues around the area of fire spread from Thursday’s wind event. <br />
Several edges of the fire are carrying heat, but a lot of progress has occurred in tamping these areas down. Hose lays are in place and <br />
crews are utilizing these hose lays to target hot spots, cooling the edge allowing further mop up of the interior. <br />
<br />
Today expect moderate fire activity as the fire continues to consume the patches of unburned fuel inside the perimeter. The south and <br />
southwest winds direction will push the fire back onto itself, helping with interior consumption. With hand and dozer line in place around <br />
the majority of the fire, the winds shouldn’t result in dramatic growth.  Progress is evident from the crew’s efforts with hose lay and mop <br />
up and we anticipate an increase in further containment this evening.  <br />
<br />
Important Information:  As we reflect on the tragedy from the events of 9/11 take a moment to thank the first responders. We too, want <br />
to thank all the communities and the local residents for the support and assistance they provide as responders work in their <br />
neighborhoods to keep them safe. The goal each day continues to be, everyone returning home safely.</span>

Current Situation: A Level 3 evacuation remains in place for the greater Oakridge, Westfir, and High Prairie area. There have been no <br />
changes in evacuation levels or areas in the last day. The fire grew significantly due to the weekend’s weather event (over 32,000 <br />
acres), primarily to the west, driven by strong easterly winds and dry fuels. Because the fire breached existing lines, the fire’s <br />
containment has been dropped to 0%.<br />
<br />
Currently 2,230 homes and 443 commercial structures remain under threat from the Cedar Creek Fire. The Office of the Oregon State <br />
Fire Marshal has committed seven taskforces and an incident management team to protect homes, businesses, and critical <br />
infrastructure in the area. Due to strong east winds and triple digit temperatures that work has primarily focused on the west side of the <br />
fire. As conditions change and winds shift, firefighters with the Oregon State Fire Marshal’s office will continue to evaluate threats to <br />
lives and properties. Fire crews will continue working day and night shifts to access structures and patrol critical areas where the fire is <br />
encroaching.<br />
<br />
Status: Yesterday evening, as winds started moving toward the east, firefighters on the western flank completed strategic burning <br />
operations near Eagle Butte, 5 miles northeast of Oakridge. The fire remained north of Highway 58, south of Forest Road 19, and east <br />
of Eagle Butte. Today, resources will maintain a heavy presence on the Highway 58 and Forest Road 19 corridors as they continue <br />
direct attack on the fire. Crews on the western flanks will mop up and secure burnout operations.<br />
<br />
In the east zone, direct checking actions continued on the southeast edge of the fire in the Waldo Lake area. Efforts are focused on <br />
creating fire breaks along existing roads and other barriers and burn-out operations to reduce fuels. Heavy equipment is arriving on site <br />
for use near Cultus Lake and Little Cultus Lake, and along the Cascade Lakes Highway and forest roads. The Cascade Lakes Highway <br />
remains closed to protect the public and firefighters as crews remove brush. Crews are preparing Forest Road 4290 between Charlton <br />
Lakes and the Cascade Lakes Highway to control the spread of the fire to the southeast. Brushing along the Cascade Lakes Highway <br />
continues to create fuel breaks 100-200 feet in depth on both sides of the road. Crews are working in the Brown Mountain area to <br />
reinforce a barrier east of the highway between Crane Prairie and Wickiup reservoirs. These fire breaks are high priority and will likely <br />
take most of a week to complete. In addition, crews are prepping infrastructure around Lava Lake Resort and evaluating values around <br />
Odell Lake.<br />
<br />
Weather/Fire Behavior: The extreme weather from the last two days has eased. Winds are shifting to northwesterly direction and have <br />
calmed. It is still very dry, but temperatures are starting to cool, and the heavy smoke layer has the effect of shading and moderating fire <br />
activity. Spotting and torching are still anticipated, and fire will continue to advance through lichens and heavy fuels.<br />
<br />
Closures: The Deschutes National Forest and Willamette National Forest have implemented closures for the Cedar Creek Fire. Please <br />
visit Willamette National Forest and Deschutes National Forest for detailed closure orders and a joint map. A Temporary Flight <br />
Restriction (TFR) is in place. The use of drones is prohibited in the fire area, please make it safe for our firefighters to use aircraft on the <br />
fire. Pacific Crest Trail hikers should visit pcta.org for current information.<br />
<br />
Restrictions: Fire restrictions are in place on the Willamette National Forest and Deschutes National Forest.</span>

Sedro Woolley, WA – Weather conditions along with dry fuels continue to increase fire activity on the lightning-caused Chilliwack <br />
Complex. Increased easterly winds, high temperatures, and low humidity throughout the area have prompted a Red Flag Warning from <br />
the National Weather Service through Sunday evening. On Friday, the Copper Lake and Copper Ridge fires merged, and the North <br />
Fork and Little Chill fires merged. The two fires are now known as Copper Lake and Little Chill fires, respectively. The Silesia Fire had <br />
significant growth and is approximately one mile from the forest boundary with the Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest. This fire <br />
activity has prompted the closure of the Silesia Creek Trail. The Chilliwack Complex is made up of several active fires (Little Chill, <br />
Copper Lake, Brush Creek, Silesia, and Little Beaver Creek).<br />
<br />
 Crews continue protection measures on a pack bridge and suspension bridge near the Brush Creek Fire and on the cable car <br />
potentially threatened by the Copper Lake Fire. Firefighters continue to utilize helicopter bucket work on the Little Beaver Creek Fire.<br />
<br />
<br />
The Washington Department of Ecology announced an Air Quality Alert due to current wildfire smoke from the fires in the North <br />
Cascades. North and northeasterly winds are moving into the area, pushing regional smoke impacts from fires into the greater <br />
Bellingham-Seattle metropolitan area. Increasing smoke impacts, reduced visibility and short periods of UNHEALTHY air quality are <br />
expected into Sunday. As southwest winds return late Sunday, smoke impacts will shift back into the Wenatchee, Chelan, and <br />
Okanogan valleys. Take precautions when recreating outdoors when heavy smoke is present. Learn more at Real-Time Air Quality Map <br />
| PurpleAir, airnow.gov or visit https://wasmoke.blogspot.com/.  <br />
  <br />
Trail and camp closures remain in effect due to fire activity. Closure information can be found at <br />

The High Desert Type 3 Incident Management Team took command of the Crockets Knob Fire today.  <br />
<br />
Weather: Today will be slightly warmer with calm terrain driven winds. Temperatures will reach the low-80s and relative humidity will drop into the upper teens. Moisture will steadily increase today with expected cloud <br />
cover by this evening.   <br />
<br />
Operations: Yesterday crews continued pulling hoses and excess equipment from containment lines. Much of the chipping and cleanup was completed along FSR 45 yesterday, and some work will continue today <br />
along other containment lines. Crews are checking containment lines for any remnant heat and mopping up using hand tools. Crews continue with suppression repairs along FSR 45 and other containment lines. <br />
Helicopters are available to assist firefighters if needed. <br />
<br />
Closures and Evacuations:  Grant County has lifted the Level One evacuation advisory in the area of the fire, and County Road 20 (Middle Fork Road) has been fully reopened.  <br />
<br />
Today the National Forests’ closure area will decrease in size. The Forest areas west of FSR 45 will once again be open to the public. For complete closure information, please go to:  <br />
https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/malheur/notices/?cid=STELPRD3845529   <br />
<br />
Smoke may be visible to nearby communities and Forest visitors. Smoke and air quality impacts within the state can be monitored by visiting: http://oregonsmoke.blogspot.com <br />
<br />
The Malheur National Forest’s Public Use Restriction is Phase C on the Blue Mountain and Prairie City Ranger Districts. No campfires or personal chainsaw use is allowed. The Umatilla National Forest remains in at <br />
Phase B, which allows campfires only in designated campgrounds and recreation sites. For more information, please go to: https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/malheur/fire, and  <br />
<br />
https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/umatilla/alerts-notices. <br />
<br />
Fire Danger remains High for the surrounding area. The vegetation is still very dry, and one spark or ember could start a significant fire. The public can help us by making good decisions when they recreate on public <br />
lands and by following local fire restrictions.</span>

Highlights: The Double Creek Fire spotted across the Imnaha River yesterday afternoon near Imnaha Grange and is approximately 500 acres. Six additional large air <br />
tankers were called in to join suppression efforts aided by the support of Blue Mountain Interagency Dispatch Center. The air tankers worked with resources from the <br />
Double Creek Fire, Nebo Fire, Oregon State Fire Marshal (OSFM), local resources and tactical firefighting aircraft air attack on the spot fire. Crews from Double Creek and <br />
Nebo Fires remained on the fire into the morning, continuing suppression efforts.  <br />
<br />
Double Creek Fire: <br />
The lightning caused Double Creek Fire is a full suppression fire, and the protection of lives and property remain the primary objectives of this incident. The spot fire near <br />
Imnaha Grange is part of the Double Creek Fire acreage growth. The River Group on the eastern side of the fire, along the Snake River, made good progress on structure <br />
protection along the fire side of the river and are near completion of those efforts. In the north, crews continue working on the east-west containment line and are exploring <br />
opportunities to further strengthen control features.  <br />
<br />
Eagle Cap Wilderness Fires  <br />
<br />
There are three lightning caused fires within the Eagle Cap Wilderness. The Nebo, Sturgill, and Goat Mountain 2 Fires are active and being managed to protect public and <br />
private infrastructure, while playing a natural role within designated Wilderness.  <br />
<br />
Nebo Fire: 12,182 <br />
Great progress was made on the Nebo Fire yesterday and existing fire lines were secured. There was some fire activity on the north of the fire along Wing Ridge, but it <br />
does not threaten any values at this time. Most of the resources on Nebo Fire responded to the spot fire on Double Creek. They helped provide critical assistance with <br />
heavy equipment and were able to push the spot fire away from nearby structures. Crew remains assigned to the Nebo Fire to reinforce and monitor the line as needed.  <br />
<br />
Sturgill Fire: 19,487 acres <br />
Fire activity was moderate on the Sturgill Fire yesterday with minimal growth. A rappel crew was inserted into the Bear Creek Guard Station to complete structure <br />
protection. Firefighters and heavy equipment in the Lostine corridor will continue work a shaded fuel break northwest of the fire.  <br />
<br />
Goat Mountain 2 Fire: 514 acres <br />
Helicopters dropped additional buckets on the Goat Mountain 2 Fire yesterday to continue cooling hotspots detected on the northeast perimeter. The fire continues backing <br />
and creeping in McCubbin Creek drainage.  <br />
<br />
Evacuations: <br />
<br />
Level 3 “Go Now” is in effect for Fence Creek north to Dug Bar and Freezeout south to the 39 Road. Level 2 “Get Set” is in effect for lands west of Imnaha River to Bear <br />
Gulch Road, south of Highway 350 to intersection of power lines and Harl Butte Road; Upper and Lower Imnaha Road from Fence Creek to Freezeout; and for Lostine <br />

Overview: Located 1.5 miles NE of Packwood, WA in the Goat Rocks Wilderness on the Cowlitz Valley Ranger District. The Goat Rocks <br />
Fire is estimated to be 2228 acres in size. The incident was discovered on Aug. 9, 2022 and was partly suppressed by a rappel attack <br />
crew. Crews suppressed what they safely could, and the fire was monitored. On September 9, 2022 the fire began to increase in size <br />
during a high wind event. <br />
<br />
Size: Approximately 2842 acres <br />
<br />
Forest closures: US Hwy-12 is closed from Skate Creek and White Pass. Highway 123 is closed from US Hwy 12 to Ohanapecosh <br />
Visitor center in Mount Rainier National Park. Forest Rd. Additionally, 4600, 4610, 4612 and all connected spurs, and Trail #65 to Bluff <br />
Lake.<br />
<br />
Evacuations: Currently Timberline, Goat Rocks, and High Valley neighborhoods east of Packwood are under a level 3 evacuation, or <br />
Go status, and are required to evacuate. The remainder of the neighborhoods and businesses in Packwood is currently under a level 2 <br />
evacuation, or Set status, and should be prepared to evacuate. Evacuees should head to the White Pass School, located at 516 <br />
Silverbrook Road in Randle. Small animals are welcome at the school in a kennel or cage.<br />
<br />
Cause: Lightning<br />
<br />
Fire Operations: Yesterday the fire grew to 2842 acres but most of the growth was to the north and south. The fire has moved about a <br />
half mile closer to Timberline, but the fire is still 1.5 miles away from those structures. The fire has backed down from the mountain <br />
slowly and remained on USFS property. Fire was observed at the 4610 road where a fuel break was created earlier last week. <br />
Resources patrolled the evacuated neighborhoods, but had an uneventful night<br />
<br />
This morning crews will be back out on the line continuing to protect the structures in Timberline, Goat Rocks, and High valley. With <br />
weather forecast to moderate today, resources will continue to construct new and improve existing fire breaks. As these breaks are <br />
constructed, a box is being built around this fire to eventually contain this incident. Depending on the visibility due to smoke, aircraft will <br />
be utilized to help keep the perimeter of the fire in a smaller footprint. Additionally, the Northwest Incident Management Team 10 will <br />
begin managing this incident starting Monday, September 12, 2022.<br />
<br />
Weather: There is a red flag warning that remains in effect through 7pm today, September 11. Continued high temperatures and low <br />
humidity will persist and continue these critical fire conditions through today. This evening a stronger onshore flow will bringing in some <br />
higher humidity, lower temperatures, and a slight chance of some rain. Smoke will continue to linger in the area and with that air quality <br />
will be lower, especially in the morning and evenings as nighttime inversions settle in to place.<br />
<br />
Fire Restrictions: Campfire bans, and other use restrictions are in place across the Gifford Pinchot National Forest and much of the <br />
region.<br />

September 10, 2022<br />
<br />
Plain, WA – Lightning started the White River and Irving Peak Fires on August 11. The fires are burning on the <br />
Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest, northwest of Plain, WA.<br />
<br />
Suppression Strategy – Fire managers continue to implement a long-term strategy to manage these fires, including the <br />
use of primary and contingency perimeter lines for containment. Tactics include completion and reinforcement of fire <br />
lines using roads and constructed hand line.<br />
<br />
Current Situation – Fire behavior on Friday was similar to what has been occurring for the last few days, but winds out <br />
of the east/northeast late Friday had the fire pushing back into areas already burned. Today, fire behavior will continue <br />
to be active as breezy winds occur. Fire behavior is expected to diminish on Sunday as cooler temperatures, higher <br />
relative humidity, as winds shift from a west/northwesterly direction. There is an increased chance of precipitation next <br />
week. As temperatures cool over the next few weeks, smoke may be visible as interior fuels continue to smolder and <br />
burn out.<br />
<br />
Today, crews will continue structure protection work on Windmill Lane southeast of the White River Fire and assess <br />
conditions to support aviation operations on the four fires the Type 3 team is now managing which include the White <br />
River, Irving Peak, Meander, and Minnow Ridge fires. Meander Fire is 6 acres and has minimal fire activity, mostly wispy <br />
smoke.<br />
<br />
The new 100+ acre Minnow Ridge Fire is burning in steep, inaccessible terrain near Chikamin Ridge 14 miles north of <br />
Plain, WA. The fire was very active late into the evening Friday. Fire resources will be doing preparation/protection work <br />
around structures in the Chiwawa River area. Plans are to utilize firelines from previous fires that have occurred in this <br />
area. Due to the proximity of this fire, a number of trails in the Chikamin Ridge area will be closed later today. The cause <br />
is undetermined.<br />
<br />
White River Fire –; Location: Sears Creek area of the White River drainage, approximately 14 miles NW of Plain, WA  <br />
The fire footprint remains within the control lines and geographic features being utilized as containment lines. <br />
Firefighters continue to establish an anchor point, monitor activity, and maintain structure protection along Sears Creek <br />
Road and Windmill Lane.<br />
<br />
Irving Peak Fire –  Location: Approximately 16 miles NW of Plain, WA<br />
<br />
The Irving Peak Fire saw some growth over the last few days. Firefighters continue work along roads and containment <br />
lines and monitor fire behavior and spread utilizing ground and aerial resources.<br />
Weather – A Red Flag Warning is in effect, Saturday, September 10, with potential for rapid fire spread in the east central Cascades; 5-<br />
15 mph winds, with gusts to 25 mph, <br />
out of the east are forecasted.  Minimum relative humidity in the teens to low 20s can be expected.<br />
<br />
Air Quality and Smoke – Current information about air quality and health recommendations during smoky conditions is available on the <br />
Washington Smoke Blog <br />
https://wasmoke.blogspot.com/<br />
<br />
Closures – An emergency closure issued by the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest remains in place and can be viewed here: <br />
www.fs.usda.gov/alerts/okawen/alerts-<br />
notices. Fire managers are asking people to please respect these closures while recreating in the area. The PCT remains open and not <br />
directly impacted by the fires, but <br />
the Little Wenatchee Ford and White River Trailheads cannot be used to access the PCT.<br />
<br />
Restrictions – Campfires are not allowed anywhere within the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest. Stage 2 Restrictions are now in <br />
effect for the entire forest, including campgrounds and wilderness areas: www.fs.usda.gov/detail/okawen/alerts-notices/?<br />

<br />
Grangeville, ID – The Jones Creek Fire is burning east of the Snake River on public lands administered by the Wallowa-Whitman <br />
National Forest, about seven miles north of Pittsburg Landing. The fuels in the area are composed of primarily grass, with timber <br />
stringers. It was reported early in the morning on September 4th, 2022. The cause is under investigation.<br />
<br />
Status: Firefighters have increased containment to 90%. The fire has not gained acreage in several days. Northwest Team 7 will <br />
transfer command of the incident back to the Wallowa-Whitman National Forest this evening at 8 p.m. This will be the last update <br />
issued by NW Team 7.<br />
<br />
Yesterday two crews and an engine continued structure protection around the High Range cabins on the north edge of the fire. On the <br />
eastern perimeter crews continued mop-up and cold trailing to secure the fire’s edge. Cold trailing means firefighters search for hidden <br />
heat and move along the fire’s edge leaving cold ground behind them. Firefighters assessed structure protection needs at Pittsburg <br />
Landing, and patrolled the Snake River at the eastern edge of the neighboring Double Creek Fire to watch for spots across the river. <br />
Firefighting equipment that is no longer needed was retrieved from the fire.<br />
<br />
Today: Dozers are staged at Pittsburg Landing if needed to reinforce fire lines. The fire has burned to the Snake River along the <br />
western edge. There is no immediate threat to river travel or boating facilities. River users are asked to remain aware of the status of <br />
both fires. Firefighters continue repairing dozer and hand lines where the fire’s edge is cold. Repair involves creating diversions to direct <br />
rain water off of fire lines to prevent erosion and restore natural drainage patterns. Firefighters and two engines will continue structure <br />
protection work near the High Range cabins. Retrieval of firefighting equipment will continue today.<br />
<br />
Weather: As a ridge of high pressure strengthens over the area, warm and dry conditions will continue through today and early next <br />
week, with very low relative humidity, temperatures into the low 90’s and light, variable winds from the south and southeast.<br />
<br />
Smoke: Along with the much larger Double Creek Fire burning west of the Snake River, this fire has periodically filled the Snake River <br />
Canyon with smoke. Today expect smoke to be trapped in the valleys as stable conditions develop.<br />
<br />
Closures/Restrictions: As of August 5th, 2022, the Wallowa-Whitman National Forest has entered fire restrictions that prohibit building, <br />
maintaining, attending or using a fire, campfire or stove fire except within designated campfire rings at a developed recreation site.<br />
<br />
Evacuations:  25 homes in the Getta Creek and Deer Creek areas remain in a Level 1 “Get Ready” status.<br />
<br />
With high temperatures and very low humidity, any ignitions can become dangerous fire very quickly. There is a lot of fire season ahead <br />
of us. Please do all you can to prevent new fires.</span>

						    <span class="textarea">Increased fire activity on some of the lightning caused fires, burning in the very remote, steep, and inaccessible terrain in the northwest <br />
corner of the Pasayten Wilderness Area, spurred trail and area closures over the holiday weekend. Hot, dry, and windy conditions are <br />
expected today as a trough moves into the area which is expected to create conditions for increased fire behavior. The Shull, The <br />
Parks, Kid, Three Fools, Skagit, and Elbow fires, located near the Canadian-U.S border, are expected to grow in acreage today.<br />
<br />
In a joint delegation with the National Park Service, a National Incident Management Organization Team, NIMO Team 2, assumed <br />
command yesterday over the six fires now being called the NW Pasayten Fires, located in the Pasayten Wilderness on the Methow <br />
Valley Ranger District of the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest, as well as the Chilliwack Complex Fires within the North Cascades <br />
National Park Service Complex.<br />
<br />
A number of closures are in effect including an area closure for the Freezeout Creek basin and a number of trails and portions of trails <br />
in the area. Portions of both the Pacific Crest Trail and Pacific Northwest Trail remain closed at this time.<br />
<br />
Smoke from these fires, and other fires burning in the region, may impact north central Washington communities over the next few <br />
days. Take precautions when recreating outdoors when heavy smoke is present. Learn more at Real-Time Air Quality Map | PurpleAir, <br />

<br />
Update on individual NW Pasayten Fires:<br />
•     The Kid Fire, located on the ridge between Rock Creek and West Fork Pasayten, is approximately 8 miles south of the Canadian-<br />
U.S. border. The fire has been very active with spotting and torching of grouped trees. Yesterday, smokejumpers worked on protection <br />
of the historic airport cabin, situated about one quarter mile away from the Kid Fire, utilizing pumps and sprinklers. If conditions allow, <br />
smokejumpers will also be burning out unburned brush between the fire and the cabin.<br />
•     The Parks Fire is also very active. It crossed the border into Canada a couple of days ago. There is a Canadian Incident <br />
Management Team assigned to the Canadian portion (called the Heather Fire north of the border) of the Parks Fire. The fire is about <br />
one half mile from the Monument 83 Fire Lookout at the time of this release. Firefighters have prepared the lookout by wrapping the <br />
base with fire protective wrap.<br />
•    The Skagit Fire, located in Freezeout Creek 6 miles south of the border, spread northward and crossed over the top of the ridge and <br />
down the other side.<br />
•     Three Fools Fire, located 8 miles south of the border, is actively backing down the ridge and through an old burn scar, it has spotted <br />
north of the ridge. <br />
•     The Elbow Fire, located 6 miles south of the border, is actively backing down the slope near Skagit Peak.<br />
•     Tuesday, fire activity increased on the Shull Fire located 11 miles south of the border.</span>

MERLIN, Ore. – The Rum Creek Fire has now been tested by several days of critically low relative humidity, high temperatures, and <br />
periods of gusty winds. Few flare-ups were reported and no spot fires were found outside the containment lines. Acreage has not <br />
changed for two days, and containment has increased to 69% despite the adverse weather.  <br />
<br />
Operations Section Chief Manny Mendoza summarized the Rum Creek Fire’s status as: “We are cautiously optimistic that things are <br />
going our way.” <br />
<br />
Last night, an air mass moved into the area bringing clouds, cooler temperatures and higher humidity. Tonight and tomorrow, remnants <br />
of Tropical Storm Kay will pass over the fire vicinity, possibly bringing showers. <br />
<br />
Any moisture will quickly infiltrate fine fuels like grasses and dead twigs, making them less likely to burn. These are the fuels which <br />
usually catch fire first and cause fires to spread and grow rapidly. Increased moisture in fine fuels is akin to using damp paper to start a <br />
campfire. Relative humidity usually drops during the day, but rises at night.   <br />
<br />
Larger fuels like stumps and logs take much longer to absorb moisture from the air and rain. In the interior of the fire, these larger fuels <br />
may continue to smolder or burn until they are extinguished by heavy winter rain and snow. Most of the fine fuels near them have <br />
burned or will have a higher moisture content, making fire spread unlikely. <br />
<br />
Near the fire’s edges, firefighters continue to search for and extinguish burning logs, stump holes, and other hot spots. They are also <br />
pulling out surplus equipment, no longer needed for fire suppression. The firefighters camped near the northwest edge of the fire will <br />
complete their mission today and return to the main camp near Merlin tonight. Firefighters will continue to monitor and suppress this <br />
part of the fire. <br />
<br />
As suppression work is completed on a section of the fire, resources will begin repair work to fix damage done by the firefighting efforts. <br />
A major part of repair is erosion control, mainly stabilizing exposed soils on fire lines by constructing waterbars.  <br />
<br />
Waterbars are a series of dips and mounds placed at an angle across the fire line. Runoff from rain and melting snow flows down the <br />
fire line until it is intercepted by a waterbar. Water is directed off of the erodible soil onto more stable ground. Some waterbars are <br />
constructed using heavy equipment such as dozers and excavators; others are dug by hand. This erosion control keeps soil on slopes <br />
and out of streams and rivers, where it can harm water quality and spawning habitat for salmon. <br />
<br />
Evacuations: Evacuation orders and notifications have not changed.  An interactive map showing evacuation levels according to <br />
address can be found at //JosephineCounty.gov/FireMap. For the most current evacuation information and resources, go to Josephine <br />
County Incident Information (rvem.org).  <br />
<br />
Road control: Josephine County Sheriff’s Office has established traffic access points around the fire zone. Road blocks are located at <br />
Galice Store; Bear Camp Road at Peavine (top intersection); Lower Grave Creek Road at Angora Creek (Grays Ranch); Quartz Creek <br />
Road about 3 miles up (end of County maintenance); Dutch Henry Road near Kelsey Creek (42 44'56.2/123 40'35.4); and Hog Creek at <br />
Galice Road. Only residents (must show proof of residency) and permitted users will be allowed through. <br />
<br />
River status: The Wild section of the Rogue River below Grave Creek will remain open unless fire conditions warrant closure. River <br />
status is determined on a day-to-day basis. Please call 541-471-6535 for more information regarding Rogue River permits. No new <br />
boating permits will be issued at this time.</span>

Klamath Falls, Ore. – Today, firefighting operations on the Van Meter Fire will transition fully into mop-up with the completion of <br />
hoselays into the southern portion of the fire.  Firefighters will use water to cool hot-spots and wet burning fuels.  This will increase the <br />
efficiency of mop-up and support firefighting activities to widen the black, cold area along the fire perimeter.<br />
<br />
The fire remains within the existing footprint and is 2,502 acres.<br />
<br />
Last night crews used hand-held infrared viewers to detect hot spots along the perimeter on the northeast side of the fire.  Firefighters <br />
will pay special attention through the day to these areas, cooling with water, exposing burning material, and ensuring the spots are cool <br />
to the touch.  Use of the hand-held infrared devices will continue tonight.<br />
<br />
Structural task forces from the Rogue Valley and Deschutes County returned to their home units Saturday.  The Klamath County <br />
Structural Task Force is available if needed for structural protection and wildland resources will continue to monitor, patrol, and mop-up <br />
within the residential areas.<br />
<br />
One minor accident occurred on the fireline Saturday during dayshift and falling snags and trees continue to be a primary safety <br />
concern for firefighters on the line.  Significant effort is focused on safely falling snags near the fire perimeter and in travel routes for <br />
firefighter safety.  <br />
<br />
Residential traffic is allowed in the fire area, but residents are encouraged to drive slowly and be aware of fire operation traffic as they <br />
travel through the fire.  Bureau of Land Management lands in and around the fire area remain closed to the public. <br />
<br />
Evacuation levels continue to be evaluated based on fire behavior.  For the latest up-to-date evacuation information, please visit the <br />
Klamath County Sheriff’s Office Facebook page at https://www.facebook.com/KlamathSheriff or call 541-205-9730.  The Red Cross <br />
Evacuation Shelter at the Klamath County Fair and Event Center has been closed.<br />
<br />
Temperatures today on the fire will be cooler with higher humidity and the potential for some precipitation tonight and possible showers <br />
and thunderstorms on Monday.  As the weather transitions from hot and dry to these cooler conditions there will be an increase in the <br />
wind.<br />
<br />
A Temporary Flight Restriction exists around the fire to limit any aircraft not associated with firefighting activities in the airspace.  <br />
Wildfires are always a no-fly zone for drones.  A drone flying in the area can ground all operational aircraft and impact suppression <br />
activities.</span>

						    <span class="textarea">White River and Irving Peak Fire Update<br />
September 10, 2022<br />
<br />
Plain, WA – Lightning started the White River and Irving Peak Fires on August 11. The fires are burning on the <br />
Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest, northwest of Plain, WA.<br />
<br />
Suppression Strategy – Fire managers continue to implement a long-term strategy to manage these fires, including the <br />
use of primary and contingency perimeter lines for containment. Tactics include completion and reinforcement of fire <br />
lines using roads and constructed hand line.<br />
<br />
Current Situation – Fire behavior on Friday was similar to what has been occurring for the last few days, but winds out <br />
of the east/northeast late Friday had the fire pushing back into areas already burned. Today, fire behavior will continue <br />
to be active as breezy winds occur. Fire behavior is expected to diminish on Sunday as cooler temperatures, higher <br />
relative humidity, as winds shift from a west/northwesterly direction. There is an increased chance of precipitation next <br />
week. As temperatures cool over the next few weeks, smoke may be visible as interior fuels continue to smolder and <br />
burn out.<br />
<br />
Today, crews will continue structure protection work on Windmill Lane southeast of the White River Fire and assess <br />
conditions to support aviation operations on the four fires the Type 3 team is now managing which include the White <br />
River, Irving Peak, Meander, and Minnow Ridge fires. Meander Fire is 6 acres and has minimal fire activity, mostly wispy <br />
smoke.<br />
<br />
The new 100+ acre Minnow Ridge Fire is burning in steep, inaccessible terrain near Chikamin Ridge 14 miles north of <br />
Plain, WA. The fire was very active late into the evening Friday. Fire resources will be doing preparation/protection work <br />
around structures in the Chiwawa River area. Plans are to utilize firelines from previous fires that have occurred in this <br />
area. Due to the proximity of this fire, a number of trails in the Chikamin Ridge area will be closed later today. The cause <br />
is undetermined.<br />
<br />
White River Fire –; Location: Sears Creek area of the White River drainage, approximately 14 miles NW of Plain, WA  <br />
The fire footprint remains within the control lines and geographic features being utilized as containment lines. <br />
Firefighters continue to establish an anchor point, monitor activity, and maintain structure protection along Sears Creek <br />
Road and Windmill Lane.<br />
<br />
Irving Peak Fire –  Location: Approximately 16 miles NW of Plain, WA<br />
<br />
The Irving Peak Fire saw some growth over the last few days. Firefighters continue work along roads and containment <br />
lines and monitor fire behavior and spread utilizing ground and aerial resources.<br />
Weather – A Red Flag Warning is in effect, Saturday, September 10, with potential for rapid fire spread in the east central Cascades; 5-<br />
15 mph winds, with gusts to 25 mph, <br />
out of the east are forecasted.  Minimum relative humidity in the teens to low 20s can be expected.<br />
<br />
Air Quality and Smoke – Current information about air quality and health recommendations during smoky conditions is available on the <br />
Washington Smoke Blog <br />
https://wasmoke.blogspot.com/<br />
<br />
Closures – An emergency closure issued by the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest remains in place and can be viewed here: <br />
www.fs.usda.gov/alerts/okawen/alerts-<br />
notices. Fire managers are asking people to please respect these closures while recreating in the area. The PCT remains open and not <br />
directly impacted by the fires, but <br />
the Little Wenatchee Ford and White River Trailheads cannot be used to access the PCT.<br />
<br />
Restrictions – Campfires are not allowed anywhere within the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest. Stage 2 Restrictions are now in <br />
effect for the entire forest, including <br />
campgrounds and wilderness areas: www.fs.usda.gov/detail/okawen/alerts-notices/?cid=fsbdev3_053600.</span>
