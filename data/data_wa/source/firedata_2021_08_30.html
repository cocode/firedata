<br />
Firefighters continue to strengthen and hold previously constructed containment lines as warmer weather <br />
conditions were present over the Bull Complex Fire yesterday. Focus areas are the southeast and northeast <br />
portions of the fire where the main fire is now up against containment lines.  The warmer temperatures led to <br />
increased fire activity and higher volumes of smoke. Similar smoke volumes as yesterday are likely to settle into <br />
the valleys overnight and persist through the morning today.  Fire behavior is expected to be higher again today <br />
but isn’t expected to pose a high risk to critical focus areas.  The Bull Complex grew approximately 470 acres <br />
Saturday. <br />
<br />
Weather conditions are forecasted to remain warmer and drier again today which is expected to produce similar <br />
volumes of smoke for the Detroit area. Smoke is likely to cause reduced air quality and visibility, especially in the <br />
early morning hours.<br />
<br />
Aircraft are being challenged with poor visibility until smoke lifts and disperses in the early afternoon hours.  <br />
Water bucket drops are ongoing as the warmer temperatures are creating slightly more fire activity. Helicopters <br />
will continue to support ground firefighters as needed and during the periods of adequate visibility.  Please use <br />
caution if traveling near the Davis Airstrip in Gates. Area traffic will increase as a result of this aviation support <br />
location.<br />
<br />
Moderated weather conditions, including reduced temperatures are expected to return to the area starting <br />
Monday and are forecasted to continue into the first part of next week, providing favorable conditions for meeting <br />
firefighting objectives.<br />
<br />
Closures:  For the safety of wildland firefighters and the public, the National Forests have enacted area closures <br />
that prevent the public from being upon National Forest System lands in the vicinity of the Bull Complex where <br />
uncontrolled fire and fire suppression activities are occurring. All Forest lands that are south and west of Forest <br />
Road 46, and east of the Riverside Fire perimeter are closed. The entire length of Forest Road 46 is closed. <br />
Lands within the 2020 Lionshead and Beachie Creek Fire areas are also closed.  See the closure orders and <br />
maps at https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/closures/7773/.<br />
<br />
Contractors approved by the Forest Service through a permit system are allowed through the closure order, as <br />
are vendors and others working on recovery efforts related to the 2020 area fires.  Breitenbush Hot Springs <br />
Resort is open; however, reservations are required to pass through a roadblock on Forest Road 46.<br />
<br />

<br />
Kettle Falls, WA – Yesterday, fire behavior on the southeast flank of the Bulldog Mountain fire showed active <br />
burning fuels exposed to sunlight. Firefighters patrolled and took actions to hold the remainder of the fire within <br />
containment lines.  <br />
<br />
Chipping of fuels and the removal of dangerous snags continue along the South Boulder road and in the Davis <br />
Lake area to prepare these roads in the event that the fire moves out of its current footprint. Tactical firing <br />
operations will occur on the northeast and potentially south of the Bulldog Mountain fire today. <br />
<br />
On the Mack Mountain fire, crews will continue to monitor and improve fire lines. Air resources will monitor both <br />
the Bulldog Mountain and Mack Mountain fires for active fire behavior. There will also be crews out working on <br />
patrolling the roads around the Bulldog Mountain and Mack Mountain fires.  <br />
<br />
Along with the warmer temperatures experienced yesterday, there was low relative humidity and higher <br />
southwest winds which prompted active fire behavior and elevated smoke. This weather is expected to persist for <br />
the next couple days.  <br />
<br />
Citizens should remain vigilant and are strongly encouraged to sign up for alerts at  Ferry County Alerts.  <br />
Motorists traveling on Boulder Hwy and SR395 should watch for heavy equipment and firefighters turning off and <br />
onto the roadway. Firefighter and public safety is our number one priority.  <br />
<br />
Smoke: Current weather conditions will moderate smoke impacts throughout the area today.  <br />
<br />
Closures: An area closure is in effect on Colville National Forest lands in the vicinity of the Bulldog Mountain Fire. <br />
For more information on area and road closures on the Colville National Forest, please visit: <br />
https://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fseprd938379.pdf <br />
<br />
Citizens are asked to stay clear of the fire area and comply with area closures.  <br />
<br />
While current weather conditions provide respite from the extreme fire potential present in northeast Washington, <br />
the forest can quickly dry out again in the many weeks of fire season ahead. Please continue to do all you can to <br />
prevent wildfires. <br />
<br />
The Colville National Forest is at IFPL level 3. Road closures remain in effect.  <br />
<br />
The Incident Command Post is located in Inchelium, WA. A spike camp will remain in place in Kettle Falls, WA to <br />
support the Bulldog Mountain and Mack Mountain Fires.</span>

Winthrop, WA – The Cedar Creek, Cub Creek 2, and Delancy fires are burning on the Okanogan-Wenatchee <br />
National Forest and public and private lands within Okanogan County.<br />
 <br />
Safety Note: The Cedar and Cub Creek Fires are active fires, and certain roads and trails in the community and <br />
Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest remain closed for your safety. The public is reminded to stay out of closed <br />
areas for your safety and the safety of firefighters.<br />
 <br />
Fire Information Line: (509) 557-0740 (8:00 am to 8:00 pm daily)<br />
 <br />
Cedar Creek Fire: The fire is 55,187 acres and 80% contained. High pressure settled over the region Saturday <br />
resulting in near-full sunshine and shading. The day was much drier than the previous two days with <br />
temperatures in the 80s. Winds were light and terrain driven. We saw minimal fire behavior Saturday and <br />
overnight. As mop up continues in the burned area, crews will be focused on removing any heat near structures <br />
utilizing an infrared camera to aid in this work. Hand lines that were put in to contain the fire near Early Winters <br />
Creek are being repaired, and excavators will work to repair dozer lines along other sections of the fire.<br />
 <br />
Cub Creek 2 Fire: The Cub Creek 2 Fire is 70,186 acres and 70% contained. Smoke seen on the southern edge <br />
of the fire was quickly mopped up by engines. Falling crews are working to remove hazard trees in the Nice <br />
Campground. In the area around the Brevicomis summer homes, an infrared camera will help fire personnel to <br />
find and remove any remaining heat. Mop up will also continue in the riparian corridor around Bud Creek, where <br />
crews are systematically searching for and removing pockets of heat. Resource advisors are flagging areas for <br />
suppression repair. Excavators will repair dozer lines along the western edge of the fire.<br />
 <br />
Delancy Fire: The Delancy Fire is being monitored by aerial surveillance and remains at 223 acres and 95% <br />
containment.</span>

The Chickadee Creek Fire is located approximately 15 miles west of Tonasket, Washington. The Walker <br />
Creek Fire is located approximately 13 miles east/northeast of Tonasket, Washington, surrounding Lake <br />
Bonaparte. The Incident Command Post at the Omak Stampede Grounds is closed to all but essential <br />
personnel to help ensure the health and safety of community members and firefighters. There will be a <br />
warming and drying trend over the weekend, with temperatures today ranging from 70 to 80 degrees.<br />
 <br />
Operations - Fire crews and equipment are being shifted around both fires internally as assignments are <br />
completed to allow the most efficient use of resources:<br />
 <br />
Chickadee Creek Fire<br />
Fire crews are continuing mop-up on the western fire perimeter. Firefighters completed additional dozer line <br />
on the northern fire edge yesterday and prepared areas for burnout operations to secure containment lines. <br />
Fire crews built direct dozer line up against the fire’s edge on the southern portion of the fire, working to keep <br />
the fire in the smallest possible footprint. Helicopter water bucket drops cooled hot spots on the eastern edge <br />
of the fire. A burnout operation is planned today above the road on the eastern fire edge, to remove pockets of <br />
unburned fuels and secure the fire line.<br />
 <br />
Walker Creek Fire<br />
Firefighters completed a section of indirect line along the northwestern fire perimeter. Fire crews are mopping <br />
up the northeastern fire edge and are building direct fire line along the eastern fire perimeter to minimize the <br />
fire size. Firefighters continued mop-up work along the southern fire perimeter and patrolled to locate and <br />
extinguish remaining heat sources near the fire line yesterday. Today, fire crews will continue to mop-up and <br />
patrol across the fire and will construct direct fire line in areas where it is feasible.<br />
 <br />
Evacuations<br />
Evacuation levels decreased on both fires today. For details, see the Okanogan County Emergency <br />

Winthrop, WA – The Cedar Creek, Cub Creek 2, and Delancy fires are burning on the Okanogan-Wenatchee <br />
National Forest and public and private lands within Okanogan County.<br />
 <br />
Safety Note: The Cedar and Cub Creek Fires are active fires, and certain roads and trails in the community and <br />
Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest remain closed for your safety. The public is reminded to stay out of closed <br />
areas for your safety and the safety of firefighters.<br />
 <br />
Fire Information Line: (509) 557-0740 (8:00 am to 8:00 pm daily)<br />
 <br />
Cedar Creek Fire: The fire is 55,187 acres and 80% contained. High pressure settled over the region Saturday <br />
resulting in near-full sunshine and shading. The day was much drier than the previous two days with <br />
temperatures in the 80s. Winds were light and terrain driven. We saw minimal fire behavior Saturday and <br />
overnight. As mop up continues in the burned area, crews will be focused on removing any heat near structures <br />
utilizing an infrared camera to aid in this work. Hand lines that were put in to contain the fire near Early Winters <br />
Creek are being repaired, and excavators will work to repair dozer lines along other sections of the fire.<br />
 <br />
Cub Creek 2 Fire: The Cub Creek 2 Fire is 70,186 acres and 70% contained. Smoke seen on the southern edge <br />
of the fire was quickly mopped up by engines. Falling crews are working to remove hazard trees in the Nice <br />
Campground. In the area around the Brevicomis summer homes, an infrared camera will help fire personnel to <br />
find and remove any remaining heat. Mop up will also continue in the riparian corridor around Bud Creek, where <br />
crews are systematically searching for and removing pockets of heat. Resource advisors are flagging areas for <br />
suppression repair. Excavators will repair dozer lines along the western edge of the fire.<br />
 <br />
Delancy Fire: The Delancy Fire is being monitored by aerial surveillance and remains at 223 acres and 95% <br />
containment.</span>

Winthrop, WA – The Cedar Creek, Cub Creek 2, and Delancy fires are burning on the Okanogan-Wenatchee <br />
National Forest and public and private lands within Okanogan County.<br />
 <br />
Safety Note: The Cedar and Cub Creek Fires are active fires, and certain roads and trails in the community and <br />
Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest remain closed for your safety. The public is reminded to stay out of closed <br />
areas for your safety and the safety of firefighters.<br />
 <br />
Fire Information Line: (509) 557-0740 (8:00 am to 8:00 pm daily)<br />
 <br />
Cedar Creek Fire: The fire is 55,187 acres and 80% contained. High pressure settled over the region Saturday <br />
resulting in near-full sunshine and shading. The day was much drier than the previous two days with <br />
temperatures in the 80s. Winds were light and terrain driven. We saw minimal fire behavior Saturday and <br />
overnight. As mop up continues in the burned area, crews will be focused on removing any heat near structures <br />
utilizing an infrared camera to aid in this work. Hand lines that were put in to contain the fire near Early Winters <br />
Creek are being repaired, and excavators will work to repair dozer lines along other sections of the fire.<br />
 <br />
Cub Creek 2 Fire: The Cub Creek 2 Fire is 70,186 acres and 70% contained. Smoke seen on the southern edge <br />
of the fire was quickly mopped up by engines. Falling crews are working to remove hazard trees in the Nice <br />
Campground. In the area around the Brevicomis summer homes, an infrared camera will help fire personnel to <br />
find and remove any remaining heat. Mop up will also continue in the riparian corridor around Bud Creek, where <br />
crews are systematically searching for and removing pockets of heat. Resource advisors are flagging areas for <br />
suppression repair. Excavators will repair dozer lines along the western edge of the fire.<br />
 <br />
Delancy Fire: The Delancy Fire is being monitored by aerial surveillance and remains at 223 acres and 95% <br />
containment.</span>

The Devil's Knob Complex is a group of lightning-caused fires on the Tiller Ranger District of the Umpqua <br />
National Forest and private lands protected by Douglas Forest Protective Association and the Cow Creek Band <br />
of the Umpqua Tribe of Indians.  <br />
<br />
Smith Fire (17,107 acres): Along the fire’s northwest perimeter, firefighters continue to improve holding lines and <br />
hold and mop up previous strategic firing operations. Along the south side, crews are preparing for additional <br />
burn operations and working to mop up and box in some areas of fire that crossed containment lines. In Ash <br />
Valley, a system of hose lays and sprinklers is in place for structure protection, while crews are using dozers and <br />
masticators to develop control lines to the north and east.  <br />
<br />
Big Hamlin Fire (13,795 acres): Along the southeastern edge, crews are taking a deliberate pace with strategic <br />
firing operations cleaning up previous burns and adding more depth to the fireline. Containment lines along the <br />
western perimeter are holding well. Firefighters are working to build and scout additional lines in the northeast as <br />
the fire continues to show relatively slow growth. <br />
<br />
Dismal Creek, Little Applegate, Mule Creek, Section 30 (Railroad) and Wild Cat fires (1,489 total acres): These <br />
fires are containedand remain in patrol status. <br />
<br />
Weather: Hot and dry conditions continue with temperatures climbing into the upper 80s, contributing to high <br />
potential for increased fire activity. However, smoke cover might moderate fire behavior. Winds are anticipated to <br />
be relatively light out of the northwest. <br />
<br />
Air Quality: Check latest conditions on the Oregon Smoke Information Blog: http://oregonsmoke.blogspot.com. <br />
<br />
Aviation Operations: Air resources are providing support where feasible and as weather allows, and a helibase <br />
has been established near Days Creek to better support firefighting efforts. For the safety of firefighters and <br />
aircraft fighting the Devil’s Knob Complex, a  temporary flight restriction remains in place over the fire area. <br />
Wildfires are also a “No Drone Zone.” <br />
<br />
Evacuations and Closures: Visit the Douglas County Sheriff Office’s interactive evacuation map at <br />
www.dcso.com/evacuations for the latest information. Residents can opt in to receive emergency alerts by <br />
registering at www.dcso.com/alerts. <br />
<br />
The Forest Service has an Emergency Fire Closure restricting public access to most of Steamboat, North <br />
Umpqua, and South Umpqua. To view the Closure, go to https://www.fs.usda.gov/alerts/umpqua/alerts-notices.</span>

our sincere appreciation to local agencies, cooperators, and the community for your support throughout the <br />
incident. Until there is a season-ending event such as wetting rain or snow, warm, sunny days will cause <br />
unburned islands of fuel to flame up and smoke may be visible. Please do not report these smoke plumes unless <br />
they are close to the fire line. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Overview: The Ford Corkscrew Fire showed moderate fire behavior yesterday, primarily through interior <br />
unburned islands on the east side of the fire. Observations of torching and spotting occurred in short duration <br />
and smoke was present. Similar conditions are anticipated for today. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Fire Update: Today will be the hottest and driest day of the short-term drying trend the region is currently <br />
experiencing. Moderate fire behavior is expected for the Ford Corkscrew Fire as interior islands of fuel continue <br />
to burn. Resources in all divisions will mop up and patrol the fire area to adequately secure control lines and <br />
protect interior values. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Evacuations are still in place for the Ford Corkscrew Fire. Please refer to the map on Inciweb at <br />
https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/7803/ or Stevens County Sheriff’s Office Facebook page. Please note, the <br />
reduction in acres is due to better data on containment line locations. As containment line and fire edge <br />
confirmations are received from field personnel, further adjustments in acreage are expected. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Weather: Today will be warm and dry with highs near 80 degrees and humidity dropping back into the 20 percent <br />
range. Winds will be mostly light and favor southwesterly. Monday, the next low pressure system approaches <br />
from the west, adding some cloud cover breezy southwest winds. Increased winds, along with slightly lower <br />
relative humidity, will slightly elevate fire weather concerns. A cold front will push in late in the day to trim <br />
Monday's high temperatures a few degrees, with cooler conditions Tuesday behind the front. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Closures/Restrictions: Some roads within the and near the fire perimeter remain closed and a temporary flight <br />
restriction (TFR) remains in effect around the fire area. Residents and visitors are also encouraged to maintain a <br />
safe distance from working aircraft conducting water filling operations on local water ways and lakes, including <br />
Loon and Long lakes.</span>

<br />
Lakeview, OR- This is the final update from the Fox Complex.<br />
<br />
The Patton Meadow Fire of the Fox Complex remained at 8,930 acres yesterday with containment growing to <br />
90%.<br />
<br />
Tomorrow a local Type 4 team assumes management of the fire at 8:00am. Today they will shadow ODF <br />
Team 3 as they prepare to take over. When they assume management, they will complete any remaining mop <br />
up, patrol the perimeter of the fire, bring back any remaining, unnecessary equipment, and continue <br />
suppression repair work.<br />
<br />
Crews will continue mop up operations on the north side of the fire, going 200-300 feet deep, extinguishing <br />
any hot spots they discover. In the morning briefing, Operations Section Chief Rob Pentzer told crews, “Do <br />
one more grid, one more look for hot spots so we can have this wrapped up.” By the end of the shift, the <br />
entire fire perimeter will have a rind at least 200 feet deep into the interior.<br />
<br />
Efforts on the east, south and west sides of the fire will continue with hauling equipment back to fire camp and <br />
repairing dozer and hand lines that were part of the firefighting effort. As the firefighting effort winds down, <br />
most crews will be demobilizing and heading home or onto other fire assignments. There will be some crews <br />
and equipment remaining to help the Type 4 team manage the fire going forward.<br />
<br />
As the work continues, and the season continues, the public may see smoke from the interior of the fire. This <br />
is normal and does not pose any threat to the public.<br />
<br />
The Fremont-Winema Forest, and fire area, remains closed due to fire danger. For the latest information on <br />
the forest closures, go to https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/fremont-winema/alerts-notices/?cid=stelprdb5317501.</span>

<br />
Current Situation: Green Ridge Fire: Activity on the Green Ridge Fire continued to be minimal yesterday due to <br />
higher relative humidity and cooler temperatures. Warmer and dryer weather is predicted today and fire behavior <br />
may increase accordingly. Firefighters will remain diligent in watching for new smoke.  More progress was made <br />
yesterday on direct containment of the fire in the southeast corner near Diamond Creek Road below Mount <br />
Misery.  The objective for this area of the fire is to establish containment line going south then turning the corner <br />
going west towards Diamond Peak. Crews patrolled and mopped up other sections of uncontrolled line along <br />
portions of the northeast corner, near Clear Water lookout tower and guard station, and southwest corner near <br />
Godman Trailhead along Skyline Drive. Predicted gusty winds again today could test secured line. Resource <br />
advisors are onsite to provide knowledge of cultural and natural resource areas to be protected. Advisors are <br />
also mapping all suppression line constructed for future repair. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Current Situation: Lick Creek Fire: The Lick Creek Fire remains 80,421 acres and is now 100% contained. <br />
Smoke will continue to be visible as unburned pockets of vegetation inside the fire perimeter are consumed. <br />
Crews will continue to mop-up any interior pockets of heat and patrol lines as they can safely.  <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Weather & Smoke Information: Mostly sunny today with smoke and haze.  A warming trend will continue today as <br />
temperatures may reach 72-77 degrees along the ridges and 81-86 degrees in the valley bottoms. Winds will be <br />
west-northwest 6-10 mph with gusts up to 18 mph in the afternoon. Relative humidity will range from 23-28% <br />
above 5000 feet and 17-22% in the valleys. Smoke information is available on Washington Smoke Blog at: <br />

<br />
Summary:  The Rough Patch Complex and Jack fire are being managed under a full suppression strategy using <br />
direct and indirect tactics to minimize fire spread to prevent loss of valuable resources. Leaders’ intent is to <br />
minimize any fire progression to the west and to protect private structures throughout the fire area. The Rough <br />
Patch consists of four fires: Chaos, Little Bend, Buckhead and Near Minky. Overall, there was minimum fire <br />
activity yesterday across the Rough Patch Complex and the Jack fire. Much of the fire growth was due to indirect <br />
burning operations conducted as a tactic to secure the fires’ perimeters in areas where direct suppression tactics <br />
poses a risk to firefighter safety.  <br />
<br />
  <br />
<br />
Chaos and Little Bend Fires:  The Chaos fire is at 16,539 acres and the Little Bend fire is at 6,717 acres. Fireline <br />
on the west side of the Chaos fire continues to hold. Today crews will be prepping the north end of Chaos fire to <br />
conduct additional burning operations as weather and fuel conditions allow. Structure protection needs are being <br />
evaluated north of the Chaos fire near the Bohemia Mine. Yesterday the southern edge of the Chaos fire was <br />
active along the 3821; crews were busy mopping up from previous days burning with support from aircraft doing <br />
water drops. Today, they will continue improving line south toward the Little Bend fire and prepping for burning <br />
operations with the goal of securing the southern end of the Chaos into the western end of the Little Bend fire in <br />
the coming days. <br />
<br />
  <br />
<br />
Jack and Buckhead Fires:  The Jack fire is at 23,884 acres and the Buckhead fire is at 3,286 acres. The west, <br />
north, and northeast end of the Jack fire has been contained and is being patrolled. Fire crews continue to <br />
improve fire line on the southwest section of the Jack fire where it meets the Buckhead fire. Today’s operations <br />
include improving line for future burning operations along the southwestern border when conditions are <br />
favorable. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Near Minky Fire:  The Near Minky fire is at 4,676 acres. This fire is located south of the Jack and Buckhead fires. <br />
The eastern edge and a portion of the western edge have been contained. The focus is now on the northwest <br />
corner and the southern end of the Near Minky fire. Northern Rockies Team 1 and Florida Red Team are working <br />
on a joint strategy for the Near Minky and Smith fires to limit western spread and share resources. <br />
<br />
  <br />
<br />
Weather:  Temperatures will be slightly cooler than yesterday with relative humidity in the mid-20’s. Northeast <br />
winds will switch to northwest in the afternoon, the same as yesterday. This weather has the potential to increase <br />
fire activity on both the Rough Patch Complex and the Jack fire. Expect dense smoke in the lower elevations <br />
until the afternoon when winds shift to the north.</span>

 <br />
Kettle Falls, WA – Yesterday, fire behavior on the southeast flank of the Bulldog Mountain fire showed active <br />
burning fuels exposed to sunlight. Firefighters patrolled and took actions to hold the remainder of the fire within <br />
containment lines.  <br />
<br />
Chipping of fuels and the removal of dangerous snags continue along the South Boulder road and in the Davis <br />
Lake area to prepare these roads in the event that the fire moves out of its current footprint. Tactical firing <br />
operations will occur on the northeast and potentially south of the Bulldog Mountain fire today. <br />
<br />
On the Mack Mountain fire, crews will continue to monitor and improve fire lines. Air resources will monitor both <br />
the Bulldog Mountain and Mack Mountain fires for active fire behavior. There will also be crews out working on <br />
patrolling the roads around the Bulldog Mountain and Mack Mountain fires.  <br />
<br />
Along with the warmer temperatures experienced yesterday, there was low relative humidity and higher <br />
southwest winds which prompted active fire behavior and elevated smoke. This weather is expected to persist for <br />
the next couple days.  <br />
<br />
Citizens should remain vigilant and are strongly encouraged to sign up for alerts at  Ferry County Alerts.  <br />
Motorists traveling on Boulder Hwy and SR395 should watch for heavy equipment and firefighters turning off and <br />
onto the roadway. Firefighter and public safety is our number one priority.  <br />
<br />
Smoke: Current weather conditions will moderate smoke impacts throughout the area today.  <br />
<br />
Closures: An area closure is in effect on Colville National Forest lands in the vicinity of the Bulldog Mountain Fire. <br />
For more information on area and road closures on the Colville National Forest, please visit: <br />
https://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fseprd938379.pdf <br />
<br />
Citizens are asked to stay clear of the fire area and comply with area closures.  <br />
<br />
While current weather conditions provide respite from the extreme fire potential present in northeast Washington, <br />
the forest can quickly dry out again in the many weeks of fire season ahead. Please continue to do all you can to <br />
prevent wildfires. <br />
<br />
The Colville National Forest is at IFPL level 3. Road closures remain in effect.  <br />
<br />
The Incident Command Post is located in Inchelium, WA. A spike camp will remain in place in Kettle Falls, WA to <br />
support the Bulldog Mountain and Mack Mountain Fires.</span>

Firefighters continue to make progress toward containment of the Gales Fire, using strategic ignitions at key <br />
locations to reinforce completed hand and dozer lines. <br />
<br />
While protecting life, communities and private property remain the primary objectives of suppression efforts, <br />
firefighters are also careful to protect natural, cultural and recreational values within the fire zone to the greatest <br />
extent possible. <br />
<br />
There are ten resource advisors, called READs, assigned to the Gales Fire and two assigned to the much <br />
smaller Kwis Fire. READs are specialists in fields ranging from botany and archaeology to wildlife that work with <br />
firefighters to identify sensitive sites and strategies for protecting them. <br />
<br />
For example, archaeology READs are flagging routes for heavy equipment operators to cut line without <br />
damaging indigenous sites. Others are working with firefighters to protect early trails and camps along the <br />
Saddleblanket Mountain and Alpine Trails.<br />
<br />
Natural resource protection strategies range from using water instead of retardant to avoid contaminating <br />
waterways to avoiding nest patches or leaving some large woody debris in streambeds for salmonid spawning. <br />
<br />
The Kwis Fire is near containment at 1,485 acres, although interior burning will continue for some time. Crews <br />
continue to mop up and patrol for hot spots and flare ups. <br />
<br />
Weather: Red Flag conditions are expected to continue today, with potential for increased fire activity and column <br />
formation. A shift in wind direction should push smoke to the east driving out the stagnant smoke.<br />
<br />
Closures: Closure orders remain in effect around the Kwis and Gales Fires. Full text of these orders and maps of <br />
closed areas on the Willamette National Forest can be found at https://go.usa.gov/xFEP2. An interactive map <br />
showing all public land closures in the Pacific Northwest can be found at tinyurl.com/4j3fxy8y. Private land <br />
accessibility can be found at this website: http://www.ofic.com/private-forestland-closures/</span>

Summary:  The Rough Patch Complex and Jack fire are being managed under a full suppression strategy using <br />
direct and indirect tactics to minimize fire spread to prevent loss of valuable resources. Leaders’ intent is to <br />
minimize any fire progression to the west and to protect private structures throughout the fire area. The Rough <br />
Patch consists of four fires: Chaos, Little Bend, Buckhead and Near Minky. Overall, there was minimum fire <br />
activity yesterday across the Rough Patch Complex and the Jack fire. Much of the fire growth was due to indirect <br />
burning operations conducted as a tactic to secure the fires’ perimeters in areas where direct suppression tactics <br />
poses a risk to firefighter safety.  <br />
<br />
  <br />
<br />
Chaos and Little Bend Fires:  The Chaos fire is at 16,539 acres and the Little Bend fire is at 6,717 acres. Fireline <br />
on the west side of the Chaos fire continues to hold. Today crews will be prepping the north end of Chaos fire to <br />
conduct additional burning operations as weather and fuel conditions allow. Structure protection needs are being <br />
evaluated north of the Chaos fire near the Bohemia Mine. Yesterday the southern edge of the Chaos fire was <br />
active along the 3821; crews were busy mopping up from previous days burning with support from aircraft doing <br />
water drops. Today, they will continue improving line south toward the Little Bend fire and prepping for burning <br />
operations with the goal of securing the southern end of the Chaos into the western end of the Little Bend fire in <br />
the coming days. <br />
<br />
  <br />
<br />
Jack and Buckhead Fires:  The Jack fire is at 23,884 acres and the Buckhead fire is at 3,286 acres. The west, <br />
north, and northeast end of the Jack fire has been contained and is being patrolled. Fire crews continue to <br />
improve fire line on the southwest section of the Jack fire where it meets the Buckhead fire. Today’s operations <br />
include improving line for future burning operations along the southwestern border when conditions are <br />
favorable. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Near Minky Fire:  The Near Minky fire is at 4,676 acres. This fire is located south of the Jack and Buckhead fires. <br />
The eastern edge and a portion of the western edge have been contained. The focus is now on the northwest <br />
corner and the southern end of the Near Minky fire. Northern Rockies Team 1 and Florida Red Team are working <br />
on a joint strategy for the Near Minky and Smith fires to limit western spread and share resources. <br />
<br />
  <br />
<br />
Weather:  Temperatures will be slightly cooler than yesterday with relative humidity in the mid-20’s. Northeast <br />
winds will switch to northwest in the afternoon, the same as yesterday. This weather has the potential to increase <br />
fire activity on both the Rough Patch Complex and the Jack fire. Expect dense smoke in the lower elevations <br />
until the afternoon when winds shift to the north.</span>

<br />
Yesterday: With resources stretched thin across multiple fires in the west, fire managers on the Schneider <br />
Springs Fire requested and were able to receive additional firefighting resources to come in for a short duration <br />
to execute critical firing operations. These resources come from multiple jurisdictions to assist in the strategy to <br />
contain the southern perimeter and prevent the fire from moving towards Naches and impacting private and <br />
commercial property north of the US 12 corridor. Yesterday, crews continued the firing operation south of the Nile <br />
community on Malloy Road to Bethel Ridge. In the northeast portion of the fire, dozers and crews improved an <br />
indirect containment line along Forest Road 258 toward Highway 410 around Gold Creek. Firefighters continue <br />
to monitor fire activity in this area, which continues to slowly back down steep slopes with rolling debris. Crews <br />
were also able to complete approximately one mile of firing operations off Forest Road 199 to protect the <br />
communication tower on the southwest portion of the fire.<br />
<br />
Today: In the next several days, firefighters will continue to implement the strategy to contain the southern fire <br />
perimeter from Bethel Ridge to the William O. Douglas wilderness boundary on the Okanogan-Wenatchee <br />
National Forest. The surge resources remain on the fire today to hold and secure the containment lines along <br />
Malloy Road and Bethel Ridge from the firing operation of the past few days. Additional smoke is anticipated <br />
today as the intentionally ignited fire along the southern containment line grows into the main fire area. Crews <br />
and aerial resources will patrol the perimeter, cooling hot spots and looking for and containing spot fires outside <br />
of containment lines. Firefighters are also holding and securing the one mile of indirect containment line off <br />
Forest Road 199 to protect the communication tower. Structure protection crews are nearly finished with their <br />
property defense work and the construction of indirect fire line along Highway 410 north of Cliffdell. Firefighters <br />
working the night shift will continue firing operations on the southern edge of the fire as needed, secure and <br />
patrol fire activity on Bethel Ridge, and patrol the Bumping River Corridor and structures along the east flank of <br />
the fire.<br />
<br />
Evacuations: LEVEL 3: Bumping River Road from north to south; LEVEL 2: Hwy 410 from Bumping River Road <br />
to U.S. Route 12. LEVEL 1: From U.S. 12 at Hwy 410 west to Tieton Reservoir Road; Yakima County Office of <br />

Inchelium, WA – Yesterday, forest fuels continued a drying trend due to sunny and windy weather, as well as <br />
lower humidity which caused increased fire activity in unburned fuels.  The fire was active on the north and <br />
northeast flanks and continued backing toward containment lines.  <br />
<br />
Firefighters worked to secure direct and indirect lines and conducted burning operations to improve containment <br />
lines. A small spot fire was detected outside the north perimeter in the Hall Creek area and was suppressed with <br />
air and ground resources. Mop-up and patrol continued around the southeast, south, and west flanks.  <br />
<br />
Today, crews will continue mop-up and monitor the spot fire. Firefighters will also continue to improve direct and <br />
indirect fire lines, with ongoing preparation of contingency lines along roads in the Lynx Mountain area. Patrolling <br />
and mopping up along the rest of the perimeter will continue.  <br />
<br />
On all unlined portions of the fire, the strategy is to build fire line as close to the fire’s edge as possible, and to <br />
strengthen these lines with small-scale burning where it can be effective. <br />
<br />
A warming and drying trend forecast into Monday, with temperatures expected near 80 degrees, will likely <br />
increase fire behavior. Tuesday into Wednesday, a subtle cooling trend is expected with a slight chance of rain.  <br />
<br />
The Colville Reservation has reopened to industrial activities and the general public. For your safety, please stay <br />
out of the fire areas as there is still heavy equipment and crews working in and around the Summit Trail fire.  <br />
<br />
Prevention Message: While current weather conditions provide respite from the extreme fire potential present in <br />
northeast Washington, the forest can quickly dry out again in the many weeks of fire season ahead. Please <br />
continue to do all you can to prevent wildfires. <br />
<br />
Smoke: Current drying conditions and increased fire activity may result in increased smoke.   <br />
<br />

The Colville Reservation moved from IFPL 4 to IFPL 3 yesterday.  <br />

<br />
Yesterday the fire was very active along the southern perimeter in the vicinity of Slide Peak where firing <br />
operations were used to slow and direct the fires movement. In the late afternoon, firing tactics were initiated <br />
near Grouse Mountain where the fire made a northwesterly run. The operation was successful and was <br />
monitored throughout the night. Crews began back hauling equipment from Baldy Spike Camp and the western <br />
perimeter was mostly unstaffed as containment lines have been completed along Devil’s Backbone. The <br />
structure protection group continued work along First Creek Road.<br />
<br />
Today active to very active fire behavior is anticipated. The fire is expected to move to the west, southwest and <br />
south. Containment lines are expected to be completed along the southern perimeter where firing operations will <br />
be used when necessary for reinforcement.  Active fire behavior is expected to continue today in the vicinity of <br />
Grouse Mountain where firing will likely continue throughout the day. Containment lines along the northeastern <br />
perimeter will be in watch and hold status and any spots or threats to containment lines will be addressed.  The <br />
structure protection group will test water delivery systems (pumps, tanks, and hoses) along First Creek Road.<br />
<br />
Fields Point Landing is open to the public for ferry parking, pick up and drop off. Fire support operations are <br />
ongoing at Fields Point. Members of the public are reminded to yield to fire traffic and to stay in areas clearly <br />
marked for public use.<br />
<br />
Rotor and fixed-wing air resources will continue attack on the fire throughout the day and improved weather <br />
conditions make the use of aviation assets more likely today. Aircraft may use local bodies of water, including <br />
Lake Chelan, to fill. Recreational boaters should be aware of aircraft takeoff and landings and keep a safe <br />
distance.<br />
<br />
The Twentyfive Mile Fire was first reported at 3:45 p.m. on August 15, 2021. The fire was initially burning on the <br />
south shore of Lake Chelan near Twentyfive Mile Creek and has expanded south and west of the area. The fire <br />
is under joint jurisdiction of the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest, Washington Department of Natural <br />
Resources, Bureau of Land Management and Chelan County Fire District 7.<br />
<br />
Weather: Sunny and warm with light southerly winds in the morning, increasing and becoming westerly in the <br />
afternoon. Temperatures will be in the mid-80’s in the valleys and mid-60’s to mid-70’s on the ridgetops. Humidity <br />
will be in the high teens to mid-20’s. Today will be the warmest and driest day since the fire was detected.<br />
<br />
Evacuations: The most up-to-date evacuation information is available through Chelan County Emergency <br />
Management at the following links. Current evacuation levels remained in place overnight and will continue <br />
throughout the day. The Chelan County Sherriff will update evacuation levels as conditions warrant.</span>

<br />
The Chickadee Creek Fire is located approximately 15 miles west of Tonasket, Washington. The Walker Creek <br />
Fire is located approximately 13 miles east/northeast of Tonasket, Washington, surrounding Lake Bonaparte. The <br />
Incident Command Post at the Omak Stampede Grounds is closed to all but essential personnel to help ensure <br />
the health and safety of community members and firefighters. Today is expected to be the warmest and driest <br />
day of the week, with temperatures in the low-to-mid 80s.<br />
 <br />
Operations:<br />
Cooler weather over the last few days has enabled firefighters to make good progress building and securing fire <br />
line, and as a result containment on both fires increased significantly today. Higher temperatures and lower <br />
humidity today may cause an uptick in fire behavior, so crews will be alert.<br />
 <br />
Chickadee Creek Fire<br />
Helicopter water bucket drops were utilized on the northeast portion of the fire to slow fire spread near direct <br />
control lines. Fire crews continued to construct direct lines where possible and worked to complete indirect lines <br />
along the southern and western flanks of the fire yesterday. Firefighters are continuing to burn remaining pockets <br />
of fuels on the eastern portion of the fire to secure that perimeter. Work is ongoing building hose lays around the <br />
fire perimeter to enable water delivery to the fire edge for mop-up.<br />
 <br />
Walker Creek Fire<br />
Firefighters are working to complete indirect line in the northeastern portion of the fire due to rugged terrain and <br />
limited access that precludes direct line construction. Fire crews are mopping up along Forest Road 33 on the <br />
northern fire perimeter and are continuing mop-up and patrol around structures south of Bonaparte Lake. <br />
Firefighters are continuing indirect line construction toward Lost Lake Road on the northwestern portion of the <br />
fire. Yesterday, firefighters secured a spot fire on the southern fire perimeter created by a tree torching near the <br />
containment lines.<br />
 <br />
Evacuations:<br />
Evacuation levels were reduced yesterday. Details can be viewed at the Okanogan County Walker Creek and <br />
