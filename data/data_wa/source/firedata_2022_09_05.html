The Boulder Mountain Fire started by lightning on Wednesday August 31, 2022 at approximately 8:30 pm. The fire is located in the Tacoma <br />
Creek and Boulder Mountain area 9 miles Northwest of Cusick, Washington. The fire is burning on Federal, State and Private land. The terrain <br />
is difficult and the fire is burning in heavy timber, slash, and beetle infested trees.<br />
<br />
Yesterday: The fire was still very active during the day and overnight due to low humidity recoveries. This allowed for group torching, flanking, <br />
and backing. Access from the ground continues to be a challenge. Aircraft has been the primary fire suppression tactic to date. Crews <br />
continued to scout the area to make access to the fire from the ground. Dozers worked to shore up roads, create additional access, and assist <br />
firefighters on the ground where necessary. Due to the active fire behavior the fire has grown to an estimated 1400 acres. The weather event <br />
that moved through the area did not create any significant challenges for firefighters.<br />
<br />
Today: Firefighters will continue their work with dozers and other heavy equipment to get containment lines in and work on primary and <br />
secondary ingress and egress points. That work consists of chipping and masticating to create a better road system. Aircraft will continue to <br />
be utilized as needed. The fire will continue to be active with torching, backing and moving into slash. Additional resources have been ordered <br />
and over the last few days have showed up and are being assigned to different divisions of the fire.<br />
<br />
Weather: A warm and dry weather pattern will establish across the area after the disturbances on Saturday. This will continue through much of <br />
the week. Light terrain winds, moderate inversions, and poor relative humidity recovery at night will maintain active fire behavior.<br />
<br />
Transition: The Type 2 Incident Management Team has been briefed and they will officially take the fire over at 06:00 tomorrow morning. The <br />
team is in place and have been briefed on strategy and tactics to date. This transition is expected to be smooth and seamless. The team <br />
brings additional overhead and access to resources due to the high priority of the fire.<br />
<br />
Please continue to check the following sites for updated evacuation notices and campground closures. For campgrounds you can go to <br />
dnr.wa.gov and find up to date evacuation notices at: https://pendoreilleco.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Boulder-Mountain-Fire-Level-3-<br />
Evacuation-Area.pdf<br />
<br />
Firefighter and public safety are the highest priority. We ask that the public adhere to the notices and closures that have been put in place. <br />
Firefighters will continue their work in the Tacoma Creek and Boulder Mountain area. Please stay clear of that area.<br />

Current Situation: Fire activity was moderate yesterday due to cloud cover in the morning and higher humidities. Firefighters attempted to <br />
engage the fire where it crossed the retardant line near Edith Creek, but could not gain safe access because of extremely steep slopes. <br />
Firefighters initiated a strategic firing operation in the southwest area of the fire on Forest Service Road 2421. Humidities were very high, <br />
making ignition difficult, but they were able to make some progress. Today, fire behavior is expected to be slow and steady because of <br />
seasonal weather in the forecast. Today’s Activities: Fire managers have started implementing a new plan in the southeast area of the fire, <br />
where the fire crossed over the fire-retardant line. Crews will be enhancing the area around Black Creek to use as a barrier to stop fire growth <br />
to the south. In the northern area, firefighters are utilizing Winchester Trail as a checking line to slow fire growth. In the southwest, crews are <br />
utilizing small firing operations to keep the fire north of Forest Service Road 2421.<br />
 <br />
Closures: All of the Waldo Campground's and Waldo Road are closed. Kiahane Campground and Box Canyon are closed. Forest Road 19 ( <br />
Aufderheide Scenic Byway) is closed from Kiahane Campground to Upper RoaringRiver. An expanded Area Closure is in place as of August <br />
23rd for the Cedar Creek Fire. This includes all trailheads and dispersed camping west and north of Waldo Lake. A Temporary Flight <br />
Restriction (TFR) is in place.<br />
<br />
Evacuations: These evacuation notices are a combined effort of Lane County Sheriff’s Office and Deschutes County Sheriff's Office <br />
Oregon.</span>

Weather: Lighter winds from the west and northwest at less than 10mph are expected along ridgetops today. Skies will be clear most of <br />
the day. Conditions will be very dry and temperatures above normal, into the 80s and lower 90s. <br />
<br />
Operations: Yesterday, winds gusting up to speeds of 50 mph on the ridgetops challenged firefighting efforts on the north edge of the fire. <br />
Even with lower temperatures and an increase in relative humidity, fire activity continued to test containment lines. Firefighters were able to <br />
locate and contain several spot fires west of FSR 45 with the support of aircraft. Several smokejumpers have been assigned on the north end of <br />
the fire to wrap the Indian Rock Lookout with protective, heat-resistant fabric. Increased fire activity and high winds in the area have created <br />
challenges to accomplishing the project. Wrapping of the lookout should be completed today and firefighters will be engaged in the area <br />
throughout the shift. Resources will be engaging on the northeast corner of the fire to construct both direct and indirect line in areas with the <br />
highest probability of successful containment. Work continues today to hold containment line along FSR 45 on the western flank, as well as <br />
slowing fire spread on the north edge of the fire. Hotshot crews will be working with aerial firefighting resources on areas of the line that are <br />
threatened by shifting winds and rising temperatures. Engines, heavy equipment, and crews continue working to increase <br />
containment along the southern edge. <br />
<br />
Closures and Evacuations: Grant County has issued a Level One evacuation advisory in the area of the fire. Level One means be ready <br />
and aware of fire conditions. You can view a map of the evacuation zone on the Grant County Emergency Management Facebook page. <br />
An expanded closure is in effect on the Malheur and Umatilla National Forests today. For complete closure information, please go to: <br />

Highlights: There was significant fire growth on the Double Creek and Eagle Cap Wilderness Fires on Saturday as a result of strong winds, hot <br />
temperatures, and extremely dry conditions. The Oregon Office of the State Fire Marshal (OSFM) Green Team was mobilized on Saturday <br />
evening and will be in unified command with Pacific Northwest Team 2 for the Double Creek Fire.<br />
<br />
Double Creek Fire: 37,862 acres | 0% contained | 232 personnel assigned The lightning caused Double Creek Fire is a full suppression fire, <br />
and the protection of lives and property remain the primary objectives of this incident. On Saturday, the Double Creek Fire experienced <br />
significant growth to the north along Grizzly Ridge and east toward the Snake River. To the south, the fire backed down the Granny Creek <br />
drainage toward Freezeout Road. Firefighters were engaged in protecting private lands and infrastructure along the Imnaha River corridor on <br />
Saturday but were pushed to areas of refuge on several occasions due to intense and erratic fire behavior. Firefighters and aviation resources <br />
responded to evacuate several hunting parties that had been isolated due to the large fire growth. Despite a forecast for lighter winds on <br />
Sunday, warm and dry conditions will result in active fire behavior on the east and west slopes of Grizzly Ridge and additional fire spread to <br />
the north. Fire will continue backing downslope toward the Imnaha River in the Schleur, Adams, College, Double, and Blackmore Creeks. On <br />
Sunday, firefighters will be working with task forces from the Oregon Office of the State Fire Marshal to protect property and infrastructure <br />
along the Upper Imnaha Road.<br />
<br />
Weather: A strong upper disturbance and cold front passed through the area Saturday afternoon bringing isolated showers, gusty winds over <br />
60 mph, relative humidity values of 6 to 10 percent, and temperatures reaching the low-90s. Conditions improved Saturday night with cooler <br />
temperatures and good humidity recovery. On Sunday, temperatures are forecast to be in the upper-70s to low-80s with southwest winds at 8-<br />
12 mph, gusting to 20 mph. While temperatures will remain warm, relative humidity will be higher than Saturday reaching about 20 percent.<br />
<br />
Smoke: With an increase in fire activity across the Double Creek and Eagle Cap Wilderness Fires on Saturday, coupled with cooler overnight <br />
temperatures and higher relative humidity values, smoke is expected to settle in the lower elevations and drainages in the early morning <br />
hours. Current air quality information for the local area is available on the PurpleAir website.<br />
<br />
Evacuations: There are current evacuations in place for the Double Creek Fire. Hat Point and Freezeout Roads are under a Level 3 “Go Now” <br />
evacuation. The Hat Point Road is also closed due to the fire activity. Imnaha River Road, from Rippleton Creek to the Imnaha Grange is <br />
under a Level 2 “Get Set” evacuation. Imnaha River Road, from the town of Imnaha to Rippleton Creek and from the Imnaha Grange to the <br />
Pallette Ranch including Imnaha River Woods is under a Level 1 “Be Ready” evacuation. <br />
<br />
Closures: There are currently trail and road closures in effect for the Double Creek Fire as well as the Eagle Cap Wilderness Fires. Closure <br />
Orders and Maps are available on the Wallowa Whitman National Forest Fire Incident Updates page. Wallowa County issued an Order to <br />
restrict use of the Upper Imnaha Road from Imnaha to the junction of Upper Imnaha Road and Forest Service Road 39.Restrictions: Forest <br />
Order <br />
#06-16-00-22-04 covers Phase B Fire Restrictions for all National Forest System Lands within the Wallowa-<br />
Whitman National Forest, except for the area within a ¼ mile of the Snake River between Hells Canyon Dam, River Mile 247.5, downstream <br />
to the Oregon-Washington border at Snake River Mile 176.0, which is regulated by Forest Order #06-16-04-22-01.</span>

<br />
September 4, 2022<br />
<br />
Suppression Strategy – Fire managers are continuing to implement our long-term strategy including the use of primary and contingency <br />
perimeter lines for containment. Tactics include completion and reinforcement of fire lines (roads and hand line).<br />
<br />
Operations – A more seasonal, cooler weather pattern moves over the fire area tomorrow moderating fire behavior. Smoke may continue to be <br />
visible over the next several weeks as remaining interior fuels continue to smolder and burn out. Firefighters will continue to actively manage <br />
both fires over the coming weeks with a long-term strategy in place. Due to moderating fire behavior, fire updates will transition to every other <br />
day meaning there will be no update tomorrow. Daily updates may resume if a change in fire activity occurs.<br />
<br />
White River Fire - Acres: 1,348; 1% contained<br />
Location: Sears Creek area of the White River drainage, approximately 14 miles NW of Plain, WA.<br />
 <br />
A cold front moved into the area yesterday and brought gusty winds out of the northwest. The increased winds caused some interior burning <br />
and smoke throughout the fire. The fire was most active in the southeast corner; however, the fire experienced minimal growth. Today, <br />
firefighters will continue to monitor the southern portion of the fire while remaining ready for initial attack on any new fire starts.<br />
 <br />
Irving Peak Fire - Acres: 2,937; 7% contained<br />
Location: Approximately 16 miles NW of Plain, WA<br />
The Irving Peak Fire saw limited growth primarily on the northwest corner influenced by breezy conditions. The fire experienced low-to-<br />
moderate fire behavior with backing, flanking and short-range spotting. Containment lines on the southern flank continue to hold. On the <br />
eastern edge, the fire crossed Ninemile Creek, but is currently holding in place. Today, firefighters will improve containment lines while <br />
monitoring the fire as it backs down towards containment lines. Firefighters will also remain ready to assist with any new initial attacks.<br />
 <br />
Weather and Fire Behavior – Winds will be breezy again today as another dry cold front approaches the region. Westerly wind with gusts of <br />
20 to 30 mph is expected, with the highest gusts across the ridgetops. Afternoon relative humidity will be slightly lower than yesterday, but will <br />
remain above critical levels.<br />
<br />
Air quality and smoke outlook – https://outlooks.airfire.org/outlook/84d849be and at Washington Smoke Blog https://wasmoke.blogspot.com/<br />
<br />
Closures – please visit the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest - Home (usda.gov).<br />
<br />
<br />
Evacuations- Current Chelan County evacuation levels include a Level 2 evacuation (Be Prepared) for Sears Creek Road and Level 1 (Stay <br />
Alert) for White River Road and Little Wenatchee Road. https://www.co.chelan.wa.us/emergency-management/pages/active-emergencies<br />
<br />
Recreation impacts- In addition to the Forest closure and fire restrictions, fire officials recommend avoiding recreating in the Little Wenatchee <br />
and White River Road (FS Roads 6500 and 6400) areas. Smoke is visible from the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT). The PCT remains open and is <br />
not directly impacted by the fires. However, the Little Wenatchee Ford and White River Trailheads are closed and cannot be used to access <br />
the PCT. The Buck Creek-Spider Meadow Loop is open and accessible, but smoke and nearby fire activity may impact the area.<br />
<br />
Safety message – The public is asked to please watch out for firefighters and firefighting vehicle traffic in the area. Are you pulling a trailer or <br />
boat this holiday weekend? With the low humidity and high temperatures, a small spark from a dragging safety chain can quickly create a <br />
large fire. Please be responsible and take a moment to check your tow chains.</span>

Firefighters are taking advantage of cooler, more humid weather to make progress containing the Rum Creek Fire. In the last few days, <br />
containment has risen to 27%. “Containment” is an expression of confidence that the control lines will hold given the expected fire behavior <br />
and weather.<br />
<br />
Nearly the entire Rum Creek Fire is encircled by well-defined control lines. Natural fire spread or tactical firing operations have burned the <br />
fuels adjacent to these lines. Crews are mopping up burned areas near the fire’s edges, searching for any hidden pockets of heat that might <br />
flare up later and allow the fire to escape fire lines. All of these remaining hot spots must be extinguished to secure the fire edge.<br />
<br />
Portions of the fire line will not be declared “contained” until fire managers agree that pieces of fire perimeter have been thoroughly cooled <br />
and will not escape. An increase in containment represents a lot of work: planning and preparing fire lines, deploying hose lays, tactical firings, <br />
monitoring for spot fires outside the lines, mopping up, and repeated checks with more mop up as needed.<br />
<br />
On Saturday, fire personnel continued tactical firing on the northwest side of the fire. Firing operations were suspended when smoke was too <br />
thick for ignited fuels to burn well. Crews plan to complete firing operations today, connecting the line from Mount Peavine north to the Rogue <br />
River.<br />
<br />
Tactical firing will continue on the northeast side of the fire, where the fire is slowly progressing through the McKnabe Creek drainage. To the <br />
north and south, crews continue to mop up areas near Grave Creek and Stratton Creek.<br />
<br />
On Saturday, the Office of State Fire Marshal began demobilizing task forces from the Rum Creek Fire. Two task forces were reassigned to <br />
the Double Creek Fire, others are returning to their home units. Other OSFM resources will remain on the Rum Creek Fire for the next three <br />
operational shifts. They continue to mop up remaining hot spots near structures, cutting hazard trees, and patrolling areas along Galice Road. <br />
Firefighters are working on structure assessment and pre-planning to the north and southeast of the fire.<br />
<br />
On Saturday, the aircraft with Distributed Real-Time Infrared (DRTI) completed its last mapping flight for Rum Creek Fire.  It has been <br />
reassigned to a fire with a greater need for its capabilities. Other resources will be released as they are no longer needed, allowing them to go <br />
to other fires or back home to prepare for their next assignments.<br />
<br />
Evacuations: Existing evacuation orders and notifications remain in place. An interactive map showing evacuation levels according to address <br />
can be found at //JosephineCounty.gov/FireMap. For the most current evacuation information and resources, go to Josephine County Incident <br />
Information (rvem.org).<br />
<br />
Road control: Josephine County Sheriff’s Office has established traffic access points around the fire zone. Road blocks are located at Galice <br />
Road near Crow Road; Galice Store; Bear Camp Road at Peavine (top intersection); Lower Grave Creek Road at Angora Creek (Grays <br />
Ranch); Quartz Creek Road about 3 miles up (end of County maintenance); Dutch Henry Road near Kelsey Creek (42 44'56.2/123 40'35.4); <br />
and Hog Creek at Galice Road. The National Guard is staffing the roadblocks. Only residents (must show proof of residency) and permitted <br />
users will be allowed through.<br />
<br />
River status: The Wild section of the Rogue River below Grave Creek will remain open unless fire conditions warrant closure. River status is <br />
determined on a day-to-day basis. Please call 541-471-6535 for more information regarding Rogue River permits. No new boating permits will <br />
be issued at this time.</span>

<br />
Suppression Strategy – Fire managers are continuing to implement our long-term strategy including the use of primary and contingency <br />
perimeter lines for containment. Tactics include completion and reinforcement of fire lines (roads and hand line).<br />
<br />
Operations – A more seasonal, cooler weather pattern moves over the fire area tomorrow moderating fire behavior. Smoke may continue to be <br />
visible over the next several weeks as remaining interior fuels continue to smolder and burn out. Firefighters will continue to actively manage <br />
both fires over the coming weeks with a long-term strategy in place. Due to moderating fire behavior, fire updates will transition to every other <br />
day meaning there will be no update tomorrow. Daily updates may resume if a change in fire activity occurs.<br />
<br />
White River Fire - Acres: 1,348; 1% contained<br />
Location: Sears Creek area of the White River drainage, approximately 14 miles NW of Plain, WA.<br />
 <br />
A cold front moved into the area yesterday and brought gusty winds out of the northwest. The increased winds caused some interior burning <br />
and smoke throughout the fire. The fire was most active in the southeast corner; however, the fire experienced minimal growth. Today, <br />
firefighters will continue to monitor the southern portion of the fire while remaining ready for initial attack on any new fire starts.<br />
 <br />
Irving Peak Fire - Acres: 2,937; 7% contained<br />
Location: Approximately 16 miles NW of Plain, WA<br />
The Irving Peak Fire saw limited growth primarily on the northwest corner influenced by breezy conditions. The fire experienced low-to-<br />
moderate fire behavior with backing, flanking and short-range spotting. Containment lines on the southern flank continue to hold. On the <br />
eastern edge, the fire crossed Ninemile Creek, but is currently holding in place. Today, firefighters will improve containment lines while <br />
monitoring the fire as it backs down towards containment lines. Firefighters will also remain ready to assist with any new initial attacks.<br />
 <br />
Weather and Fire Behavior – Winds will be breezy again today as another dry cold front approaches the region. Westerly wind with gusts of <br />
20 to 30 mph is expected, with the highest gusts across the ridgetops. Afternoon relative humidity will be slightly lower than yesterday, but will <br />
remain above critical levels.<br />
<br />
Air quality and smoke outlook – https://outlooks.airfire.org/outlook/84d849be and at Washington Smoke Blog https://wasmoke.blogspot.com/<br />
<br />
Closures – please visit the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest - Home (usda.gov).<br />
<br />
<br />
Evacuations- Current Chelan County evacuation levels include a Level 2 evacuation (Be Prepared) for Sears Creek Road and Level 1 (Stay <br />
Alert) for White River Road and Little Wenatchee Road. https://www.co.chelan.wa.us/emergency-management/pages/active-emergencies<br />
<br />
Recreation impacts- In addition to the Forest closure and fire restrictions, fire officials recommend avoiding recreating in the Little Wenatchee <br />
and White River Road (FS Roads 6500 and 6400) areas. Smoke is visible from the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT). The PCT remains open and is <br />
not directly impacted by the fires. However, the Little Wenatchee Ford and White River Trailheads are closed and cannot be used to access <br />
the PCT. The Buck Creek-Spider Meadow Loop is open and accessible, but smoke and nearby fire activity may impact the area.<br />
<br />
Safety message – The public is asked to please watch out for firefighters and firefighting vehicle traffic in the area. Are you pulling a trailer or <br />
boat this holiday weekend? With the low humidity and high temperatures, a small spark from a dragging safety chain can quickly create a <br />
large fire. Please be responsible and take a moment to check your tow chains.</span>
