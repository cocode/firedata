Current Status: The recent cool and damp weather kept fire activity moderate yesterday even as the smoke <br />
cleared from some of the fire area. The overnight infrared flight was not able to get a new map due to a camera <br />
malfunction so there is no change in reported fire size again today. Additional containment line was completed on <br />
the south and eastern sides of the fire after several days of extensive mop up work and hazard tree removal <br />
done by firefighters. Wood and debris fuels conditions remain extremely dry, so the fire moved along the surface <br />
creeping, smoldering, and occasionally torching in the Upper Dickey Creek, Mother Lode Creek, and Battle <br />
drainages. Helicopter bucket water drops were used to slow fire spread in the Upper Dickey Creek drainage. On <br />
the south side the fire slowly backed downslope in the Elk Lake Creek and East Humbug Creek drainages. <br />
Crews continued to monitor that fire movement and mopped up along Forest Road 4696. Preparation of primary <br />
and contingency lines was done on road systems and hand lines north and northwest of the fire as part of the <br />
long-term fire suppression strategy.  This work is being done along an estimated 40 miles of forest roads and <br />
takes time. Hand line and road system preparation was done on both the southwest and southeast corners of the <br />
fire area. <br />
<br />
Planned Actions: Fire activity is expected to be moderated today but there is still a lot of heat with extremely dry <br />
fuels conditions on several sides of the fire. Firefighters can expect to see occasional surface fire, some group <br />
tree torching, smoldering, and backing down slopes throughout the day. Most of the fire activity will continue in <br />
the Upper Dickey Creek, Mother Lode Creek, Pansey Creek, and Battle Creek drainages where it has been most <br />
active for several days. Crews will monitor the fire as it backs downslope in the East Humbug Creek and Elk <br />
Lake Creek drainages. Five helicopters remain assigned to the fire and as smoke conditions allow are available <br />
to be used for water bucket drops. Firefighters will patrol and monitor along the south and east sides of the fire. <br />
Crews and equipment will be used to prepare lines on road systems north and northwest of the fire. Existing <br />
containment lines will be monitored as firefighters watch for any trees or pockets of heat that could threaten the <br />
lines. <br />
<br />
Weather: The weather forecast outlines seasonal conditions today with temperatures 70-75 degrees, minimum <br />
humidity levels from 45% to 55%, and winds out of the west/northwest at 5-10 mph with gusts up to 15 mph. <br />
<br />
Evacuations:  The Marion County Sheriff has issued a Level 1 “Be Ready” evacuation advisory only for <br />
Breitenbush Hot Springs. Residents should be aware of the danger that exists in their area, monitor emergency <br />
services websites and local media, and make an action plan should the evacuation level rise. The advisory can <br />
be viewed at:  https://www.flashalert.net/id/MarionSheriff?alert=1.  <br />
<br />
Closures:  For the safety of wildland firefighters and the public, the National Forests have enacted area closures <br />
that prevent the public from being upon National Forest System lands in the vicinity of the Bull Complex Fire. All <br />
Forest lands that are south and west of Forest Road 46, and east of the Riverside Fire perimeter are closed. The <br />
entire length of Forest Road 46 is closed. Lands within the 2020 Lionshead and Beachie Creek Fire areas are <br />
also closed.  See the closure orders and maps at https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/closures/7773/.</span>

<br />
Cedar Creek, Cub Creek 2, and Delancy Fires September 10, 2021 Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest<br />
<br />
Minimal fire behavior occurred in the Cedar Creek Fire this week, with limited isolated creeping and some <br />
torching in the Varden Creek drainage and near Slate Lake.   On the Cub Creek 2 Fire, some creeping has been <br />
observed around the Farewell and Lake Creek vicinity. No activity was observed on the Delancy Fire. Cooler <br />
temperatures and higher humidities are expected across both fires this weekend, reducing the likelihood of active <br />
fire behavior and smoke production for the next few days.<br />
<br />
Crews and heavy equipment continue to complete suppression repair across both fire areas, repairing firelines, <br />
felling hazard trees along roads, chipping debris, and repairing roads damaged by suppression activity. The <br />
shortage of personnel and equipment nationally, plus the need to prioritize these resources for active fires with <br />
immediate suppression needs, have slowed the progress of this work on the Cedar Creek and Cub Creek 2 fires. <br />
<br />
Closure Area Update:<br />
<br />
In the Cedar Creek Fire area, the existing closure order remains unchanged for the next week. As of September <br />
10, the closure order for the Cub Creek 2 Fire has changed:<br />
<br />
·       Forest Service Roads 51 and 5160 (west of the Chewuch River) from Eightmile Ranch to Andrews Creek <br />
Trailhead are now open.<br />
<br />
·       Andrews Creek Trailhead and all trails leaving from this site are now open, including Andrews Creek, Little <br />
Andrews Creek, Coleman Ridge, and Fire Creek. Past Andrews Creek Trailhead, the road to Thirtymile Trailhead <br />
remains closed to allow for completion of road repair work that was scheduled for July but deferred because of <br />
fire activity. All other roads, trails, and trailheads in the existing closure order remain closed as crews continue to <br />
complete suppression repair and remove hazardous trees.<br />
<br />
·       Camp 4 Campground is now open.<br />
<br />
·       All other campgrounds, dispersed campsites, and trails in the Cub Creek 2 Fire closure area remain closed, <br />
including Falls Creek and Chewuch Campgrounds and the trail to Falls Creek Falls.<br />
<br />
Visit USFS Pacific Northwest Region Emergency Closures for locations and details of current closures. Fire <br />
closure orders and maps are also available here. As more suppression repair work is completed over the next <br />
week, district staff will re-assess the extent of closure orders across both fires to look for more opportunities to <br />
open areas and trails. Meanwhile, we appreciate your patience and respect for these closures to ensure the <br />
safety of our firefighters and visitors.<br />

Fire managers continue to work in unified command and are closely coordinating with local agencies, resources, <br />
and community partners.<br />
<br />
The Oregon State Fire Marshal task forces completed a structural damage assessment yesterday and found four <br />
structures and six outbuildings were burned. At this time, the damage assessment team believes all impacted <br />
structures have been located, but that number could change as further assessments are completed, or fire <br />
behavior changes.<br />
<br />
The heel of the fire (south flank) has not changed over the past two days. Cooler weather, light winds and better <br />
visibility allowed resources to make substantial progress yesterday to lay hose and start mop up near roads, <br />
handlines and dozer lines.<br />
<br />
The west side of the fire is in difficult terrain with limited access; natural hazards such as drought weakened trees <br />
and powder dry soil. Crews are evaluating possible opportunities in this area to tie into road systems and <br />
establish indirect containment lines. When completed, strategic firing operations will be conducted.<br />
<br />
On the head of the fire (north flank) the majority of sagebrush and shrubs in this area were consumed during the <br />
intense wind event. Currently, very little heat remains. Firefighters are cold-trailing (feeling with the hand for heat) <br />
to reduce the impacts to remaining vegetation on these key grazing lands and further the containment on this <br />
portion of the fire.<br />
<br />
On the eastern flank, line has been constructed. Short pieces of line remain to be built today to tie together the <br />
entire flank.<br />
<br />
Behavior: Primary expected fire behavior consists of consumption of light surface fuels under protected canopies <br />
and of heavy fuels with single to small group torching. Drought and fire weakened trees will be impacted by the <br />
forecasted winds.</span>

Cedar Creek, Cub Creek 2, and Delancy Fires September 10, 2021 Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest<br />
<br />
Minimal fire behavior occurred in the Cedar Creek Fire this week, with limited isolated creeping and some <br />
torching in the Varden Creek drainage and near Slate Lake.   On the Cub Creek 2 Fire, some creeping has been <br />
observed around the Farewell and Lake Creek vicinity. No activity was observed on the Delancy Fire. Cooler <br />
temperatures and higher humidities are expected across both fires this weekend, reducing the likelihood of active <br />
fire behavior and smoke production for the next few days.<br />
<br />
Crews and heavy equipment continue to complete suppression repair across both fire areas, repairing firelines, <br />
felling hazard trees along roads, chipping debris, and repairing roads damaged by suppression activity. The <br />
shortage of personnel and equipment nationally, plus the need to prioritize these resources for active fires with <br />
immediate suppression needs, have slowed the progress of this work on the Cedar Creek and Cub Creek 2 fires. <br />
<br />
Closure Area Update:<br />
<br />
In the Cedar Creek Fire area, the existing closure order remains unchanged for the next week. As of September <br />
10, the closure order for the Cub Creek 2 Fire has changed:<br />
<br />
·       Forest Service Roads 51 and 5160 (west of the Chewuch River) from Eightmile Ranch to Andrews Creek <br />
Trailhead are now open.<br />
<br />
·       Andrews Creek Trailhead and all trails leaving from this site are now open, including Andrews Creek, Little <br />
Andrews Creek, Coleman Ridge, and Fire Creek. Past Andrews Creek Trailhead, the road to Thirtymile Trailhead <br />
remains closed to allow for completion of road repair work that was scheduled for July but deferred because of <br />
fire activity. All other roads, trails, and trailheads in the existing closure order remain closed as crews continue to <br />
complete suppression repair and remove hazardous trees.<br />
<br />
·       Camp 4 Campground is now open.<br />
<br />
·       All other campgrounds, dispersed campsites, and trails in the Cub Creek 2 Fire closure area remain closed, <br />
including Falls Creek and Chewuch Campgrounds and the trail to Falls Creek Falls.<br />
<br />
Visit USFS Pacific Northwest Region Emergency Closures for locations and details of current closures. Fire <br />
closure orders and maps are also available here. As more suppression repair work is completed over the next <br />
week, district staff will re-assess the extent of closure orders across both fires to look for more opportunities to <br />
open areas and trails. Meanwhile, we appreciate your patience and respect for these closures to ensure the <br />
safety of our firefighters and visitors.<br />

Current Situation:<br />
<br />
The cooperative weather of the last two days allowed fire managers to modify containment strategies in Divisions <br />
G and A on the north side and adopt a smaller footprint. Indirect line preparation continues as a contingency and <br />
will provide additional defense should fire move out of primary lines. The high humidity, cool temperatures, and <br />
calm winds diminished flame heights and fire spread enabling firefighters to work directly on the edge. Despite <br />
calmer fire behavior, several spot fires were detected yesterday. Firefighters were aggressive in their response <br />
and placed fireline around the spot fires.<br />
<br />
Today, skies will be clear of smoke and clouds which will impact fire behavior, promoting burning activity on south <br />
and southwestern facing slopes due to solar heating of fuels. Weather will also be warm with average <br />
temperatures in the mid 70s and humidity about 40%, contributing to an uptick in fire behavior with fire activity <br />
starting earlier in the day. Fire behavior is not anticipated to be as active as early last week. With the clear <br />
conditions, crews will be supported by helicopters allowing for continued efforts on building line on uncontained <br />
edges, completing firing operations where feasible, and further securing contained perimeters. <br />
<br />
Smith Fire<br />
Acreage: 44,410 | Containment: 20%<br />
<br />
Branch I: Divisions E and F – Firefighters will continue patrol and mop-up. <br />
Division A and G – Across Divisions A and G, firefighters observed slow-moving fire due to the moist conditions. <br />
With the clear skies, helicopters were able to fly and three additional spot fires in the vicinity of Hemlock Lake <br />
were discovered. Firefighters worked to place fireline around the spots and will continue to secure spots today. In <br />
Division G, firefighters continued work on direct firelines and indirect firelines along Forest Road 2719.<br />
Branch II: Division B – Heavy equipment and chippers aided firefighters by helping to dispose of fuel east of Ash <br />
Valley. Removal of this vegetation would diminish fire behavior should winds shift and fire threaten structures <br />
from the east. Other work remains unchanged from yesterday; firefighters will continue preparations along <br />
Highway 28 and firelines will continue to be secured around structures. <br />
Divisions C and E – Today’s work will include patrol, mop-up, and securing of contained firelines, construction of <br />
uncontained firelines and assessing options for the uncontained finger near Ash Flat Campground.<br />
<br />
Big Hamlin Fire<br />
Acreage: 19,035 | Containment: 75%<br />
Branch III: Divisions J, L, and N – Firefighters will continue holding the fire in its current footprint through patrol <br />
and mop-up efforts.<br />
Divisions H – Yesterday, firefighters were moderately successful in introducing fire to Division H, but moist fuel <br />
conditions limited fire from establishing and carrying. Today, firefighters will be using fire as a tool again, and may <br />
be aided by a helicopter conducting aerial ignitions. Firefighters will also be supported by a crew of fallers <br />
removing standing dead trees and other trees that present hazards to firefighters or which could fall on Forest <br />
Roads 29 or 2925.<br />
<br />
Weather and Fuel Conditions:<br />
Sunny skies with little smoke and dry air are predicted for today. Temperatures will range from 70 to 80 degrees, <br />
depending on elevation, and humidity will average about 30%. These conditions will drive more active fire <br />
behavior with increased tree torching and the possibility of fire spread. Areas with heavy dead and downed trees <br />
will experience the most fire activity.<br />
<br />
Evacuation Notices:<br />
The Ash Creek-South Umpqua Road remains at a Level 3: Go (Leave immediately). As of 8 am on September <br />
11, Dumont 2810 to Jackson Creek was reduced to Level 1: Be Ready. The interactive web map depicts <br />

<br />
Current Situation: Green Ridge Fire:<br />
Yesterday: Moisture and increased humidity overnight kept fire behavior minimal, however smoldering continues <br />
in pockets of vegetation. No lateral spread or widening of the fire perimeter was observed. Overall conditions <br />
necessitate maintaining staffing levels and continuous evaluation of potential fire spread in drought stressed fuel <br />
type.<br />
<br />
Today: Firefighters will continue to focus on SW and SE and continue assessments further out and monitor and <br />
observe remote areas of southern perimeter. Firefighters continue to hold and improve completed lines to the <br />
west, continue to hold and improve completed lines to the south. Firefighters provide continued point protection <br />
of assets and resources. Finalize long term management strategy for southern branch.<br />
<br />
Weather & Smoke Information:<br />
Drying will persist through the Sunday. The westerly flow will continue through the first of the week with an <br />
occasional slight increase in wind as system pass just to the north of the region. Overall fuels conditions remain <br />
very dry and susceptible to fire spread. Fire managers will evaluate systems as they move through area but NO <br />
Season Ending type weather is forecast. Smoke information is available on Washington Smoke Blog at: <br />
https://wasmoke.blogspot.com/<br />
<br />
Forest Closures:<br />
Umatilla National Forest officials reopened most National Forest lands within the Lick Creek Fire footprint <br />
September 9, 2021. Additionally, access will be reopened into portions of the Tucannon River drainage. The <br />
modified closure prohibits access on the Pomeroy Ranger District to some roads and trails within the Lick Creek <br />
Fire burned area, National Forest lands surrounding the Green Ridge Fire, and lands surrounding the Elbow <br />
Creek Fire on the Walla Walla Ranger District.  <br />
<br />
Closure orders can be found at: https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/umatilla/alerts-notices/?cid=stelprdb5286768<br />
<br />
Evacuations:<br />
Level-1 evacuations (be ready, stay aware) remain in place in Garfield, Columbia and Asotin counties. For more <br />
information on evacuations, please visit your local county government web pages for full information.<br />
<br />
Temporary Flight Restrictions:<br />
For the safety of the firefighters and aircraft fighting the Green Ridge Fire, a 10-nautical mile Temporary Flight <br />
Restriction (TFR) is in place over the fire area through September 15, 2021. This TFR has a 10,000-foot ceiling. <br />
Wildfires are a “No Drone Zone.” Whenever a drone is spotted near the fire all aircraft are grounded until we can <br />
be sure the drone is clear of the area. For more information, visit http://knowbeforeyoufly.org.</span>

Incident Summary:  The Great Basin Incident Management Team 2 took command of the Rough Patch Complex <br />
and Jack Fires at 6:00 a.m. Both fires are being managed under a full suppression strategy using containment <br />
and confinement tactics to minimize fire spread to prevent loss of valuable resources.  Objectives include <br />
keeping the fires as small as possible while working toward full containment. <br />
<br />
Weather in the area is forecast to be cooler and more humid. Some precipitation was received across the fire <br />
Thursday night, with .10 to .30 inches of rain received in some locations.  It is predicted to remain at these <br />
seasonably lower temperatures for the next few days. Weather conditions east of the Cascades could bring more <br />
humidity and cloud cover to the fire area, perhaps even some drizzle on Friday. These changes reflect the typical <br />
patterns for this time of year and may have the potential to diminish fire activity, especially if prolonged over <br />
several days.  <br />
<br />
Chaos and Little Bend Fires:  The Chaos fire is at 24,462 acres and the Little Bend Creek Fire is at 8,569 acres.  <br />
On the north end of the Chaos Fire, firefighters assessed the spot fire that crossed the 2460 road.   It is currently <br />
burning at approximately three acres. With the very steep and rugged landscape in mind, crews have identified <br />
specific terrain features they are using in efforts to contain the spot and minimize its growth. Helicopters continue <br />
to support this priority with water drops and reconnaissance flights. On the southeast section of the Little Bend <br />
Creek Fire, crews are utilizing the 3816 road as a primary control line after the fire crossed over a section of the <br />
3850 road on Tuesday. <br />
<br />
Jack and Buckhead Fires:  The Jack Fire is at 23,990 acres and the Buckhead fire is at 6,536 acres.  The Jack <br />
Fire is contained along the west, north, and northeast perimeter. The fire has not grown for several days.  Fire <br />
crews are assessing the eastern edge for direct control operations. Firefighters are focusing on the southwest <br />
corner of the Buckhead Fire near the 100 road where they have contained small spot fires that resulted also <br />
during Tuesday’s wind event.  Due to the proximity of the Smith Fire, which is part of the Devil’s Knob Complex, <br />
close coordination is ongoing between the two Incident Management Teams managing each complex.  <br />
<br />
Near Minky Fire:  The Near Minky Fire is at 4,867 acres.  This fire lays south of the Jack and Buckhead Fires.  <br />
The entire perimeter is contained except for the northwest corner, which is where it connects to the Buckhead <br />
Fire. Activity has been minimal for approximately two weeks. <br />
<br />
Closures:  Copies of all closures and maps can be found at https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/closures/7758/. <br />
<br />
Amended BLM Roseburg District fire closure: BLM road 24-1-26 (Francis Creek) from the junction with BLM road <br />
25-1E-31 (Canton Creek Road) North to the Roseburg District Boundary in Township 24 South Range 1 West <br />
Section 1 will remain closed. <br />
 <br />
<br />
The Umpqua and Willamette National Forests have temporarily closed areas of both forests due to the Jack Fire, <br />
Rough Patch Complex Fire, and Devil's Knob Complex Fire. <br />
<br />
Highway 138 between Roseburg and Diamond remains open. Expect short delays for hazard tree removal <br />
operations east of Glide. Slow down and be alert.</span>

<br />
he reduction in acreage above is due to more accurate mapping. Prep work, including brushing and hauling of <br />
logs, is nearly completed along road 1920 to construct this contingency line. A reconnaissance mission was flown <br />
over the Nehi Creek drainage yesterday to evaluate known spot fires. However, the smoke in the drainage made <br />
it impossible to visualize the spots. The UAS will be utilized today to complete this task. The UAS will also be <br />
utilized for aerial ignition north of Drop Point 53. This is being done to strengthen fire lines  by increasing the <br />
depth of burned fuels. It is expected to be used for this and other aerial ignitions this week. Firefighters will be <br />
improving indirect lines on the east side of the fire and scouting opportunities to move indirect lines closer to the <br />
fire’s edge. <br />
<br />
There will be a virtual community briefing via Facebook on Tuesday, September 14th at 6:30 p.m. The briefing <br />
will be pre-recorded and posted to the Middle Fork Complex Facebook page. A Facebook account is not needed <br />
to view the briefing. All are welcome to submit questions and comments for additional information or clarification. <br />
Questions will be grouped by topics and answered as soon as possible.  <br />
<br />
Weather: Under a partly cloudy sky, temperatures will rise back into the upper 60s to low 70s.  Light winds will <br />
continue, coming out of the west to northwest at 4-8 mph with gusts up to 12 mph. Higher winds can be <br />
anticipated on the more elevated terrain. <br />
<br />
Smoke: Most areas should see “Good” or “Moderate” air quality today. Smoke from fires burning to our south, <br />
should stay aloft and not impact our air quality. It will create some haze particularly in Bend and La Pine. All in all, <br />
it should be a good day for outdoor activities. <br />
<br />
Safety:  We continue to secure roads by cleaning up around various contingency lines, moving slash and hauling <br />
logs and equipment. Please exercise caution on the roads over the next few days.  <br />
<br />
Closures: Road closures are still in effect in the surrounding areas of the fire perimeter. Please visit <br />
https://www.fs.usda.gov/alerts/willamette/alerts-notices for detailed information on closure orders and maps.</span>

<br />
Conconully, WA: Yesterday crews worked to secure containment lines, grid for hot spots, complete repair work <br />
on campgrounds, and backhauling equipment. Division Charlie (north portion of the fire) will stay focused today <br />
on securing perimeter lines, backhauling equipment, and gridding the area for hot spots. Division Xray (northeast <br />
portion of the fire) will grid for additional hot spots, secure perimeter lines, backhaul equipment, and look for <br />
additional repair work that needs done. Division Foxtrot (south end of the fire) has completed their objectives and <br />
is now in full patrol status. Turn back standards in the areas that are secured are now in full swing. Repair <br />
standards include: chipping and disbursing of large concentrations of unburned fuels created during suppression, <br />
identify and inventory fences, and any other damages that were created by suppression efforts. They will remove <br />
garbage, litter, and flagging. The only flagging that will remain in place are in hazard areas.   <br />
<br />
Weather today is expected to be 62 and sunny with humidity at 40%. Winds will be southeast around 3-5 mph in <br />

The Muckamuck Fire started by lightning on Saturday August 4, 2021. The fire is located in and around the Town <br />
of Conconully, Washington. Mixed conifer with dead and downed materials are the primary fuel source along with <br />
ponderosa pine, sagebrush, and cured grass meadows. The fire is estimated at 13,319 and is now 85% <br />
contained. During the first phase of the fire there were 4 primary and 3 secondary structures lost. <br />
<br />
Did you know? Roles and responsibilities of the team continued:Today we talk about the Finance Sections role <br />
on the team. There are typically 2-5 finance personnel on a small fire; the numbers increase as the number of <br />
resources increase. Imagine if you will; that you started a new company and on your first day of opening the <br />
doors you had 150 new employees and several vendors that you have to get in your system to pay. Each person <br />
needs a profile and they need to have their agencies contract information. Each person is given an employee <br />
number for tracking purposes and timesheets are due every 2 days. That is only the beginning; paperwork needs <br />
uploaded, verified, and updated time is recorded in the system. The other side of the coin is when the resource is <br />
released from the fire. Their information is verified by finance and the crew member signs their final timecard. <br />
This is finance in a nutshell however, their role is one of the most important and cumbersome. The finance <br />
section works approximately 15 hours a day 7 days a week on the fire.    <br />

<br />
Expected upcoming weather will rotate from hot and dry to cool with increased humidity throughout the week. <br />
This constant shift in weather will affect regions of the fire differently. It is anticipated that ridgelines will have <br />
lower humidity and may see increased weather activity while the slopes and canyons retain higher humidity <br />
levels and diminished fire activity. Firefighters continuously monitor fire behavior and assess actions as the day <br />
progresses. Objectives include keeping the fires as small as possible working toward full containment while <br />
preventing loss of valuable resources through full suppression.<br />
<br />
With highly variable humidity, the fire continued creeping and smoldering, creating smoke in the valleys. Post rain <br />
with gusty winds up to 12 miles per hour, green trees are falling due to weakened root structures from fire <br />
damage and soil becoming saturated. Firefighters are utilizing logging roads as containment lines and are <br />
continuing to conduct brushing operations – using masticators to remove vegetation along the roadways to <br />
strengthen containment lines.<br />
<br />
Chaos and Little Bend Fires:  The Chaos Fire is 24,462 acres and the Little Bend Creek Fire is 8,569 acres. On <br />
the north end of the Chaos Fire, firefighters were able to directly apply containment line to the spot fire that <br />
crossed the 2460 road. With the use of hose lay, roadbeds and rock features, this spot fire is holding at  three <br />
acres in size. Work is ongoing to strengthen those containment lines. Fire crews were able to utilize air resources <br />
and bucket drops to cool the fire on the southeast end of Little Bend. Crews are assessing the terrain to insert <br />
additional containment lines using old logging roads which would tighten up that edge of the fire.  Around 200 <br />
firefighters will move to the northeast of the Chaos Fire into an existing spike camp, sharing resources with the <br />
Middle Fork Complex.<br />
<br />
Jack and Buckhead Fires:  The Jack Fire is 23,990 acres and the Buckhead Fire is 6,535 acres. The Jack Fire <br />
has remained consistent in size with the west, north, and northeast perimeter contained. Firefighters are <br />
continuing to work on the southeastern portion of Buckhead to create containment with natural features and <br />
roadbeds. Crews are also beginning to scout for repair work and plan for that work to begin.<br />
<br />
Near Minky Fire:  The Near Minky Fire is at 4,867 acres. This stable, southern-most fire is being utilized to assist <br />
with the Smith Fire as it continues to move closer to its perimeter. The Rocky Mountain team managing the <br />
Devil’s Knob Complex has assumed operations around the western portion of the Near Minky Fire. This is being <br />
done to enhance their abilities to manage the Smith Fire safely and effectively.<br />
<br />
Closures:  Copies of all closures and maps can be found at https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/closures/7758/.<br />
<br />
Amended BLM Roseburg District fire closure: BLM road 24-1-26 (Francis Creek) from the junction with BLM road <br />
25-1E-31 (Canton Creek Road) North to the Roseburg District Boundary in Township 24 South Range 1 West <br />
Section 1 will remain closed.<br />
<br />
The Umpqua and Willamette National Forests have temporarily closed areas of both forests due to the Jack Fire, <br />
Rough Patch Complex Fire, and Devil's Knob Complex Fire.<br />
<br />
Highway 138 between Roseburg and Diamond remains open. Expect short delays for hazard tree removal <br />
operations east of Glide. Slow down and be alert.</span>

Yesterday: Precipitation from the day before moderated fire behavior across the areas of active fire. On the <br />
northwest, firefighters and air resources focused on structure protection around Bumping Lake and Goose Prairie <br />
and monitored the fire on American Ridge as it backed slowly down into the American River. On the northeast <br />
and east, structure protection continued along the Highway 410 corridor and crews assessed possibilities for <br />
constructing more direct fireline south and west of Forest roads 1706 and 1709. Crews continued to work to <br />
secure line and slow fire spread around Edgar Rock. Firing operations along the trail to Burnt Mountain were <br />
completed. Mop-up and repair work continued throughout the southern half of the fire. <br />

Today: Despite increased winds from a frontal passage, cooler temperature and higher relative humidity is <br />
expected to result in minimal fire behavior. Firefighting priorities are to establish an effective fire line north of Lost <br />
Creek (using the 1709 and 1706 road system), hoselays and fuel reduction work around structures in preparation <br />
for fire threat in the Cliffdell and Lost Creek communities, and establishing a fuel break to the west of the Goose <br />
Prairie area.  <br />
 <br />
Evacuations: LEVEL 3: Bumping River Road from north to south; all of Old River Road (NF1704),  including <br />

<br />
Although recent rainstorms helped to dampen fire activity on the Summit Trail Fire, the additional moisture also <br />
created several new hazards, including muddy roads and slick hillsides. As water infiltrates and softens the soil, <br />
tree root systems weakened by fire become increasingly vulnerable to falling over as multi-directional winds push <br />
through the canopies. To minimize exposure to these hazards, crews are concentrating on backhauling nearly <br />
one hundred miles of hose lines, supplies, and equipment from control lines where road conditions are favorable. <br />
<br />
Operations: Yesterday, dangerous road conditions prevented crews from accessing the northwestern portion of <br />
the fire area. As an alternative, crews focused on pulling several miles of unneeded hose lines along the western <br />
perimeter of the fire as well as the interior area near Sitdown Creek. Firefighters completed the final stages of <br />
mopup along the northern spur of the fire area down to Stall Creek. From Stall Creek to Little White Mountain, <br />
crews postponed work along handlines due to hazardous conditions on steep, wet, and unstable slopes. Air <br />
patrols detected a few smoking areas inside the fire perimeter, but no visible flames were observed. The <br />
Suppression Repair Group worked with Hancock Lumber and other cooperators to evaluate and process trees <br />
along the east side of Brush Mountain. Heavy equipment was moved into a staging area near the northern <br />
containment line. Today, crews will focus on backhauling more hose lines, mopping up remaining pockets of <br />
heat, and processing downed trees. With the possibility of isolated thunderstorms, aircraft will remain available to <br />
respond to any new lightning-caused fire starts. <br />
<br />
Weather: Another weather system and cold front will move across the area today, bringing scattered to numerous <br />
clouds and a slight chance of light showers or possibly a brief rumble of thunder. Slightly breezy conditions will <br />
also develop behind the cold front. High temperatures will be mild and afternoon humidity will remain high. A <br />
south to southwest wind in the morning will turn to the northwest and become breezy behind the cold front. The <br />
early part of the week will be partly cloudy and seasonably mild. Cool and breezy conditions and some light <br />
showers will accompany another cold front on Wednesday. <br />
<br />
Safety: The health and safety of firefighters and the public is the first priority. The public is strongly encouraged to <br />
stay safely clear of the active fire area. Firefighters are conducting operations under protocols to mitigate the risk <br />
of COVID-19.  <br />
<br />
Smoke: Smoke from the Summit Trail Fire, along with other fires in the region, may be visible in the area <br />
surrounding Inchelium. An interactive smoke map at https://wasmoke.blogspot.com/ allows you to zoom into your <br />
location to see the latest smoke information. Smoke-sensitive individuals and people with respiratory problems or <br />
heart disease are encouraged to take precautionary measures.</span>

<br />
Yesterday the fire made short upslope runs and burned actively through an island of unburned vegetation north <br />
of Stormy Mountain. While the fire did not threaten containment lines yesterday, the activity seen is an indicator <br />
that large fuels remain very dry and will continue to burn despite recent precipitation. Today will be partly to <br />
mostly sunny with seasonable temperatures. The afternoon will bring winds from the west or southwest with <br />
gusts to 20 mph on ridge tops. Although relative humidity will be lower than yesterday, humidity levels are still <br />
elevated and will delay drying in the grasses and other fine fuels.<br />
<br />
Yesterday: Crews completed most of the work needed to break down and remove the hoses, pumps, and other <br />
equipment around homes in the Lake Chelan corridor from south of Hollywood Beach to the First Creek area. <br />
Firefighters continued burning operations to increase the depth of containment line along devil’s backbone south <br />
west of the fire. They also continued to mop up and patrol the fire line east of Stormy Mountain and near <br />
Crescent Hill. Crews monitored the north and east edge of the fire which has held within containment lines and <br />
has shown no recent heat.<br />
<br />
Today: As conditions become favorable, firefighters will continue burnout operations along Devils Backbone, <br />
between Stormy Mountain and Angle Peak. They are working strategically to secure a containment line around <br />
the fire perimeter, focusing on increasing the depth of the containment line by removing vegetation adjacent to <br />
the line that could allow the fire to wick or spot across. Firefighters are monitoring the fire from Angle Peak north <br />
to Junior Point, and giving consideration to upcoming weather patterns, they are assessing needs and <br />
opportunities for securing the line through a rocky and sparsely vegetated area with scattered pockets of dead <br />
and downed wood. Structure protection crews plan to make another sweep from Twenty-five Mile to First Creek <br />
to complete breaking down and removing any of the remaining hoses and pumps.</span>

<br />
Tonasket, WA:  Yesterday, crews assessed the fire line after the rains and made progress in containing the <br />
remaining line in the area of Bunch and Fox road (south of USFS 030 road – Virginia Lilly area).  Crews will <br />
continue to patrol this area for any remaining fuels (stump holes or woody debris) that continue to burn.  Crews <br />
continue to evaluate and work on containment of lines on the northwest flank of Bonaparte Mountain.  The peat <br />
bog along Bonaparte Lake Road continue to burn and smolder, which can cause heavy smoke in the morning <br />
and evening hours.  This can drastically reduce visibility and it is recommended that alternate routes or residence <br />
avoid the area during these periods. <br />
<br />
Today, crews will continue to monitor and patrol lines throughout the day.  Repair crews are continuing to map <br />
almost 80 miles of suppression dozer line for repair throughout the fire.  Rehabilitation work is primarily along <br />
dozer lines that can impact water resources or on steep slopes, to reduce erosion and/or slope stability issues.  <br />
Crews continue to evaluate and find opportunities to create direct line, where safe for wildland firefighting crews, <br />
on the northwest flank of Bonaparte Mountain.<br />
<br />
Roads throughout the area remain closed as crews continue to remove fire weakened trees along roadways and <br />
heavy equipment (graders, excavators, dozers and others) work around the fire for rehabilitation work.  Please <br />
help keep everyone safe and adhere to the road closed signs. <br />
<br />
Evacuation levels have been reduced to level 1 throughout the area.</span>
