<br />
John Day, OR – Yesterday, fire crews were able to strengthen lines around the entire fire perimeter. Crews <br />
that were working a swing shift, are now working a full night shift to take advantage of lower temperatures and <br />
higher relative humidity.<br />
<br />
Fire activity on the eastside remained low and did not move outside containment lines. On the northwest side <br />
of the perimeter, interior islands of green burned throughout the day creating various plumes of smoke. During <br />
night shift, Hotshot crews and engines successfully completed a portion of burnout operations on the <br />
northwestern edge. These operations will slow down the forward progression of fire, giving firefighters a <br />
tactical advantage. Today, crews will continue to patrol and mop up around the entire perimeter while <br />
watching for spotting or slop over. Air operations will be available as needed and as weather allows. Night <br />
shift will continue burnout operations if conditions permit.  <br />
<br />
Cooler temperatures are expected today with a slight increase in humidity. Winds from the northwest will <br />
continue to be strong, ranging from 12 – 17 mph with gusts up to 28 mph in the exposed areas and aligned <br />
drainages. Smoke will be visible today as interior islands continue to burn and skies become clear in the <br />
afternoon.<br />
<br />
Closures:  <br />
<br />
Recreation Sites within the closure boundary: North Fork Malheur River Trailheads both north and south, <br />
North Fork Malheur Campground, Crane Crossing Trailheads both east and west, Short Creek Guard Station, <br />
Elk Creek Campground, Sunshine Flat Trailhead and Trail, Horseshoe Trailhead and Trail, Sheep Creek Trail <br />
and Trailhead, Little Crane Campground. <br />
<br />
Currently the Trout Farm and Crescent Campgrounds are still open to the public. <br />

<br />
Overview: Infra-red (IR) sensing technology mapping has shown that the Janus/Ridge and Kola Fires have <br />
merged. Moving forward we will be updating as one fire, the Bull Complex. Lower humidity, and wind gusts up <br />
to 15 mph across the ridge tops increased fire activity. A Type 2 initial attack helicopter, assigned from the <br />
Willamette National Forest, dropped water along the southern border to keep fire away from the cities of <br />
Detroit and Breitenbush, while monitoring for any areas of concern. <br />
<br />
Current Situation: Fire activity continued to be primarily in the north and northwest side of the fire. The fire <br />
entered the area of the 2010 Bull of the Woods Fire. High numbers of large dead trees and grassy fuels in the <br />
burn scar increased fire activity and created dangerous hazards for firefighters.   <br />
<br />
Afternoon winds out of the west and southwest shifted the fire to the northeast. A spot fire crossed the <br />
containment line outside of the wilderness along Forest Road 6370. Firefighters quickly established a <br />
containment line around the spot fire. Crews will be monitoring this spot while assessing the area for any <br />
additional spot fires.   <br />
<br />
Crews arranged hose lays along Forest Road 850 where Forest Road 6370 and Forest Road 4696 come <br />
together. This is to ensure water is available along containment lines to quickly extinguish any spot fires.   <br />
Weather: Cloud cover is expected in the morning with high temps in the mid-70s. West-northwest winds are to <br />
increase in the afternoon, with gusts up to 15 mph.   Smoke will continue to remain over the fire area and will <br />
be visible throughout the area. Affected communities should remain aware of smoke advisories and <br />
conditions. More information can be found at - www.airnow.gov or the Oregon Smoke Blog - <br />
https://oregonsmoke.blogspot.com/?m=1   Road Closures: Oregon Highway 224 is currently closed east of <br />
Promontory Park.    <br />
<br />
Area Closures:  Closure orders on National Forest System lands, roads, and trails within the Clackamas River <br />
Ranger District, Mt. Hood National Forest ORDER NO. 06-06-05-21-07. <br />
<br />
Forest closures are still in effect from the 2020 Beachie Creek and Lionshead Fires within the Willamette <br />
National Forest ORDER NO. 06-18-00-21-09.   Restrictions: Building, maintaining, attending, or using fire, <br />
campfire, or cooking fire, is prohibited throughout the Willamette National Forest ORDER NO. 06-18-00-21-16 <br />
and the Mt. Hood National Forest ORDER NO. 06-06-00-21-04.</span>

<br />
Bulldog Mountain Fire:  Yesterday firefighters observed moderate fire behavior and were successful in <br />
keeping the fire within established containment lines.  Helicopters were used early in the day to assist fire <br />
crews on the ground.  The fire was held west of FS Road 6110.  Heavy equipment were also successful <br />
constructing contingency lines in the Davis Lake and Deadman Creek areas.   <br />
<br />
Today firefighters will engage in direct fire attack in areas that are safe to do so.  Heavy equipment will be <br />
used to complete contingency lines in the Davis Lake and Deadman Creek areas.  Aircraft will be requested <br />
to assist if needed.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
The Bulldog Mountain Fire started August 5. 2021, located 20 miles north of Kettle Falls. The lightning caused <br />
fire spread quickly due to low relative humidity and unseasonably dry conditions.  The fire is burning in heavy <br />
timber and slash.  The fire is currently estimated at 4625 acres with 5% containment. <br />
 <br />
Mack Mountain Fire:  The Mack Mountain Fire started August 5, 2021 and is just south west of the Bulldog <br />
Mountain Fire.  The fire has grown and is estimated at approximately 1200 acres.  Residents in the Deadman <br />
Creek area will see smoke from the fire.  The fire area is located in steep, rugged terrain with limited access.  <br />
Firefighters will move heavy equipment into the area today to begin the difficult task of establishing indirect <br />
and contingency containment lines.<br />
<br />
Citizens should remain vigilant and are strongly encouraged to sign up for alerts at Ferry County Alerts.  <br />
Motorists traveling on the Boulder Hwy should watch for heavy equipment and firefighters turning off and onto <br />
the roadway.  There are 174 personnel assigned to the incident. There have been two minor injuries with no <br />
structures lost.  Firefighter and public safety is our number one priority.  <br />
<br />
Level 1 evacuation orders and road closures are in place. For current evacuation orders please see Ferry <br />
County Sheriff’s Office Facebook page.  Boulder Creek Hwy and State Route 395 remain open.  For <br />
information on area & road closures on the Colville National Forest please see <br />
https://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fseprd938379.pdf   Citizens are asked to stay clear of <br />
the fire area and adhere to road and area closures. <br />
<br />
Northeast Washington IMT 2 assumed command of the fire August 7th.  Fire information and the incident <br />
command post is located at Kettle Falls High School in Kettle Falls, WA. Fire information contact is Jeff <br />

Cedar Creek, Cub Creek 2 and Delancy Fires<br />
<br />
Daily Update<br />
<br />
August 17, 2021<br />
<br />
Winthrop, WA —The Cedar Creek, Cub Creek 2 and Delancy Fires are burning on the Okanogan-Wenatchee <br />
National Forest and public and private lands within Okanogan County.<br />
<br />
Fire Information Line: 509-557-0740 (8:00 am to 8:00 pm daily)<br />
<br />
Cedar Creek Fire: The fire has been mapped at 54,261 acres and reached. 50% containment.   Suppression <br />
efforts will focus on expected active fire activity in the Little Bridge Creek, South Fork Wolf Creek, Hubbard <br />
Creek, Silver Star Creek, Cedar Creek, Sheep Creek, Little Boulder Creek and Gardner Meadows.  In <br />
Division Juliet mop-up of direct line from Thompson Ridge to Roads 4415 and Helispot 15 will continue.  Mop-<br />
up operations will continue in the Vasaliki Ridge area.   Night shift crews secured and held line last night.<br />
<br />
Noticeably cooler and cloudy weather weakened the extreme fire weather conditions yesterday. Today will <br />
bring some breezy north and northwest wind to the region and a chance for showers and possibly an <br />
afternoon thunderstorm.  Showers don’t necessarily mean much precipitation.  It will however be the coolest <br />
day of this week with valleys struggling to reach 80 degrees.  Clouds will hang around in the early morning <br />
and afternoon hours.<br />
<br />
Cub Creek 2 Fire: The Cub Creek Fire is 69,678 acres and 65% contained. The fire has reached the lookout <br />
on Twenty Mile Peak as it grows further north. The lookout is still standing and firefighters will get in to inspect <br />
it when conditions are safe to do so. Along 8 Mile Rd., near the Honeymoon and Ruffed Grouse Campground <br />
crews are monitoring several spot fires where wind caused fire activity to pick up. The wind is blowing the fire <br />
back into itself. On the area of open line in the southern portion of the Cub Creek 2 Fire east of Ramsey Peak <br />
fire managers are keeping an eye on an area the grew out on Monday. Air resources will be used to work this <br />
flank.<br />
<br />
Delancy Fire:  The 223 acre Delancy Fire has not moved for several days and is 95% contained. No heat has <br />
been detected for the second day of Infrared flights.<br />
<br />
Fire Weather: Expect gusty west and northwest winds in the afternoon and evening.  Much cooler aire will <br />
move into the region today.  Temperatures in the mountains will be in the 70s and in the 80 in the valleys.  <br />
Smoke will be less prevalent as fresh breezes continue throughout the day.  <br />
<br />
Evacuations: The community of Mazama (west) remains in a Level 2 evacuation status.</span>

<br />
A Community Open house for the Walker and Chickadee fires was held last evening at the History Park <br />
Community Pool.  Fifty-four people attended the informative one and ½ hour session. <br />
<br />
Walker Creek Fire: Cooler temperatures and higher humidity moderated the fire behavior experienced on <br />
Sunday.   The fire still managed to increase by 2,552 acres on the southwest perimeter of the fire and west of <br />
Lost Lake. Once again aerial resources VLAT’s, retardant planes, Single Engine Air Tankers (SEAT’s) and <br />
heavy helicopters were used to assist firefighters and engine crews.  The fire has not reached Beaver <br />
Canyon.   <br />
<br />
Today’s activities include fireline construction from the southwest perimeter down to Highway 20, hot spotting <br />
west of Lost Lake, constructing indirect line with the heavy equipment on the northwest perimeter, connecting <br />
the northeast perimeter of the fire into a rock quarry on the Toroda road and gridding for hotspots in the Bunch <br />
road area.  Structure protection continues in the vicinity of the Bonaparte and Summer roads.   <br />
<br />
Chickadee Creek Fire:  Fire acreage remains the same from yesterday because an infrared mapping flight <br />
was not performed last evening. Fire officials report that that the fire did increase in size but not substantially.  <br />
Today’s activities include fireline preparation on the perimeter of the fire using existing roads, trails and natural <br />
features in anticipation of a future firing operation to remove the fuels between the main fire and firelines. <br />
<br />
Evacuations: Evacuations remain in place for several communities. Please refer to the Okanogan County, WA <br />

Cedar Creek, Cub Creek 2 and Delancy Fires<br />
<br />
Daily Update<br />
<br />
August 17, 2021<br />
<br />
Winthrop, WA —The Cedar Creek, Cub Creek 2 and Delancy Fires are burning on the Okanogan-Wenatchee <br />
National Forest and public and private lands within Okanogan County.<br />
<br />
Fire Information Line: 509-557-0740 (8:00 am to 8:00 pm daily)<br />
<br />
Cedar Creek Fire: The fire has been mapped at 54,261 acres and reached. 50% containment.   Suppression <br />
efforts will focus on expected active fire activity in the Little Bridge Creek, South Fork Wolf Creek, Hubbard <br />
Creek, Silver Star Creek, Cedar Creek, Sheep Creek, Little Boulder Creek and Gardner Meadows.  In <br />
Division Juliet mop-up of direct line from Thompson Ridge to Roads 4415 and Helispot 15 will continue.  Mop-<br />
up operations will continue in the Vasaliki Ridge area.   Night shift crews secured and held line last night.<br />
<br />
Noticeably cooler and cloudy weather weakened the extreme fire weather conditions yesterday. Today will <br />
bring some breezy north and northwest wind to the region and a chance for showers and possibly an <br />
afternoon thunderstorm.  Showers don’t necessarily mean much precipitation.  It will however be the coolest <br />
day of this week with valleys struggling to reach 80 degrees.  Clouds will hang around in the early morning <br />
and afternoon hours.<br />
<br />
Cub Creek 2 Fire: The Cub Creek Fire is 69,678 acres and 65% contained. The fire has reached the lookout <br />
on Twenty Mile Peak as it grows further north. The lookout is still standing and firefighters will get in to inspect <br />
it when conditions are safe to do so. Along 8 Mile Rd., near the Honeymoon and Ruffed Grouse Campground <br />
crews are monitoring several spot fires where wind caused fire activity to pick up. The wind is blowing the fire <br />
back into itself. On the area of open line in the southern portion of the Cub Creek 2 Fire east of Ramsey Peak <br />
fire managers are keeping an eye on an area the grew out on Monday. Air resources will be used to work this <br />
flank.<br />
<br />
Delancy Fire:  The 223 acre Delancy Fire has not moved for several days and is 95% contained. No heat has <br />
been detected for the second day of Infrared flights.<br />
<br />
Fire Weather: Expect gusty west and northwest winds in the afternoon and evening.  Much cooler aire will <br />
move into the region today.  Temperatures in the mountains will be in the 70s and in the 80 in the valleys.  <br />
Smoke will be less prevalent as fresh breezes continue throughout the day.  <br />
<br />
Evacuations: The community of Mazama (west) remains in a Level 2 evacuation status.</span>

Devil’s Knob Complex Morning Update <br />
<br />
Northwest Incident Management Team 8, Incident Commander, Kevin Stock <br />
<br />
August 17, 2021 <br />
<br />
The Devil's Knob Complex is a group of lightning-caused fires with the majority burning on the Tiller Ranger <br />
District, Umpqua National Forest and on private lands protected by Douglas Forest Protective Association. <br />
The Devil’s Knob Complex is situated between the Rough Patch Complex and Jack Fire to the north, which is <br />
being managed by Great Basin Team 2 and the Skyline Ridge Complex to the southwest, which is being <br />
managed by Oregon Department of Forestry Team 1. The Devil's Knob Complex is managed by Northwest <br />
Incident Management Team 8 from an incident command post at the Milo Academy near Tiller, Oregon.  <br />
<br />
Great Basin Team 2 will assume command of the Devil's Knob Complex on Wednesday, August 18 at 6 AM.  <br />
Preparations for transfer of command are underway.  <br />
<br />

Complex Total Acreage: 13,697 <br />
<br />
Complex Total Containment: 15% <br />
<br />
General Updates:  Fire behavior increased significantly yesterday on two of the larger fires in the Complex – <br />
Smith and Big Hamlin Fires.  Fires were impacted by the combined effects of full sun under clear skies, <br />
gusting west winds and low relative humidity coming into alignment during the peak afternoon burn window <br />
(see more details in the fire summary below). Meadow Spike Camp will be dismantled and all resources will <br />
be returning to the main camp at the incident command post today. The total number of active fires on the <br />
Complex has now been reduced to 11 as a result of containment and control efforts and the merging of larger <br />
fires. <br />
<br />
The following is a summary of the significant fire activity over the fire complex starting from north to south: <br />
<br />
Smith Fire – 1,369 acres – the fire made a significant run yesterday afternoon to the southeast. Much of the <br />
fire is still holding on Dumont Creek Road on the north and was pushed by west winds down to the South <br />
Umpqua River and spotted across to the east side of the river.   <br />
<br />
Mule Creek Fire – 1,024 acres – all containment lines held the fire in its current footprint; mop up operations <br />
continue. <br />
<br />
Big Hamlin Fire – 9,725 acres – the fire made a significant run yesterday to the southeast and moved across <br />
the indirect containment lines on the south and southeast flanks towards the Roque-Umpqua Divide. The fire <br />
stayed within the indirect containment line to the east. <br />
<br />
Little Applegate Fire – 135 acres –contained and in patrol status.   <br />
<br />
Wild Cat Fire – 215 acres – fire behavior was minimal, mop up operations continue. An unstaffed sprinkler <br />
system along the east flank of the fire continues to be effective and will continue to be operated in areas too <br />
hazardous for firefighters. <br />
<br />
Section 30 (Railroad) Fire – 76 acres – contained and in patrol status; no smokes. <br />
<br />
Dismal Creek (444) Fire – 40 acres – contained and in patrol status; no smokes. <br />
<br />
The firefighting resources on the Devil's Knob Complex are also responsible for conducting initial attack <br />
operations on the entire Tiller Ranger District and private land holdings. Firefighters are prepared to respond <br />
to any initial fire starts.</span>

8/17/2021<br />
<br />
Yesterday, the fire progressed northeast to north, moving into the Five Sister’s Mountain area, backing down <br />
towards to Bittrich-Antler, Casberg-Burroughs, and Redman.  Dozer line in conjunction with disking of fields <br />
were created to try and hold the fire line at that area.  <br />
<br />
At around 8pm last night, the winds shifted, coming out  of the north, which pushed the southern edge of the <br />
fire into Scott’s Valley area, moving the fire front to the southwest.  <br />
<br />
New level 3 evacuations were given in the area between Tumtum and Ford, along Highway 291 to Corkscrew <br />
Canyon Road.  Crews were able to get portions of dozer line along the south edge of the fire.  <br />
<br />
Crews were able to get dozer line from Ford to Rail Canyon Road and hold the fire within that area.  The fire <br />
expanded in the Rail Canyon area and crews worked primarily on structure protection in this area as the fire <br />
progressed. <br />
<br />
Today, crews will work on connecting the dozer line on the fire front between Ford and Tumtum as <br />
well as holding the fireline west of Scott’s Valley Road.  Crews will continue to work north along 231 <br />
constructing dozer line on the western flank of the fire.  Engines will continue to prepare and conduct structure <br />
protection where the flame front is moving through. Cooler weather and higher humidity is expected in the <br />
area with a chance of rain.<br />
<br />
Southwest Area Incident Management Team 5 (Type 2 Team) will begin to arrive today. They are anticipated <br />
to take command of the fire at 6:00am on 8/18/2021</span>

<br />
Lakeview, OR – Favorable conditions overnight allowed crews to strengthen contingency lines around the <br />
perimeter of the Patton Meadow Fire in anticipation of today’s Red Flag Warning.<br />
Efforts were focused on controlling the fire on the west and south fronts to prevent further spread, with Patton <br />
Meadow Road providing a perimeter on the west side and Highway 140 to the south. Control lines along <br />
Highway 140 are plumbed and crews have begun mopping up on the section of the fire south of Highway 140. <br />
Along Patton Meadow Road, hose lays are increasing. With winds calmer than expected overnight, crews <br />
were also able to direct resources to clearing brush and continuing to strengthen control lines on the east side <br />
of the fire in preparation for today’s forecasted winds.<br />
<br />
Today’s forecasted Red Flag Warning from 2pm to 10pm will bring a dry cold front through the region with <br />
winds from the north and northwest at 15mph and gusts up to 35mph. The conditions will complicate <br />
firefighting efforts and have potential to push the fire to the south and east. Additional resources are being <br />
added to the firefighting effort and crews will be focusing on fortifying control and contingency lines in <br />
anticipation of the winds increasing in the early afternoon.<br />
<br />
In anticipation of today’s weather event, two additional OSFM task forces are arriving to assist with structure <br />
protection. One task force will be arriving from Yamhill County and a Clackamas County task force will be <br />
coming in from the Middle Fork Complex. OSFM task forces are assessing homes and working with wildland <br />
crews to fortify containment lines along the south, east, and west sides of the fire.<br />
<br />
The overnight infrared flight showed Patton Meadow at 6,405 and Willow Valley at 824 acres. The fires are 23 <br />
percent and 57 percent contained respectively.<br />

<br />
Fireline on the Northern Perimeter Holds Against Gusty Winds<br />
<br />
Current Situation: Green Ridge Fire: The Green Ridge Fire is currently 37,599 acres and is 19% contained. <br />
The last 48 hours have tested fire lines in Division M, on the 22 (4022) Road, with gusty southwest winds. <br />
Those lines held and Division M remains in the same footprint as before the increased winds over the last few <br />
days, demonstrating the effectiveness of the firing operation and fire line in place on the 22 (4022) Road. <br />
Yesterday, the north side of the fire saw minimal activity in Divisions K and M, spanning from the Kendall <br />
Skyline Road to the existing containment line on the north end of the Lick Creek Fire scar. The Green Ridge <br />
Fire continued to move slightly to the south in Division W, extending just south of Oregon Butte. The majority <br />
of the fire’s growth yesterday was on the southern perimeter where unburned pockets of fuel burned between <br />
previously burned areas in Division S.<br />
<br />
The fire is expected to continue burning southward today consuming unburned pockets of fuel along the fire’s <br />
southern perimeter in divisions W and P. With the fire line successfully holding in divisions M and K through <br />
the wind event over the last 48 hours, a number of firefighting resources will be strategically transitioned to <br />
the southern perimeter of the fire. There will still be firefighters in place in divisions K and M on the northern <br />
and western fire lines in to patrol and engage any existing pockets of heat. Indirect line construction will begin <br />
in Division P today to the south of the Lick Creek Fire scar. Heavy equipment is expected on the roads today <br />
with the transition of firefighting resources from Branch I to Branch II.<br />
<br />
Current Situation: Lick Creek Fire: The Lick Creek fire remains 80,421 acres and 97% contained. The <br />
uncontained 3% of fire line is east of Misery Springs campground on West Mountain Road. Torching and <br />
smoldering within the interior of the fire perimeter is expected to continue as the fire continues to burn <br />
unburned pockets of fuel from within the fire’s perimeter. Firefighters will continue to mop up along the fire’s <br />
perimeter and monitor containment lines.<br />
<br />
Weather & Smoke Information: The cooling trend is expected to continue today, which will be accompanied by <br />
moderate northwest winds. These gusty winds are expected to help with smoke dispersion across the area. <br />
West-southwest winds are expected to be 7-14 mph, with gusts to 20 mph. Temperatures will be 60-65 <br />
degrees along the ridges and 68-73 degrees in the valley bottoms. Smoke information is available on <br />
Washington Smoke Blog at: https://wasmoke.blogspot.com/<br />
<br />
Forest Closures: Closures are in place on the Umatilla National Forest. The forest closure for some areas on <br />
the Umatilla NF have been amended. The amended order reopened most Umatilla NF lands in Oregon. The <br />
order also closed all lands on the Walla Walla Ranger District in Washington; forest lands in the Pomeroy <br />
Ranger District remain closed to entry. the closure order is available at https://go.usa.gov/xFyhn.<br />
<br />
Evacuations: Garfield County currently has Level 1, 2 and 3 evacuations in place. Columbia County currently <br />
has Level 3, Level 2, and Level 1 evacuations in place. The Grouse Flats area is currently under a Level 1 <br />
evacuation in Garfield County, Asotin County, and Wallowa County, Oregon. An interactive fire map that <br />
shows evacuations and other important information is available at https://tinyurl.com/yv2sypd4.<br />
<br />
Temporary Flight Restrictions: A Temporary Flight Restriction is in place over the Green Ridge Fire and Lick <br />
Creek Fire. Wildfires are a No Drone Zone. If you fly, we can’t. Whenever a drone is spotted near the fire all <br />
aircraft are grounded until we can be sure the drone is clear of the area. For more information, visit <br />

<br />
Overall Objective The Rough Complex and Jack Fire area being managed under a full suppression strategy <br />
using containment and confinement tactics to minimize fire spread to prevent loss of high value resources and <br />
other values at risk.  Leaders’ intent is to not allow the fire to progress to the west by using the PACE model – <br />
Primary, Alternate, Contingency and Emergency control Lines and to keep the fires as small as possible while <br />
working toward full containment. <br />
<br />
Closures:  The Umpqua and Willamette National Forests have updated existing closure orders to encompass <br />
the Rough Patch, Jack, Archie Creek and Devil's Knob Fire Areas. This includes Canton Creek Campground, <br />
Musick Guard Station and Cover Campground.     <br />
<br />
Roseburg District Bureau of Land Management has expanded its closure area to include the Scaredman <br />
Recreation Site. Francis Creek Road from the junction with Canton Creek Road north to the district boundary <br />
has been closed since August 5.   <br />
<br />
Highway 138 between Roseburg and Diamond Lake and Crater Lake remains open.  Slow down and be alert <br />
while passing through the fire area.  <br />
<br />
Chaos and Little Bend Fires:  The primary containment lines of these fires lay on the west and northwest <br />
flanks.  Direct fire line construction and indirect fire lines with burnout operations are occurring in these areas <br />
of the fire. On the west and south flanks of these fire the primary containment lines are at the perimeter of the <br />
fire and heavy equipment is working to construct and reinforce alternate and contingency lines.  These two <br />
fires are at 0% containment, but progress is being made. <br />
<br />
Jack Fire:  The Jack Fire does have containment lines that are holding on the west and north flanks of the <br />
fires.  Fire crews are patrolling these flanks and taking action to hold the lines as necessary.  The southwest <br />
and south flanks of the fire is seeing active fire behavior – tactics on these flanks include direct dozer line, the <br />
construction of primary and alternate lines using the road system and building and reinforcing contingency <br />
lines along the 27 and 2715 roads. <br />
<br />
Buckhead and Near Minky Fires:  These fires lay south of the Jack fire and have similar active fire behavior <br />
on the west flanks.  The contingency line being constructed with heavy equipment for the Jack fire will extend <br />
to the south and act as the primary holding line to prevent these fires from moving to the west.  On the south <br />
and east flanks of these fire, heavy equipment is working to build fire line to hold and prevent fire from <br />
escaping to the south and east.</span>

Middle Fork Complex Fire Update – Tuesday, August 17, 2021 – 9:00 am <br />
<br />
Clear skies on Monday allowed aviation resources to support crews on the Kwis, Gales and Ninemile Fires as <br />
they checked fire spread with bucket drops and performed reconnaissance flights. <br />
<br />
Kwis Fire: The Kwis Fire is 51% contained and has stayed within its footprint for the past few days. <br />
Yesterday’s clear skies afforded an opportunity to get in and take a closer look to identify areas of heat within <br />
the fire perimeter. There was some active burning inside the fire perimeter. Firefighters have completed the <br />
alternate fire line along Forest Road 5871 and those resources are being repositioned to work on constructing <br />
and preparing fire line to the southeast of the Gales Fire. Crews remain vigilant as they systematically search <br />
for areas of heat that could pose a threat to containment lines and extinguish or remove any burning material. <br />
Hazardous trees along roadways are being identified and felled. <br />
<br />
Gales and Ninemile Fires:  Burnout operations on the west end of the fire were aided by favorable winds. <br />
Crews are working down toward the Rumble Creek Drainage as they tie in to Forest Road 18.  Slope <br />
alignment, burning moss, lichen and wind were all factors in the spot fire that contributed to Gales Fire’s <br />
northeast spread into the Falls Creek drainage yesterday. The smoke column generated as the fire <br />
established in heavy fuels was visible to many people in Lane County. Today, firefighters will assess access to <br />
Forest Road 1832 and capitalize on any opportunities to safely re-engage in that area to tie containment line <br />
back in to Road 18. Crews and heavy equipment are continuing preparation of containment lines along key <br />
road systems today.  <br />
<br />
Weather & Smoke: Humidity recovery overnight and cooler temperatures today are expected to be favorable <br />
for firefighting efforts. The small amount of rain overnight was not enough to penetrate the tree canopy.  It <br />
would take several days of wetting rain to make an appreciable difference in fuel moisture. <br />
<br />
Structure Protection: Yesterday Oregon State Fire Marshal Task Force firefighters triaged the US Forest <br />
Service Clark Creek Organizational Camp, a historic group campground constructed during the 1930s. Fire-<br />
resistant structure wrap was used to protect 10 structures, including a large picnic gazebo. Wrap is intended <br />
to protect structures from embers or heat and decrease the risk of fire ignition.  <br />
<br />
Today, Clackamas County Task Forces are shifting south to the Patton Meadow Fire in Klamath and Lake <br />
Counties. The Linn County Task Force will return to their home agencies and Unified Command with Incident <br />
Management Team Pacific Northwest Team 3 (PNW 3) was concluded with all authority passed to Team <br />
PNW3. Fire suppression authority was also released back to local jurisdictions. <br />
<br />
Evacuations: Level 1 and 3 evacuation notices have been issued by Lane County. A previous Level 2 <br />
evacuation for Oakridge, OR, was reduced yesterday to a Level 1. For current evacuation information and an <br />
interactive map of evacuation areas, visit: www.lanecounty.org.  <br />
<br />
Closures: Some National Forest System lands near the Middle Fork Complex are temporarily closed to <br />
provide for public safety. For more information, visit www.fs.usda.gov/willamette.  <br />

<br />
Fireline on the Northern Perimeter Holds Against Gusty Winds<br />
 <br />
Current Situation: Green Ridge Fire: The Green Ridge Fire is currently 37,599 acres and is 19% contained. <br />
The last 48 hours have tested fire lines in Division M, on the 22 (4022) Road, with gusty southwest winds. <br />
Those lines held and Division M remains in the same footprint as before the increased winds over the last few <br />
days, demonstrating the effectiveness of the firing operation and fire line in place on the 22 (4022) Road. <br />
Yesterday, the north side of the fire saw minimal activity in Divisions K and M, spanning from the Kendall <br />
Skyline Road to the existing containment line on the north end of the Lick Creek Fire scar. The Green Ridge <br />
Fire continued to move slightly to the south in Division W, extending just south of Oregon Butte. The majority <br />
of the fire’s growth yesterday was on the southern perimeter where unburned pockets of fuel burned between <br />
previously burned areas in Division S.<br />
<br />
The fire is expected to continue burning southward today consuming unburned pockets of fuel along the fire’s <br />
southern perimeter in divisions W and P. With the fire line successfully holding in divisions M and K through <br />
the wind event over the last 48 hours, a number of firefighting resources will be strategically transitioned to <br />
the southern perimeter of the fire. There will still be firefighters in place in divisions K and M on the northern <br />
and western fire lines in to patrol and engage any existing pockets of heat. Indirect line construction will begin <br />
in Division P today to the south of the Lick Creek Fire scar. Heavy equipment is expected on the roads today <br />
with the transition of firefighting resources from Branch I to Branch II.<br />
<br />
Current Situation: Lick Creek Fire: The Lick Creek fire remains 80,421 acres and 97% contained. The <br />
uncontained 3% of fire line is east of Misery Springs campground on West Mountain Road. Torching and <br />
smoldering within the interior of the fire perimeter is expected to continue as the fire continues to burn <br />
unburned pockets of fuel from within the fire’s perimeter. Firefighters will continue to mop up along the fire’s <br />
perimeter and monitor containment lines.<br />
<br />
Weather & Smoke Information: The cooling trend is expected to continue today, which will be accompanied by <br />
moderate northwest winds. These gusty winds are expected to help with smoke dispersion across the area. <br />
West-southwest winds are expected to be 7-14 mph, with gusts to 20 mph. Temperatures will be 60-65 <br />
degrees along the ridges and 68-73 degrees in the valley bottoms. Smoke information is available on <br />
Washington Smoke Blog at: https://wasmoke.blogspot.com/<br />
<br />
Forest Closures: Closures are in place on the Umatilla National Forest. The forest closure for some areas on <br />
the Umatilla NF have been amended. The amended order reopened most Umatilla NF lands in Oregon. The <br />
order also closed all lands on the Walla Walla Ranger District in Washington; forest lands in the Pomeroy <br />
Ranger District remain closed to entry. the closure order is available at https://go.usa.gov/xFyhn.<br />
<br />
Evacuations: Garfield County currently has Level 1, 2 and 3 evacuations in place. Columbia County currently <br />
has Level 3, Level 2, and Level 1 evacuations in place. The Grouse Flats area is currently under a Level 1 <br />
evacuation in Garfield County, Asotin County, and Wallowa County, Oregon. An interactive fire map that <br />
shows evacuations and other important information is available at https://tinyurl.com/yv2sypd4.<br />
<br />
Temporary Flight Restrictions: A Temporary Flight Restriction is in place over the Green Ridge Fire and Lick <br />
Creek Fire. Wildfires are a No Drone Zone. If you fly, we can’t. Whenever a drone is spotted near the fire all <br />
aircraft are grounded until we can be sure the drone is clear of the area. For more information, visit <br />

<br />
Bulldog Mountain Fire:  Yesterday firefighters observed moderate fire behavior and were successful in <br />
keeping the fire within established containment lines.  Helicopters were used early in the day to assist fire <br />
crews on the ground.  The fire was held west of FS Road 6110.  Heavy equipment were also successful <br />
constructing contingency lines in the Davis Lake and Deadman Creek areas.   <br />
<br />
Today firefighters will engage in direct fire attack in areas that are safe to do so.  Heavy equipment will be <br />
used to complete contingency lines in the Davis Lake and Deadman Creek areas.  Aircraft will be requested <br />
to assist if needed.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
The Bulldog Mountain Fire started August 5. 2021, located 20 miles north of Kettle Falls. The lightning caused <br />
fire spread quickly due to low relative humidity and unseasonably dry conditions.  The fire is burning in heavy <br />
timber and slash.  The fire is currently estimated at 4625 acres with 5% containment. <br />
 <br />
Mack Mountain Fire:  The Mack Mountain Fire started August 5, 2021 and is just south west of the Bulldog <br />
Mountain Fire.  The fire has grown and is estimated at approximately 1200 acres.  Residents in the Deadman <br />
Creek area will see smoke from the fire.  The fire area is located in steep, rugged terrain with limited access.  <br />
Firefighters will move heavy equipment into the area today to begin the difficult task of establishing indirect <br />
and contingency containment lines.<br />
<br />
Citizens should remain vigilant and are strongly encouraged to sign up for alerts at Ferry County Alerts.  <br />
Motorists traveling on the Boulder Hwy should watch for heavy equipment and firefighters turning off and onto <br />
the roadway.  There are 174 personnel assigned to the incident. There have been two minor injuries with no <br />
structures lost.  Firefighter and public safety is our number one priority.  <br />
<br />
Level 1 evacuation orders and road closures are in place. For current evacuation orders please see Ferry <br />
County Sheriff’s Office Facebook page.  Boulder Creek Hwy and State Route 395 remain open.  For <br />
information on area & road closures on the Colville National Forest please see <br />
https://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fseprd938379.pdf   Citizens are asked to stay clear of <br />
the fire area and adhere to road and area closures. <br />
<br />
Northeast Washington IMT 2 assumed command of the fire August 7th.  Fire information and the incident <br />
command post is located at Kettle Falls High School in Kettle Falls, WA. Fire information contact is Jeff <br />

Middle Fork Complex Fire Update – Tuesday, August 17, 2021 – 9:00 am <br />
<br />
Clear skies on Monday allowed aviation resources to support crews on the Kwis, Gales and Ninemile Fires as <br />
they checked fire spread with bucket drops and performed reconnaissance flights. <br />
<br />
Kwis Fire: The Kwis Fire is 51% contained and has stayed within its footprint for the past few days. <br />
Yesterday’s clear skies afforded an opportunity to get in and take a closer look to identify areas of heat within <br />
the fire perimeter. There was some active burning inside the fire perimeter. Firefighters have completed the <br />
alternate fire line along Forest Road 5871 and those resources are being repositioned to work on constructing <br />
and preparing fire line to the southeast of the Gales Fire. Crews remain vigilant as they systematically search <br />
for areas of heat that could pose a threat to containment lines and extinguish or remove any burning material. <br />
Hazardous trees along roadways are being identified and felled. <br />
<br />
Gales and Ninemile Fires:  Burnout operations on the west end of the fire were aided by favorable winds. <br />
Crews are working down toward the Rumble Creek Drainage as they tie in to Forest Road 18.  Slope <br />
alignment, burning moss, lichen and wind were all factors in the spot fire that contributed to Gales Fire’s <br />
northeast spread into the Falls Creek drainage yesterday. The smoke column generated as the fire <br />
established in heavy fuels was visible to many people in Lane County. Today, firefighters will assess access to <br />
Forest Road 1832 and capitalize on any opportunities to safely re-engage in that area to tie containment line <br />
back in to Road 18. Crews and heavy equipment are continuing preparation of containment lines along key <br />
road systems today.  <br />
<br />
Weather & Smoke: Humidity recovery overnight and cooler temperatures today are expected to be favorable <br />
for firefighting efforts. The small amount of rain overnight was not enough to penetrate the tree canopy.  It <br />
would take several days of wetting rain to make an appreciable difference in fuel moisture. <br />
<br />
Structure Protection: Yesterday Oregon State Fire Marshal Task Force firefighters triaged the US Forest <br />
Service Clark Creek Organizational Camp, a historic group campground constructed during the 1930s. Fire-<br />
resistant structure wrap was used to protect 10 structures, including a large picnic gazebo. Wrap is intended <br />
to protect structures from embers or heat and decrease the risk of fire ignition.  <br />
<br />
Today, Clackamas County Task Forces are shifting south to the Patton Meadow Fire in Klamath and Lake <br />
Counties. The Linn County Task Force will return to their home agencies and Unified Command with Incident <br />
Management Team Pacific Northwest Team 3 (PNW 3) was concluded with all authority passed to Team <br />
PNW3. Fire suppression authority was also released back to local jurisdictions. <br />
<br />
Evacuations: Level 1 and 3 evacuation notices have been issued by Lane County. A previous Level 2 <br />
evacuation for Oakridge, OR, was reduced yesterday to a Level 1. For current evacuation information and an <br />
interactive map of evacuation areas, visit: www.lanecounty.org.  <br />
<br />
Closures: Some National Forest System lands near the Middle Fork Complex are temporarily closed to <br />
provide for public safety. For more information, visit www.fs.usda.gov/willamette.  <br />

A virtual community meeting will be held today at 6:30 pm. To attend navigate to<br />

Current Situation: Yesterday the Muckamuck fire remained active. A low pressure system passing<br />
through North Central Washington brought gusty winds to the fire area. Fire ran through the crowns of<br />
trees on the ridges where the winds were the strongest and the fire spread to the east. Firefighters<br />
remained in Conconully to build on the strong work following Sunday night’s battle after the fire ran 4 ½<br />
miles into the community. Roughly 3 miles of line were fired Monday on the southwest portion of the<br />
fire near Mineral Hill to strengthen dozer lines constructed over the last few days. No homes have been<br />
destroyed but the threat to the 387 homes in the area will remain until the established lines along the<br />
fire’s edge can be controlled around and above Conconully.<br />
Today winds will shift to north and northwest and temperatures will cool. Fire behavior will remain<br />
active. The winds may help the effort by slowing the fire’s growth to the north. Plans for the day are to<br />
mop up the area fired above Mineral Hill and to bolster additional lines to protect Conconully.<br />
Residents in areas nearby or east of the fire are encouraged to sign up for emergency alerts through<br />
Okanogan County Emergency Management.<br />
Weather: Today will be the coolest day of the week with temperatures in the high 70s to low 80s. There<br />
is a slight chance of showers and afternoon thunderstorms.<br />

<br />
Overall Objective The Rough Complex and Jack Fire area being managed under a full suppression strategy <br />
using containment and confinement tactics to minimize fire spread to prevent loss of high value resources and <br />
other values at risk.  Leaders’ intent is to not allow the fire to progress to the west by using the PACE model – <br />
Primary, Alternate, Contingency and Emergency control Lines and to keep the fires as small as possible while <br />
working toward full containment. <br />
<br />
Closures:  The Umpqua and Willamette National Forests have updated existing closure orders to encompass <br />
the Rough Patch, Jack, Archie Creek and Devil's Knob Fire Areas. This includes Canton Creek Campground, <br />
Musick Guard Station and Cover Campground.     <br />
<br />
Roseburg District Bureau of Land Management has expanded its closure area to include the Scaredman <br />
Recreation Site. Francis Creek Road from the junction with Canton Creek Road north to the district boundary <br />
has been closed since August 5.   <br />
<br />
Highway 138 between Roseburg and Diamond Lake and Crater Lake remains open.  Slow down and be alert <br />
while passing through the fire area.  <br />
<br />
Chaos and Little Bend Fires:  The primary containment lines of these fires lay on the west and northwest <br />
flanks.  Direct fire line construction and indirect fire lines with burnout operations are occurring in these areas <br />
of the fire. On the west and south flanks of these fire the primary containment lines are at the perimeter of the <br />
fire and heavy equipment is working to construct and reinforce alternate and contingency lines.  These two <br />
fires are at 0% containment, but progress is being made. <br />
<br />
Jack Fire:  The Jack Fire does have containment lines that are holding on the west and north flanks of the <br />
fires.  Fire crews are patrolling these flanks and taking action to hold the lines as necessary.  The southwest <br />
and south flanks of the fire is seeing active fire behavior – tactics on these flanks include direct dozer line, the <br />
construction of primary and alternate lines using the road system and building and reinforcing contingency <br />
lines along the 27 and 2715 roads. <br />
<br />
Buckhead and Near Minky Fires:  These fires lay south of the Jack fire and have similar active fire behavior <br />
on the west flanks.  The contingency line being constructed with heavy equipment for the Jack fire will extend <br />
to the south and act as the primary holding line to prevent these fires from moving to the west.  On the south <br />
and east flanks of these fire, heavy equipment is working to build fire line to hold and prevent fire from <br />
escaping to the south and east.</span>

Yesterday: Strong, gusty north and west winds led to extreme fire behavior. This resulted in several areas of <br />
spotting across control lines on the northeast side of the fire, west of Hwy 410. A Level 3 evacuation order <br />
was issued at 3:30 PM for areas along Hwy 410 from Rock Creek Road to Little Naches Road. When the <br />
evacuation orders were issued, fire crews went into structure protection mode, engaging pumps and sprinkler <br />
systems to protect structures. The fire was active on all fronts with most of the activity on the north and east <br />
sides. On Bumping River Road, the fire reached the River and a small fire spotted across the river, but crews <br />
held it between the river and the road.<br />
Today: Cooler weather and higher humidity will be beneficial for fire activity today and will provide fire <br />
managers a chance to assess the fire spread from yesterday. Crews are actively working along the Highway <br />
410 corridor and Bumping River Road, and in the interior where additional fire lines are being developed or <br />
strengthened. Air assets in the form of federally-operated drones will confirm fire spread, and aircraft will fly as <br />
resources are available and weather conditions permit. The southeast corner at Rattlesnake Springs drainage <br />
is currently holding well, as are containment measures along Bumping River Road and the Goose Prairie <br />
community. Evaluation for pump systems and sprinkler systems will continue, and adjustments will be made <br />
where necessary. Resources are continuing to arrive by the hour. A Red Cross shelter has been established <br />
at Summit View Church of Christ, 100 North 72nd Avenue in Yakima.<br />
Evacuations: A LEVEL 3 evacuation order has been issued from Rock Creek Road to Little Naches Road <br />
along Hwy 410.  Bumping River Road and drainage remains at a LEVEL 3 evacuation.  This means if you live <br />
in either of these two LEVEL 3 areas, you need to GO NOW and evacuate.  Additionally, Hwy 410 from Eagle <br />
Rock north to Rock Creek Rd and from Little Naches Road west to Bumping River Road is currently in a <br />
LEVEL 2. Those living in these LEVEL 2 areas need to BE SET and prepared for potential evacuation. Check <br />
with Yakima County Office of Emergency Management for updates on evacuation information. Residents and <br />
visitors are encouraged to sign up for emergency alerts through Yakima County: yakimacounty.us/2222/Alert-<br />

CANYONVILLE, Ore. - Yesterday morning the skies were much clearer on the Skyline Ridge Complex than <br />
they've been lately. The smoke inversion that has covered the area most mornings lifted overnight, and winds <br />
increased.<br />
Gusty winds from the west buffeted the fires much of the day. Many small pockets of residual vegetation <br />
flared up on Poole Creek Fire. Firefighters closely monitored this increased fire activity and took action as <br />
needed to keep the fire inside control lines. Poole Creek Fire and the other smaller fires on the Complex <br />
stayed within their lines.<br />
Overnight moist, cooler air moved into the fire area. Drizzle to light rain fell on the fires, with showers <br />
expected to continue through this morning. While the moisture isn’t enough to put out the fire, it will be <br />
enough to make fine fuels like grasses and brush temporarily too wet to burn. Firefighters will be able to break <br />
open hot areas and let the damp air and surface soil cool them, which will quicken mop up.<br />
When skies clear this afternoon, fire activity is expected to increase with continuing gusty winds. It's safer if <br />
this “wind-testing” of a fire occurs while a fire is well-staffed, like the Skyline Ridge Complex. Burning <br />
remaining fuels now makes the fires less likely to flare up later in the summer.<br />
Surplus personnel and equipment are being released from the Skyline Ridge Complex. Most of these will be <br />
going home to get some rest before their next assignment, or they will head directly to another fire.<br />
The Douglas County Sheriff's Office has reduced the evacuation area and level for Upper Cow Creek Road. <br />
To get the most up to date information visit https://www.dcso.com/evacuations. The Level 1 (Be Ready) <br />
evacuation order remains in place on Moore Ranch Rd. and Ferguson Lane.</span>

<br />
I Inchelium, WA – The Summit Trail Fire was started by lightning on July 12, and is burning on the Colville <br />
Reservation approximately 17 miles west of Inchelium.  The Upper Lime Creek Fire was also burning on the <br />
Colville Reservation approximately 6 miles north of Keller. The 376-acre fire is 75 percent contained. <br />
Northwest Incident Management Team 10 has been managing both the Upper Lime Creek Fire and the <br />
Summit Trail Fire with 421 personnel engaged in fighting the fires in terrain that is steep, rough and often <br />
difficult to access.<br />
<br />
Southwesterly winds from Sunday and overnight into early Monday carried embers that ignited large spot fires <br />
on Brush and Tungsten Mountains. Winds pushed the Summit Trail Fire to the northeast, east and southeast.  <br />
Using ground and air reconnaissance, fire managers were able to determine the extent of the perimeter’s <br />
growth.<br />
<br />
Due to this fire growth, Colville Tribal Police issued additional Level 2 and Level 3 evacuation notices (see <br />
below). Fire crews, heavy equipment and air support engaged in structure protection in the newly affected <br />
areas. Firefighters on the south edge and southwest flank of the fire continued to build, connect and reinforce <br />
lines while crews on the west side successfully checked a fire that had moved across the containment lines.    <br />
<br />
Weather conditions are expected to moderate as a cold front enters the region. Rainfall is a possibility, but <br />
accumulations are forecast to be slight. Cooler temperatures and increased relative humidity could result in <br />
less active fire behavior.<br />
<br />
Today, firefighters will continue structure protection, reinforce existing lines around the fire’s edges and look <br />
for favorable areas to build containment lines. Priorities include protecting homes at Barnaby Creek through <br />
containment of the fire burning on Brush Mountain, and limiting fire spread from the southeast flank toward <br />
the Twin Lakes area. This will be the last daily update to include the Upper Lime Creek Fire; responsibility for <br />
this fireis scheduled to return to Mt. Tolman Fire Center (MTFC) today. For further information about the Upper <br />
Lime Creek Fire, contact MTFC at (509) 634-3100.<br />
<br />

The Twentyfive Mile Fire was first reported at 3:45 p.m. on August 15, 2021 and is burning on the south shore <br />
of Lake Chelan near Twentyfive Mile Creek. The fire is under joint jurisdiction of the Okanogan-Wenatchee <br />
National Forest, Washington Department of Natural Resources and Chelan County Fire District 7.<br />
<br />
A Type 3 Incident Management Team led by Incident Commander Escobar took command of the firefighting <br />
response at 6:00 a.m. August 16. Additional resources are continuing to arrive. A Type 1 Incident <br />
Management Team has been ordered and is expected to arrive this week.<br />
  <br />
The fire continues to burn in timber, brush and grass. The fire size is estimated at 4262 acres. Crews staffed <br />
the fire overnight and continued to reinforce structure protection lines. Today crews will work on constructing <br />
and reinforcing new containment lines.<br />
<br />
Air resources will continue attack on the fire throughout the day. Aircraft may use local bodies of water, <br />
including Lake Chelan, to fill. Recreational boaters should be aware of aircraft takeoff and landings and keep <br />
a safe distance.<br />
 <br />
Evacuations: The most up-to-date evacuation information is available through Chelan County Emergency <br />
Management at the following links. Current evacuation levels remained in place overnight and will continue <br />

<br />
Inchelium, WA – The Summit Trail Fire was started by lightning on July 12, and is burning on the Colville <br />
Reservation approximately 17 miles west of Inchelium.  The Upper Lime Creek Fire was also burning on the <br />
Colville Reservation approximately 6 miles north of Keller. The 376-acre fire is 75 percent contained. <br />
Northwest Incident Management Team 10 has been managing both the Upper Lime Creek Fire and the <br />
Summit Trail Firewith 421 personnel engaged in fighting the fires in terrain that is steep, rough and often <br />
difficult to access.<br />
<br />
Southwesterly winds from Sunday and overnight into early Monday carried embers that ignited large spot fires <br />
on Brush and Tungsten Mountains. Winds pushed the Summit Trail Fireto the northeast, east and southeast.  <br />
Using ground and air reconnaissance, fire managers were able to determine the extent of the perimeter’s <br />
growth.<br />
<br />
Due to this fire growth, Colville Tribal Police issued additional Level 2 and Level 3 evacuation notices (see <br />
below). Fire crews, heavy equipment and air support engaged in structure protection in the newly affected <br />
areas. Firefighters on the south edge and southwest flank of the fire continued to build, connect and reinforce <br />
lines while crews on the west side successfully checked a fire that had moved across the containment lines.    <br />
<br />
Weather conditions are expected to moderate as a cold front enters the region. Rainfall is a possibility, but <br />
accumulations are forecast to be slight. Cooler temperatures and increased relative humidity could result in <br />
less active fire behavior.<br />
<br />
Today, firefighters will continue structure protection, reinforce existing lines around the fire’s edges and look <br />
for favorable areas to build containment lines. Priorities include protecting homes at Barnaby Creek through <br />
containment of the fire burning on Brush Mountain, and limiting fire spread from the southeast flank toward <br />
the Twin Lakes area. This will be the last daily update to include the Upper Lime Creek Fire; responsibility for <br />
this fireis scheduled to return to Mt. Tolman Fire Center (MTFC) today. For further information about the Upper <br />
Lime Creek Fire, contact MTFC at (509) 634-3100.<br />
<br />
Summit Trail Evacuations:<br />
<br />
·       Level 3 (Red “Go” – Leave Immediately!): Residences along Spring Creek Road and Barnaby Creek <br />
Road. Residences from LaFleur Meadows, including Hall Creek Road south of Bear Springs Road to Lynx <br />
Creek Road’s junction with Hall Creek Road. Intersection of BIA Road 1053 and Lynx Creek Road east to the <br />
intersection with Hall Creek Road. ·       Level 2 (Yellow “Get Set”): Residences along the Inchelium Highway <br />
from Inchelium to Highway 20. Twin Lakes area and structures along Bridge Creek Road. ·       Level 1 (Green <br />
– “Get Ready”): East of Seyler Valley Road to Gwen Mine Road and Cobb Creek Road.  <br />
<br />
Evacuation Shelter: Located at the Inchelium Longhouse and Community Center – 9 Community Loop, <br />

A Community Open house for the Walker and Chickadee fires was held last evening at the History Park <br />
Community Pool.  Fifty-four people attended the informative one and ½ hour session. <br />
<br />
Walker Creek Fire: Cooler temperatures and higher humidity moderated the fire behavior experienced on <br />
Sunday.   The fire still managed to increase by 2,552 acres on the southwest perimeter of the fire and west of <br />
Lost Lake. Once again aerial resources VLAT’s, retardant planes, Single Engine Air Tankers (SEAT’s) and <br />
heavy helicopters were used to assist firefighters and engine crews.  The fire has not reached Beaver <br />
Canyon.   <br />
<br />
Today’s activities include fireline construction from the southwest perimeter down to Highway 20, hot spotting <br />
west of Lost Lake, constructing indirect line with the heavy equipment on the northwest perimeter, connecting <br />
the northeast perimeter of the fire into a rock quarry on the Toroda road and gridding for hotspots in the Bunch <br />
road area.  Structure protection continues in the vicinity of the Bonaparte and Summer roads.   <br />
<br />
Chickadee Creek Fire:  Fire acreage remains the same from yesterday because an infrared mapping flight <br />
was not performed last evening. Fire officials report that that the fire did increase in size but not substantially.  <br />
Today’s activities include fireline preparation on the perimeter of the fire using existing roads, trails and natural <br />
features in anticipation of a future firing operation to remove the fuels between the main fire and firelines. <br />
<br />

 <br />
The Whitmore Fire is located on the Colville Reservation south of Omak Lake and west of Nespelem, WA. <br />
The Incident Command Post at Nespelem Community Center is closed to all but essential personnel to help <br />
ensure the health and safety of community members and firefighters.<br />
<br />
Temperatures will continue to trend lower today, with highs only in the 70s to mid-80s across the fire area. <br />
Winds shifted around to northerly last night and will be strong and gusty for most of the day. There is a slight <br />
chance of light showers and thunderstorms this afternoon.<br />
<br />
Operations<br />
Due to the sustained effort by crews working this fire, containment increased to 60% and the fire did not grow <br />
at all on Monday. Yesterday, firefighters and an engine secured structures at the Mount Whitmore Lookout, <br />
mopping up the area as heat sources remained creeping and smoldering nearby. Fire crews wrapped the <br />
historic Lookout with structure wrap, using a material similar to what is used for emergency fire shelters to <br />
protect from radiant heat and burning embers. Firefighters continued their work systematically gridding along <br />
the northern fire perimeter, looking for smoke and heat sources under the trees and mopping up 25 to 50 feet <br />
in from the fireline. In the Kartar Valley, fire crews mapped and identified future suppression repair needs and <br />
knocked down berms created while fighting the fire to minimize future erosion potential.<br />
<br />
Patrol and mop-up is ongoing today on the northern and eastern portions of the fire as firefighters work to <br />
secure the fire perimeter from any remaining smoldering heat sources close to the fireline. Decreasing activity <br />
on the Whitmore Fire requires fewer resources, allowing excess equipment and crews to be demobilized to <br />
assist on other fires in the region.<br />
<br />
Evacuations<br />
Today, all Level 2 evacuations on the Whitmore Fire have been reduced to Level 1 evacuations. The <br />
Columbia River Road corridor, Kartar Valley, Colville Agency, the community of Nespelem, and the SR155 <br />
corridor from Colville Agency north up to the Mission are now all in a level 1 evacuation status. Call Tribal <br />
Police at (509) 634-2472 with all evacuation questions.<br />
<br />
Road Closures<br />
Coyote Creek Road remains closed.</span>

<br />
Current Status: The fire is in full mop-op mode, and crews are continuing to monitor the perimeter for hot <br />
spots, completing mop-op where those spots presented a threat to control lines. Fire behavior is minimal and <br />
smoldering, but no active fire behavior has been observed. There is no anticipated change in the fire spread. <br />
Terrain within the burned area is steep and largely inaccessible, and smokejumpers assisted suppression <br />
efforts earlier in the week. Ground crews remain onsite. The fire is being managed jointly with the Schneider <br />
Springs Fire on the Naches Ranger District to the southwest, and some resources that were on the Windy <br />
Pass Fire have now been reassigned to assist suppression efforts in that area.<br />
<br />
Weather: High temperatures and low RH value are currently in the forecast through the day. A cold front <br />
passing through this morning will bring high wind gusts. An Excessive Heat Warning is in effect for today <br />
through 8:00 p.m. Closures:  The Forest Service has issued Closure Order 06-17-03-21-15 for the Taneum <br />
and Manastash drainages including Forest Roads FSR 3100, 3104, 3111, 3120, 3300, 3330, 3350, 3352, <br />
4100, 4110, and 4510. For further details on roads, trails, and campgrounds closed, please visit <br />
