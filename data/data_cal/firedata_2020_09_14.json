The Complex has been split into three zones to\neffectively provide a response for the communities at risk. Yesterday, in the West\nZone southerly winds allowed the smoke to thin somewhat over the fire area as\nwarm and dry conditions continue. This caused some moderate fire behavior\novernight. Winds will generally turn more south and then southwesterly and\nincrease as a weather system over the Pacific Ocean approaches the coast. This\nshould clear much of the smoke resulting in warmer temperatures and lower\nrelative humidity. As the onshore wind increases, humidity will eventually begin to\nincrease as well. Steep, inaccessible terrain and narrow winding roads continue to\nbe a challenge for firefighters. Crews will continue with direct and indirect line\nconstruction and identifying structure defense plans. </p>\n\n<p><b> Evacuation Orders, Evacuation Warnings, and Road Closures:</b></p>\n<p><b>Humboldt County</b></p>\n<p><i>Evacuation Order:</i></p>\n<li>South of Casterlin Road, including all properties on Casterlin Road to the\nMendocino/ Trinity County Line, east of Dyerville Loop Road and Bell Springs Road\nto the County Line</li></p>\n<p><i>Evacuation Warnings:</i></p>\n<li>All areas west of Bell Springs Road to Highway 101 spanning from Elk Creek Road /\nDyerville Loop Road to the Mendocino / Trinity County Line in Southern Humboldt\nCounty.</li></p>\n<p><i>Road Closures:</i></p>\n<li>Bell Springs road remains closed to the public\n<li>Alderpoint road at Dyerville Loop Road\n<li>Dyersville Loop Road at Fort Seward\n<li>Alderpoint road and Fort Seward road</li></p>\n\n<p><b>Trinity County</b></p>\n<p><i>Evacuation Orders:</i></p>\n<li>Ruth, Zenia, Kettenpom, Hettenshaw Valley</li></p>\n<p><i>Evacuation Warnings:</i></p>\n<li>Communities of Ruth Lake, Mad River, Forest Glen and Post Mountain</li></p>\n\n<p><b>Mendocino County</b></p>\n<p><i>Evacuation Orders:</i></p>\n<li>Zone S: South of the County Line, East of Bell Springs Rd, North of Bell Springs Creek\nand West of the North Fork of the Eel River.\n<li>Zone Q: South of the County Line, West and North of the North Fork of the Eel River\nand North and East of Bald Mountain road\n<li>Zone E: South of the county Line, East of the National Forest boundary, North of\nForest Highway 7 and West of the county Line near the M2.\n<li>Zone N: North of the Middle Fork of the Eel River including the Eel River Ranger\nStation and Black Butte Store, West and South of the National Forest Boundary, East\nof Williams Creek.\n<li>Zone D: South and East of the Eel river, North of Bentley Basin and West of the\nNational Forest Boundary\n<li>Zone C: North of the M1, East of the National Forest Boundary, south of Forest\nHighway 7.\n<li>Zone B: West of Evacuation Zone A, North of Jack Hollow Creek and Thatcher Creek,\nEast of the Middle Fork of the Eel River, South of Green Lambert Canyon through\nBentley Basin to the M1 and South of the M1, to include Timber Ridge, and Bentley\nRidge, and Hayshed Basin.\n<li>Zone A: West of the county line, south of Anthony Peak and North of Hull Mountain.\n<li>Zone J: East of Elk Creek, North and West of the National Forest Boundary, South of\nThatcher Creek.\n<li>Zone F: East of the National Forest boundary near Garcia Creek, South of Thatcher\nCreek, west of the County Line and North of the County Line on Hull Mountain.</li></p>\n<p><i>Evacuation Warnings:</i></p>\n<li>Zone U - South of the County Line, east and north of the East Branch of the South\nFork of the Eel River, west of Bell Springs Rd.\n<li>Zone T - South of Bell Springs, east of Bell Springs Rd, north of Iron Peak and\nSimmerly Rd, west of the Eel River.</li>\n<li>Zone R - West of and south of Mina Rd, south of the North Fork of Eel River, east of\nthe Eel River.\n<li>Zone P - South of the County Line, east of Mina Rd, north of Hulls Valley Rd and west\nof Hulls Creek.\n<li>Zone O - South of the County Line, east of Hulls Creek, north of Mendocino Pass Rd,\nand west of Williams Creek</li>\n<li>Zone L: South and West of Mendocino Pass Rd, West of The Middle Fork of the Eel\nRiver, north of Eel River Ranch Rd, East of Hill Rd and Short Creek Rd.\n<li>Zone K: West and North of the Middle Fork of the Eel River, East of Redwine Spring,\nSouth of Hill Rd and Eel River Ranch Rd.\n<li>Zone X: North of Eden Creek, East of Hearst Willits Rd, South and West of the Eel\nRiver.\n<li>Zone W: West of the Eel River, north of Deep Hole Creek, east of Eden Valley\nincluding the entire valley floor, south of Eden Creek.\n<li>Zone H: West of the National Forest Boundary, North of Thomas Creek and the Eel\nRiver, East of Twin Bridges Creek, South of Bald Mountain.\n<li>Zone G: West of the County Line, North of the Eel River and Van Aresdale Reservoir,\nEast of the Eel River, South of the National Forest Boundary.</li></p>\n<p><i>Road Closures:</i></p>\n<li>Private Driveway to Murphy Creek\n<li>Mendocino Pass Rd closed to eastbound traffic at the Williams Creek Bridge</li></p>\n\n<p><b>Evacuation Centers:</b></p>\n<p><i>Mendocino County</i><p>\n<p>Covelo High School, 76280 High School Street, Covelo, Ca<p>\n<p><i>Trinity County</i></p>\n<p>Humboldt County Fairgrounds, 1250 5th Street, Ferndale, CA 95536</p>\n<p>Southern Trinity High School Located at 600 Van Duzen Road</p>\n\n<p><b>Road Closures:</b> For updated road closure information visit: <a href=\"https://tinyurl.com/humboldtevac\">https://tinyurl.com/humboldtevac</a> and <a href=\" https://tinyurl.com/MendoEvac\"> https://tinyurl.com/MendoEvac</a>\n\n<p><b>Animal Evacuation Centers</b> </p>\n<p><b> Small Animals:</b> Ukiah Animal Shelter 298 Plant Rd.

The Creek Fire South Zone\nfirefighters are working on multiple fronts that will become more active as the smoke clears.</p>\n\n<p>A lot of good work has been accomplished over the four days that the smoke layer has held\nthe fire activity down. Crews will fight to hold and improve on that work today, and to add\nto the progress that has already been made. Patrol and extinguishment of hot spots will be\nthe focus around structures south of Huntington Lake where firefighters engaged with a\ndefensive firing operation that saved several structures. Fire also challenged the line in the\narea of Old Bretz Mill and Sierra Cedars. Firefighters were able to hold the line, preventing\nthe fire from moving toward nearby structures.</p>\n<p>The fire did burn over the line yesterday in Jose Basin on the southwest edge of the fire.\nCrews will work to pick the area up as it backs down the hill. They will also be patrolling\naround structures and mopping up any hot spots.</p>\n<p>Line construction will continue in multiple areas. Construction of fireline between Shaver\nLake and Dinky Creek is a high priority for fire managers. The lack of a suitable ridge to the\neast to use as a contingency line is a concern. Fireline work will continue along Cherry Valley\nand into Blue Canyon where firefighters are concerned that the fire could become aligned\nwith the wind and make a run. In the northeast the fire has been running along the North\nand South Zone dividing line for the fire. This finger of fire is burning in light fuels and\nmoving toward natural rock barriers that will slow spread.</p>\n\n<p><b>Current situation information from Madera County:</b></p> \n<p>The fire continues to push west toward Central Camp, challenging initial\nplans for containment lines in that area, but structure protection remains in place.\nFirefighters are developing and improving containment line on the west side of the fire from\nRedinger Lake north to Cascadel Woods and Central Camp.</p> \n<p>The weather pattern is beginning to shift; increasing winds are likely to begin moving smoke\nout of the north end of the fire, which is also expected to encourage fire growth to the\nnortheast. Structure protection is underway on the north side of the fire, at Devil\u2019s Post Pile National Monument, and Reds Meadows.</p>\n<p>With better visibility, air operations are expected to resume. There have been conflicts between firefighting operations and drones. If you fly, we can\u2019t! Please comply with the temporary flight restriction. Don\u2019t be the reason a firefighting air mission has to divert from the operation.</p>\n<p>The Madera County Sheriff continues to enforce evacuation notices and maintain road closures to protect the public. Damage assessments are in progress; the county will notify property owners directly as information becomes available. Firefighters are working to clear roads so that utility companies have access to restore service, as the sheriff\u2019s office begins to develop plans for residents to return to communities.</p>\n<p><b>Incident Briefing</b></p>\n<p>The Sierra National Forest will host an Incident Briefing tonight at 7pm via Facebook Live: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/SierraNF/\"> https://www.facebook.com/SierraNF/</a></p>\n\n<p>Damage inspection teams are evaluating structures; assessments are approximately 5%\ncomplete.

Unauthorized drone flights pose serious risks to firefighter and public safety and the effectiveness of wildfire suppression operations</p>\n<p>If an unauthorized drone is detected flying over or near a wildfire, fire managers may have to ground all airtankers, helicopters, and other aerial firefighting aircraft until they can confirm that the drone has left the area and they feel confident that it won\u2019t be coming back. This can cause wildfires to become larger and more costly and to unduly threaten lives, property, and valuable natural and cultural resources.</p>\n<p>Aerial firefighting aircraft, such as airtankers and helicopters, fly at very low altitudes, typically just a couple of hundred feet above the ground and in the same airspace as drones flown by the public. This creates the potential for a mid-air collision, or a pilot distraction that results in a crash, that could seriously injure or kill aerial and/or ground firefighters. </p>\n<p>Temporary Flight Restrictions (TFRs) typically put in place during wildfires require manned or unmanned aircraft not involved in wildfire suppression operations to obtain permission to enter specified airspace. The FAA, U.S. Forest Service, U.S. Department of the Interior and other wildland fire management agencies consider drones, including those flown by the public for fun, to be aircraft and therefore subject to TFRs. Members of the public should not fly drones over or near wildfires even if a TFR is not in place because of the potential for accidents and disruption of suppression operations. Individuals who are determined to have interfered with wildfire suppression efforts may be subject to civil penalties of up to $20,000 and potentially\ncriminal prosecution, per California Penal Code Section 402(2). Members of the public who have witnessed, or who have information about an unauthorized drone flight over or near a wildfire, should contact local law enforcement</p>\n<p>Even though smoke or fire may not be visible, drones should not be operated in or around the wildfire area as firefighting aircraft could still be flying.</p>\n<p>The U.S. Department of the Interior, in partnership with other federal, state, and local agencies, has developed a wildfire location data-sharing program called \u201cCurrent Wildland Fires\u201d to inform drone pilots of areas to avoid flying over or near. Additional information is available at <a href= \"https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/interior-expands-information-sharing-initiative-prevent-drone-incursions\">https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/interior-expands-information-sharing-initiative-prevent-drone-incursions</a></p>\n<p>Wildland fire management agencies are also using a variety of communication tools to connect with drone pilots. The \u201cIf You Fly, We Can\u2019t\u201d safety awareness campaign is designed to keep drone pilots away from airspace used by firefighters.

It has been burning in 100 year-old fuels consisting of Big Cone\nDouglas Fir, Oak, and Gray Pine. The fire is holding northeast of Interstate 5 and south of Highway 138\nin steep and rugged terrain. Control lines have been completed all around the fire\u2019s perimeter. Firefighters are now patrolling the fire\nline to ensure that all lines continue to hold and that there is no heat near the fire\u2019s perimeter.\nFirefighters have been monitoring the fire area for pockets of isolated heat and smoke. When safe to do\nso, firefighters have gone into the interior of the fire area to fully extinguish those hot spots that may\npose a threat of spotting and escaping over containment lines. Helicopters have also been assisting\nground crews in extinguishing these hot spots with water bucket drops. Crews have been able to perform\na significant amount of fire suppression repair around the fire; primarily focusing on blocking off public\naccess to dozers lines, rehabilitating some of these lines and installing a large number of water bars to\nprevent against erosion. However, due to the elevated fire activity throughout California and the\ndrawdown of resources, crews will not be able to fully complete fire suppression repair of the entire fire\narea at this time.

The Map includes a list of damaged and destroyed structures provided by CAL FIRE\u2019s Damage Inspection Teams. Damage inspections, including locations, are preliminary and numerous sites still require confirmation. The CAL FIRE Damage Inspection teams are working as quickly as possible to supply the needed information to those that were evacuated during the firestorm. CAL FIRE Damage Inspection teams were deployed to the fire zones early on during the fires to start the identification process.

Thanks to cooperative winds, firefighters were able to continue protecting the Lookout Rock and Ontop Mine areas. Moving west, fire activity is more active and in rugged terrain. Crews were able to engage directly with the fire\u2019s edge and mop up other areas, working toward their goal of tying into the 2018 Camp Fire scar.</p>\n<p>Some spotting behavior did occur, however firefighters were quick to catch them. Night crews plan to revisit areas that were already fired to make sure they are complete and secure. Structure protection groups are in place surrounding the fire\u2019s perimeter to protect nearby communities, taking extra care in getting through the incoming wind event.</p>\n<p>South Zone: Firefighters made great progress today in improving and securing containment lines, and were successful in making the final connection between Little Grass Valley Reservoir south along Mooreville Ridge to Sly Creek Reservoir. In the extremely steep terrain near McCarthy\u2019s Bar, crews were able to start firing operations which will eventually back into the main body of the fire.</p>\n<p>West Zone: This area is being managed by CAL FIRE/Butte County: <a href=\"https://www.fire.ca.gov/incidents/2020/8/18/north-complex-fire/\"> https://www.fire.ca.gov/incidents/2020/8/18/north-complex-fire/ </a>.</p>\n\n<p>Two additional fatalities were reported today by the Butte County Sheriff\u2019s Department.</p>\n<p>Video operational updates along with live broadcasts can be viewed on Plumas National Forest\u2019s Facebook page.</p>\n\n<p><b>Evacuations and Road Closures</b></p>\n<p>Due to the expected wind event, Butte County Sheriffs issued an Evacuation Warning this morning for the area west of Table Mountain to Highway 70, North of Garden Drive and the water canal.</p>\n<p>Evacuation orders and advisories were lifted in areas of Oroville and Brownsville.</p>\n<p>The Evacuation Order was for Bangor area from Forbestown Rd South to Swedes Flat Rd, East of Miners Ranch Rd to the county line was also reduced to an Evacuation advisory.</p>\n<p>Mandatory evacuation orders and advisories are in place for Butte, Plumas, and Yuba Counties.

The Creek Fire South Zone\nfirefighters are working on multiple fronts that will become more active as the smoke clears.</p>\n\n<p>A lot of good work has been accomplished over the four days that the smoke layer has held\nthe fire activity down. Crews will fight to hold and improve on that work today, and to add\nto the progress that has already been made. Patrol and extinguishment of hot spots will be\nthe focus around structures south of Huntington Lake where firefighters engaged with a\ndefensive firing operation that saved several structures. Fire also challenged the line in the\narea of Old Bretz Mill and Sierra Cedars. Firefighters were able to hold the line, preventing\nthe fire from moving toward nearby structures.</p>\n<p>The fire did burn over the line yesterday in Jose Basin on the southwest edge of the fire.\nCrews will work to pick the area up as it backs down the hill. They will also be patrolling\naround structures and mopping up any hot spots.</p>\n<p>Line construction will continue in multiple areas. Construction of fireline between Shaver\nLake and Dinky Creek is a high priority for fire managers. The lack of a suitable ridge to the\neast to use as a contingency line is a concern. Fireline work will continue along Cherry Valley\nand into Blue Canyon where firefighters are concerned that the fire could become aligned\nwith the wind and make a run. In the northeast the fire has been running along the North\nand South Zone dividing line for the fire. This finger of fire is burning in light fuels and\nmoving toward natural rock barriers that will slow spread.</p>\n\n<p><b>Current situation information from Madera County:</b></p> \n<p>The fire continues to push west toward Central Camp, challenging initial\nplans for containment lines in that area, but structure protection remains in place.\nFirefighters are developing and improving containment line on the west side of the fire from\nRedinger Lake north to Cascadel Woods and Central Camp.</p> \n<p>The weather pattern is beginning to shift; increasing winds are likely to begin moving smoke\nout of the north end of the fire, which is also expected to encourage fire growth to the\nnortheast. Structure protection is underway on the north side of the fire, at Devil\u2019s Post Pile National Monument, and Reds Meadows.</p>\n<p>With better visibility, air operations are expected to resume. There have been conflicts between firefighting operations and drones. If you fly, we can\u2019t! Please comply with the temporary flight restriction. Don\u2019t be the reason a firefighting air mission has to divert from the operation.</p>\n<p>The Madera County Sheriff continues to enforce evacuation notices and maintain road closures to protect the public. Damage assessments are in progress; the county will notify property owners directly as information becomes available. Firefighters are working to clear roads so that utility companies have access to restore service, as the sheriff\u2019s office begins to develop plans for residents to return to communities.</p>\n<p><b>Incident Briefing</b></p>\n<p>The Sierra National Forest will host an Incident Briefing tonight at 7pm via Facebook Live: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/SierraNF/\"> https://www.facebook.com/SierraNF/</a></p>\n\n<p>Damage inspection teams are evaluating structures; assessments are approximately 5%\ncomplete.

Unauthorized drone flights pose serious risks to firefighter and public safety and the effectiveness of wildfire suppression operations</p>\n<p>If an unauthorized drone is detected flying over or near a wildfire, fire managers may have to ground all airtankers, helicopters, and other aerial firefighting aircraft until they can confirm that the drone has left the area and they feel confident that it won\u2019t be coming back. This can cause wildfires to become larger and more costly and to unduly threaten lives, property, and valuable natural and cultural resources.</p>\n<p>Aerial firefighting aircraft, such as airtankers and helicopters, fly at very low altitudes, typically just a couple of hundred feet above the ground and in the same airspace as drones flown by the public. This creates the potential for a mid-air collision, or a pilot distraction that results in a crash, that could seriously injure or kill aerial and/or ground firefighters. </p>\n<p>Temporary Flight Restrictions (TFRs) typically put in place during wildfires require manned or unmanned aircraft not involved in wildfire suppression operations to obtain permission to enter specified airspace. The FAA, U.S. Forest Service, U.S. Department of the Interior and other wildland fire management agencies consider drones, including those flown by the public for fun, to be aircraft and therefore subject to TFRs. Members of the public should not fly drones over or near wildfires even if a TFR is not in place because of the potential for accidents and disruption of suppression operations. Individuals who are determined to have interfered with wildfire suppression efforts may be subject to civil penalties of up to $20,000 and potentially\ncriminal prosecution, per California Penal Code Section 402(2). Members of the public who have witnessed, or who have information about an unauthorized drone flight over or near a wildfire, should contact local law enforcement</p>\n<p>Even though smoke or fire may not be visible, drones should not be operated in or around the wildfire area as firefighting aircraft could still be flying.</p>\n<p>The U.S. Department of the Interior, in partnership with other federal, state, and local agencies, has developed a wildfire location data-sharing program called \u201cCurrent Wildland Fires\u201d to inform drone pilots of areas to avoid flying over or near. Additional information is available at <a href= \"https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/interior-expands-information-sharing-initiative-prevent-drone-incursions\">https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/interior-expands-information-sharing-initiative-prevent-drone-incursions</a></p>\n<p>Wildland fire management agencies are also using a variety of communication tools to connect with drone pilots. The \u201cIf You Fly, We Can\u2019t\u201d safety awareness campaign is designed to keep drone pilots away from airspace used by firefighters.
