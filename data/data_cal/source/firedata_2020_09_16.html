{"Incidents":[{"UniqueId":"b8f267be-9911-44ee-8a73-7a0537fbd6fa","Name":"August Complex (includes Doe Fire)","Location":" Mendocino, Humboldt, Del Norte, & Trinity County","Latitude":39.776,"Longitude":-122.673,"AcresBurned":794801.0,"FuelType":null,"PercentContained":30.0,"ControlStatement":"Lightning sparked multiple fires across the Mendocino National Forest early Sunday morning.","ConditionStatement":"<p><b>Change in total acreage per the US forest service.</b></p>\n\n<p><b>Current Situation:</b> CAL FIRE’S unified team and the U.S. Forest Service are engaged in a coordinated response to take suppressive action on the August Complex, which has been split into three zones to effectively provide a response for the communities at risk. The complexity of four teams managing one fire resulted in some acres being counted twice. Reconciliation of the acreage calculations puts the current acreage of the August Complex West Zone at 35,398 acres. Resources from across the state of California as well as Montana, Utah, Texas, and New Jersey have been assigned to assist on the August Complex West Zone. The fire remained active today, with isolated torching observed on the southern boundary. It has continued to make\nuphill slope-driven runs when in alignment with topography. A low-pressure system sitting off the west coast will make little progress toward the fire today, resulting in similar weather for tomorrow. Relative humidity will remain fairly low with poor\novernight recoveries for the upper slopes and ridges allowing the fire to remain active through the night. </p>\n\n<p><b> Evacuation Orders, Evacuation Warnings, and Road Closures:</b></p>\n<p><b>Humboldt County</b></p>\n<p>For the latest road closures and evacuation information in Humboldt County please visit:  <a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1Y_qCH75uA9ViOP0bao2-Cv07uB3pX3XG&ll=40.209730371490714%2C-123.54374267330414&z=9 >Humboldtgov.org/evacmap</a>\n<p><i>Evacuation Order:</i></p>\n<li>Areas south of Casterlin Road, including all properties on Casterlin Road, to the Mendocino/ Trinity County Line and east of Dyerville Loop Road and Bell Springs Road to the county line.</li></p>\n<p><i>Evacuation Warnings:</i></p>\n<li>All areas west of Bell Springs Road to Highway 101 spanning from Elk Creek Road / Dyerville Loop Road to the Mendocino / Trinity County line in Southern Humboldt County</li></p>\n<li>All areas east of Alderpoint Road spanning from Highway 36 to Casterlin Road, not including all properties on Casterlin Road.</li></p>\n<p><i>Road Closures:</i></p>\n<li>Alderpoint road at Dyerville Loop Road\n<li>Alderpoint road and Fort Seward road</li></p>\n\n<p><b>Trinity County</b></p>\n<p><i>Evacuation Orders:</i></p>\n<li>Ruth, Zenia, Kettenpom, Hettenshaw Valley</li></p>\n<p><i>Evacuation Warnings:</i></p>\n<li>Communities of Ruth Lake, Mad River, Forest Glen and Post Mountain</li></p>\n<p><b>Road Closures:</b></p>\n<li>Bell Springs Road at Duggan Mill Road</li>\n<li>Cedar Road south of the Ruth Ranger Station</li>\n<li>Lower Mad River Road from Journey's End</li>\n<li>Van Duzen Road at Lake Mountain Road</li>\n<li>Lower Mad River Road and Ruth Lake Marina</li>\n<li>Lake Mountain Road and Ruth Zenia Road</li></p>\n\n<p><b>Mendocino County</b></p>\n<p>For the latest road closures and evacuation information in Mendocino County\nplease visit <a href=\" https://tinyurl.com/MendoEvac\"> https://tinyurl.com/MendoEvac</a></p>\n<p><i>Evacuation Orders:</i></p>\n<li>Zone AB: South of the Middle Fork of the Eel River, west of Eden Creek, north of Salt\nFlat and east of Salt Creek</li>\n<li>Zone AC: East of Brushy Mountain, south of the fire road on Salt Flat, west of Eden\nValley and north of Bald Mountain</li>\n<li>Zone S: South of the county line, east of Bell Springs Road, north of Bell Springs\nCreek and west of the North Fork of the Eel River.</li>\n<li>Zone Q: South of the county line, west and north of the North Fork of the Eel River\nand north and east of Bald Mountain Road</li>\n<li>Zone E: South of the county line, east of the National Forest boundary, north of\nForest Highway 7 and west of the county line near the M2.</li>\n<li>Zone N: North of the Middle Fork of the Eel River including the Eel River Ranger\nStation and Black Butte Store, west and south of the National Forest Boundary, east </li>\n<li>Zone D: South and East of the Eel river, North of Bentley Basin and West of the\nNational Forest Boundary</li>\n<li>Zone C: North of the M1, East of the National Forest Boundary, south of Forest\nHighway 7.</li>\n<li>Zone B: West of Evacuation Zone A, North of Jack Hollow Creek and Thatcher Creek,\nEast of the Middle Fork of the Eel River, South of Green Lambert Canyon through\nBentley Basin to the M1 and South of the M1, to include Timber Ridge, and Bentley\nRidge, and Hayshed Basin.</li>\n<li>Zone A: West of the county line, south of Anthony Peak and North of Hull Mountain.</li>\n<li>Zone F: East of the National Forest boundary near Garcia Creek, South of Thatcher\nCreek, west of the County Line and North of the County Line on Hull Mountain.</li>\n<li>Zone H: West of the National Forest Boundary, North of Thomas Creek and the Eel\nRiver, East of Twin Bridges Creek, South of Bald Mountain</li>\n<li>Zone I: West of Elk Creek, South of Deep Hole Creek, North of the National Forest\nBoundary.</li>\n<li>Zone J: East of Elk River, north of Deep Hole Creek, east of Eden Valley, south of\nThatcher Creek.</li>\n<li>Zone W: West of the Eel River, north of Deep Hole Creek, east of Eden Valley\nincluding the entire valley floor, south of Eden Creek.</li>\n\n<p><i>Evacuation Warnings:</i></p>\n<li>Zone U -

We need to remain vigilant.</p> \n<p>There was an increase in temperatures today over the fire area due to the smoke layer dissipating but the humidity remained above 20%. The clearing of the smoke also had a negative effect on the fire causing fire activity to increase across the fire area throughout the day.</p> \n<p>Aircraft, in most cases, had good visibility to be able to fly over the fire assisting firefighters on the ground. A few times smoke did develop over the fire and hampered some aircraft utilization.</p> \n<p>Firefighters continue to be successful in strengthening several existing containment lines, developing new containment lines and extinguishing several interior hot spots in an attempt to prevent further spread. Firefighters continue to fight to get into those areas of difficult access to make sure those areas of the fire are contained.

Multiple Evacuation Orders were reduced to Evacuation Warnings an multiple Evacuation Warnings were lifted. This change in evacuation status was a result of the excellent work done by fire crews in Jose Basin where the fire pushed over the lines yesterday and threatended structures.

Unauthorized drone flights pose serious risks to firefighter and public safety and the effectiveness of wildfire suppression operations</p>\n<p>If an unauthorized drone is detected flying over or near a wildfire, fire managers may have to ground all airtankers, helicopters, and other aerial firefighting aircraft until they can confirm that the drone has left the area and they feel confident that it won’t be coming back. This can cause wildfires to become larger and more costly and to unduly threaten lives, property, and valuable natural and cultural resources.</p>\n<p>Aerial firefighting aircraft, such as airtankers and helicopters, fly at very low altitudes, typically just a couple of hundred feet above the ground and in the same airspace as drones flown by the public. This creates the potential for a mid-air collision, or a pilot distraction that results in a crash, that could seriously injure or kill aerial and/or ground firefighters. </p>\n<p>Temporary Flight Restrictions (TFRs) typically put in place during wildfires require manned or unmanned aircraft not involved in wildfire suppression operations to obtain permission to enter specified airspace. The FAA, U.S. Forest Service, U.S. Department of the Interior and other wildland fire management agencies consider drones, including those flown by the public for fun, to be aircraft and therefore subject to TFRs. Members of the public should not fly drones over or near wildfires even if a TFR is not in place because of the potential for accidents and disruption of suppression operations. Individuals who are determined to have interfered with wildfire suppression efforts may be subject to civil penalties of up to $20,000 and potentially\ncriminal prosecution, per California Penal Code Section 402(2). Members of the public who have witnessed, or who have information about an unauthorized drone flight over or near a wildfire, should contact local law enforcement</p>\n<p>Even though smoke or fire may not be visible, drones should not be operated in or around the wildfire area as firefighting aircraft could still be flying.</p>\n<p>The U.S. Department of the Interior, in partnership with other federal, state, and local agencies, has developed a wildfire location data-sharing program called “Current Wildland Fires” to inform drone pilots of areas to avoid flying over or near. Additional information is available at <a href= \"https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/interior-expands-information-sharing-initiative-prevent-drone-incursions\">https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/interior-expands-information-sharing-initiative-prevent-drone-incursions</a></p>\n<p>Wildland fire management agencies are also using a variety of communication tools to connect with drone pilots. The “If You Fly, We Can’t” safety awareness campaign is designed to keep drone pilots away from airspace used by firefighters.

Firefighters are now patrolling the fire\nline to ensure that all lines continue to hold and that there is no heat near the fire’s perimeter.\nFirefighters have been monitoring the fire area for pockets of isolated heat and smoke. When safe to do\nso, firefighters have gone into the interior of the fire area to fully extinguish those hot spots that may\npose a threat of spotting and escaping over containment lines. Helicopters have also been assisting\nground crews in extinguishing these hot spots with water bucket drops. Crews have been able to perform\na significant amount of fire suppression repair around the fire; primarily focusing on blocking off public\naccess to dozers lines, rehabilitating some of these lines and installing a large number of water bars to\nprevent against erosion. However, due to the elevated fire activity throughout California and the\ndrawdown of resources, crews will not be able to fully complete fire suppression repair of the entire fire\narea at this time.

The complexity of four teams managing one fire resulted in some acres being counted twice. Reconciliation of the acreage calculations puts the current acreage of the August Complex West Zone at 35,398 acres. Resources from across the state of California as well as Montana, Utah, Texas, and New Jersey have been assigned to assist on the August Complex West Zone. The fire remained active today, with isolated torching observed on the southern boundary. It has continued to make\nuphill slope-driven runs when in alignment with topography. A low-pressure system sitting off the west coast will make little progress toward the fire today, resulting in similar weather for tomorrow. Relative humidity will remain fairly low with poor\novernight recoveries for the upper slopes and ridges allowing the fire to remain active through the night. </p>\n\n<p><b> Evacuation Orders, Evacuation Warnings, and Road Closures:</b></p>\n<p><b>Humboldt County</b></p>\n<p>For the latest road closures and evacuation information in Humboldt County please visit:  <a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1Y_qCH75uA9ViOP0bao2-Cv07uB3pX3XG&ll=40.209730371490714%2C-123.54374267330414&z=9 >Humboldtgov.org/evacmap</a>\n<p><i>Evacuation Order:</i></p>\n<li>Areas south of Casterlin Road, including all properties on Casterlin Road, to the Mendocino/ Trinity County Line and east of Dyerville Loop Road and Bell Springs Road to the county line.</li></p>\n<p><i>Evacuation Warnings:</i></p>\n<li>All areas west of Bell Springs Road to Highway 101 spanning from Elk Creek Road / Dyerville Loop Road to the Mendocino / Trinity County line in Southern Humboldt County</li></p>\n<li>All areas east of Alderpoint Road spanning from Highway 36 to Casterlin Road, not including all properties on Casterlin Road.</li></p>\n<p><i>Road Closures:</i></p>\n<li>Alderpoint road at Dyerville Loop Road\n<li>Alderpoint road and Fort Seward road</li></p>\n\n<p><b>Trinity County</b></p>\n<p><i>Evacuation Orders:</i></p>\n<li>Ruth, Zenia, Kettenpom, Hettenshaw Valley</li></p>\n<p><i>Evacuation Warnings:</i></p>\n<li>Communities of Ruth Lake, Mad River, Forest Glen and Post Mountain</li></p>\n<p><b>Road Closures:</b></p>\n<li>Bell Springs Road at Duggan Mill Road</li>\n<li>Cedar Road south of the Ruth Ranger Station</li>\n<li>Lower Mad River Road from Journey's End</li>\n<li>Van Duzen Road at Lake Mountain Road</li>\n<li>Lower Mad River Road and Ruth Lake Marina</li>\n<li>Lake Mountain Road and Ruth Zenia Road</li></p>\n\n<p><b>Mendocino County</b></p>\n<p>For the latest road closures and evacuation information in Mendocino County\nplease visit <a href=\" https://tinyurl.com/MendoEvac\"> https://tinyurl.com/MendoEvac</a></p>\n<p><i>Evacuation Orders:</i></p>\n<li>Zone AB: South of the Middle Fork of the Eel River, west of Eden Creek, north of Salt\nFlat and east of Salt Creek</li>\n<li>Zone AC: East of Brushy Mountain, south of the fire road on Salt Flat, west of Eden\nValley and north of Bald Mountain</li>\n<li>Zone S: South of the county line, east of Bell Springs Road, north of Bell Springs\nCreek and west of the North Fork of the Eel River.</li>\n<li>Zone Q: South of the county line, west and north of the North Fork of the Eel River\nand north and east of Bald Mountain Road</li>\n<li>Zone E: South of the county line, east of the National Forest boundary, north of\nForest Highway 7 and west of the county line near the M2.</li>\n<li>Zone N: North of the Middle Fork of the Eel River including the Eel River Ranger\nStation and Black Butte Store, west and south of the National Forest Boundary, east </li>\n<li>Zone D: South and East of the Eel river, North of Bentley Basin and West of the\nNational Forest Boundary</li>\n<li>Zone C: North of the M1, East of the National Forest Boundary, south of Forest\nHighway 7.</li>\n<li>Zone B: West of Evacuation Zone A, North of Jack Hollow Creek and Thatcher Creek,\nEast of the Middle Fork of the Eel River, South of Green Lambert Canyon through\nBentley Basin to the M1 and South of the M1, to include Timber Ridge, and Bentley\nRidge, and Hayshed Basin.</li>\n<li>Zone A: West of the county line, south of Anthony Peak and North of Hull Mountain.</li>\n<li>Zone F: East of the National Forest boundary near Garcia Creek, South of Thatcher\nCreek, west of the County Line and North of the County Line on Hull Mountain.</li>\n<li>Zone H: West of the National Forest Boundary, North of Thomas Creek and the Eel\nRiver, East of Twin Bridges Creek, South of Bald Mountain</li>\n<li>Zone I: West of Elk Creek, South of Deep Hole Creek, North of the National Forest\nBoundary.</li>\n<li>Zone J: East of Elk River, north of Deep Hole Creek, east of Eden Valley, south of\nThatcher Creek.</li>\n<li>Zone W: West of the Eel River, north of Deep Hole Creek, east of Eden Valley\nincluding the entire valley floor, south of Eden Creek.</li>\n\n<p><i>Evacuation Warnings:</i></p>\n<li>Zone U -

\n<p><b>Current situation information from Fresno County:</b></p> \n<p>Several changes were made today regarding Fresno County evacuations. Multiple Evacuation Orders were reduced to Evacuation Warnings an multiple Evacuation Warnings were lifted. This change in evacuation status was a result of the excellent work done by fire crews in Jose Basin where the fire pushed over the lines yesterday and threatended structures. New lines were established throughout the day and tested by the wind last night.</p>\n<p>A tactical firing operation began today in Cherry Valley where the fire backed down to a mid-slope road. This operation is a planned action and will continue over the next operational period. The goal is to remove fuels between the line and the fire’s edge to prevent further spread into Blue Canyon when the wind shifts later this week. The fire is burning actively in the northeast near the South San Joaquin River. Fire continued to back and flank along the east side of the fire. The eastern portion of the fire has burned in a very mosaic pattern with large green islands.

The air and fuels remain dry and ready to ignite. Fire remains active with a potential for large growth when in alignment with canyons. Fire resources will continue building containment lines and directly attacking the fire from the air and ground.</p>\n\n<p>The evacuation warning and order remain in effect for portions of Mentone and Yucaipa. Residents of Angelus Oaks, 7 Oaks, Barton Flats up to Onyx Summit are under an Evacuation order. Please review the Evacuation Warnings and Orders at the end of this update to determine if you live in an evacuated area.</p>\n\n<p>The San Bernardino County Sheriffs department and the El Dorado Fire Unified Incident Commanders continue the advisory for visitors to consider rescheduling planned visits to the Big Bear area due to fire activity.</p>\n\n<p>Neighbors, please stay vigilant and check Inciweb, Twitter and Facebook for changes on the #ElDoradoFire.

Unauthorized drone flights pose serious risks to firefighter and public safety and the effectiveness of wildfire suppression operations</p>\n<p>If an unauthorized drone is detected flying over or near a wildfire, fire managers may have to ground all airtankers, helicopters, and other aerial firefighting aircraft until they can confirm that the drone has left the area and they feel confident that it won’t be coming back. This can cause wildfires to become larger and more costly and to unduly threaten lives, property, and valuable natural and cultural resources.</p>\n<p>Aerial firefighting aircraft, such as airtankers and helicopters, fly at very low altitudes, typically just a couple of hundred feet above the ground and in the same airspace as drones flown by the public. This creates the potential for a mid-air collision, or a pilot distraction that results in a crash, that could seriously injure or kill aerial and/or ground firefighters. </p>\n<p>Temporary Flight Restrictions (TFRs) typically put in place during wildfires require manned or unmanned aircraft not involved in wildfire suppression operations to obtain permission to enter specified airspace. The FAA, U.S. Forest Service, U.S. Department of the Interior and other wildland fire management agencies consider drones, including those flown by the public for fun, to be aircraft and therefore subject to TFRs. Members of the public should not fly drones over or near wildfires even if a TFR is not in place because of the potential for accidents and disruption of suppression operations. Individuals who are determined to have interfered with wildfire suppression efforts may be subject to civil penalties of up to $20,000 and potentially\ncriminal prosecution, per California Penal Code Section 402(2). Members of the public who have witnessed, or who have information about an unauthorized drone flight over or near a wildfire, should contact local law enforcement</p>\n<p>Even though smoke or fire may not be visible, drones should not be operated in or around the wildfire area as firefighting aircraft could still be flying.</p>\n<p>The U.S. Department of the Interior, in partnership with other federal, state, and local agencies, has developed a wildfire location data-sharing program called “Current Wildland Fires” to inform drone pilots of areas to avoid flying over or near. Additional information is available at <a href= \"https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/interior-expands-information-sharing-initiative-prevent-drone-incursions\">https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/interior-expands-information-sharing-initiative-prevent-drone-incursions</a></p>\n<p>Wildland fire management agencies are also using a variety of communication tools to connect with drone pilots. The “If You Fly, We Can’t” safety awareness campaign is designed to keep drone pilots away from airspace used by firefighters.
