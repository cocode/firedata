Strategic firing will continue to secure the area. Helicopter water drops were utilized\nalong South Fork Mountain on the ridge lines to slow the progression of the fire, allowing dozer lines to be\nconstructed behind houses for structure defense. These operations will continue throughout the week.\nDozers and other heavy equipment continue to tie in ridges and existing roads to keep the fire south of Highway\n36. Firefighting resources and dozers are also working hard within and around the community of Post\nMountain/Trinity Pines to improve pre-existing dozer lines.</p>\n<p>Fire managers are focused on the protection and defense of the communities of Ruth Lake, Forest Glen and\nTrinity Pines/Post Mountain. Structure protection is ongoing and can mean improving existing fire lines\nsurrounding communities, clearing flammable vegetation around structures, and installing hose lays or sprinkler\nsystems around structures.</p>\n<p>The eastern portion of the fire east of East Low Gap crews are mopping up, improving fire lines, dropping snags\nand making sure the fire line will continue to hold. Ground resources will be actively patrolling containment\nlines.</p>\n<p>In the Yolla Bolly-Middle Eel Wilderness the fire will remain active along Wrights Valley and Shell Mountain.\nWildfire activity can change quickly and evacuation warnings and orders may also change at any time. The public\nis reminded to stay aware of fire conditions and follow all Evacuation Orders and Warnings.\nWeather conditions A low pressure system will approach the Pacific Northwest on Wednesday causing\nincreased winds and lower humidity within the fire area.</p>\n<p><b>Know Before You Go</b></p>\n<p>Be fire safe by doing the following:</p>\n<li>Before going hiking or camping, check with the forest or ranger district for fire restrictions or area closures.\n<li>Plan ahead and prepare — know your route, and tell someone where you are going and when you plan to\nreturn.\n<li>Use alternatives to campfires during high fire danger, even if there are no restrictions. Nine out of 10 fires are\ncaused by humans.\n<p><b>Stay safe when hunting by following these tips:</b></p>\n<li>Many hunting areas are closed due to wildfire activity. Check local districts and forests for closure orders.\n<li>Be alert when hunting near developed areas and trails. Firefighters are in the forest as well.\n<li>Clearly identify your target before shooting.

CAL FIRE’s Incident Management Team ordered the National Guard to assist with fire suppression efforts due to resource draw down throughout the state, 125 National Guard personnel are assigned to the incident. The current acreage of the August Complex West Zone is 93,942 acres and is 30% contained. Resources from across the state of California as well as Montana, Idaho, Texas, and New Jersey have been assigned to assist on the August Complex-West Zone. Some evacuation orders and warnings have been reduced. Successful firing operations near Lake Pillsbury today helped eliminate isolated pockets of unburned fuels. In areas experiencing diminished fire behavior further north, firefighters continued mop-up and direct fire attack. Smoke continues to be highly visible due to firing operations, active pockets of fire and multiple areas with smoldering and creeping fire.</p>\n\n<p><b> Evacuation Orders, Evacuation Warnings, and Road Closures:</b></p>\n\n<p><b>Humboldt County</b></p>\n<p>For the latest road closures and evacuation information in Humboldt County please visit: <a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1Y_qCH75uA9ViOP0bao2-Cv07uB3pX3XG&ll=40.209730371490714%2C-123.54374267330414&z=9\">Humboldtgov.org/evacmap</a></p>\n<p><i>Evacuation Order:</i> NONE</p>\n<p><i>Evacuation Warnings:</i>NONE</p>\n\n\n<p><i>Road Closures:</i> All road closures due to the August Complex West Zone Fire have been lifted.

Throughout\ntoday and overnight the fire will remain active and thermal belts and dry fuels in Central Camp, Gaggs Campground, and Timber Creek will promote fire activity. Elsewhere, the\nmost activity will be around Whisky Falls and towards Timber Butte , progressing and north of Strawberry Mine. Along the eastern edge of the fire in the Bog Cabin to Pine\nFlat are it will be limited by rocky terrain and lighter fuels.</p>\n\n<p>Warm and dry conditions will persist today including terrain driven winds for most of the fire area and southwest winds gusting to twenty-two miles per hour along the ridge top. Relative humidity will drop to fourteen to twenty-four percent with poor recoveries\nin the higher elevations and only moderate recoveries in lower elevations. These conditions can be expected through Friday with warmer weather expected over the\nweekend and into next week. </p>\n\n<p>The priority for the North Zone of the Creek Fire remains the construction and improvement of containment line. Fire spread is being monitored while structures in\nthreatened areas have been prepped for the defense.</p>\n\n<p><b>South Zone:</b></p> \n<p>Areas of the South Zone were active along the South Fork of the San Joaquin River as it progresses south along the solid rock rim of the drainage while on the eastern side of the fire burning is occurring towards the Dinkey Lakes Wilderness. Yesterday’s firing operation will continue to burn out in the Sycamore Creek drainage, as previously\nunburnt fuels become fully consumed, which provides assistance in containment. Around Portal Forebay the fire may move south. </p>\n\n<p>Additional fire progression will be south of Mount Tom but slow as it reaches rocky higher elevation areas with less fuels. Areas with heavier fuels, such as dense beds of\nground fuel and timer, will smolder. </p>\n\n<p>Operational priorities for the South Zone of the Creek Fire remains enhancing containment with improvement of line and completion of the firing operation around\nSycamore Creek. In other areas tactical patrol to mopup the fire near the existing perimeter as well as to provide structure defense if needed is also a priority.</p\n\n<br>\n\n<p><b>Bullfrog Fire Information</b></p>\n<p>The Bullfrog Fire is burning on the Sierra National Forest but is not related to the Creek Fire.

CAL FIRE’s Incident Management Team ordered the National Guard to assist with fire suppression efforts due to resource draw down throughout the state, 125 National Guard personnel are assigned to the incident. The current acreage of the August Complex West Zone is 93,942 acres and is 30% contained. Resources from across the state of California as well as Montana, Idaho, Texas, and New Jersey have been assigned to assist on the August Complex-West Zone. Some evacuation orders and warnings have been reduced. Successful firing operations near Lake Pillsbury today helped eliminate isolated pockets of unburned fuels. In areas experiencing diminished fire behavior further north, firefighters continued mop-up and direct fire attack. Smoke continues to be highly visible due to firing operations, active pockets of fire and multiple areas with smoldering and creeping fire.</p>\n\n<p><b> Evacuation Orders, Evacuation Warnings, and Road Closures:</b></p>\n\n<p><b>Humboldt County</b></p>\n<p>For the latest road closures and evacuation information in Humboldt County please visit: <a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1Y_qCH75uA9ViOP0bao2-Cv07uB3pX3XG&ll=40.209730371490714%2C-123.54374267330414&z=9\">Humboldtgov.org/evacmap</a></p>\n<p><i>Evacuation Order:</i> NONE</p>\n<p><i>Evacuation Warnings:</i>NONE</p>\n\n\n<p><i>Road Closures:</i> All road closures due to the August Complex West Zone Fire have been lifted.

The West Zone is managed by CAL FIRE Incident Management Team 4. The North Complex West Zone is in unified command with CAL FIRE, United States Forest Service, California State Parks, and Butte County Sheriff’s Office.</p>\n<p>The smoke continues to moderate both the temperatures and humidity over the fire area. The winds are consistent with downslope and then down valley winds over night and then shifting upslope and up-valley during the day coming from the south/southwest. The winds that surface are causing erratic fire behavior in the area of the South Fork of the Feather River Drainage where most of the fire activity is taking place in the West Zone. The critically dry fuel moistures make the vegetation very receptive to fire.</p>\n<p>138 soldiers with the California National Guard arrived on Sunday and went out on the fire line yesterday morning to engage in mopping up various areas of the fire, preventing any further fire spread in contained areas.

Throughout\ntoday and overnight the fire will remain active and thermal belts and dry fuels in Central Camp, Gaggs Campground, and Timber Creek will promote fire activity. Elsewhere, the\nmost activity will be around Whisky Falls and towards Timber Butte , progressing and north of Strawberry Mine. Along the eastern edge of the fire in the Bog Cabin to Pine\nFlat are it will be limited by rocky terrain and lighter fuels.</p>\n\n<p>Warm and dry conditions will persist today including terrain driven winds for most of the fire area and southwest winds gusting to twenty-two miles per hour along the ridge top. Relative humidity will drop to fourteen to twenty-four percent with poor recoveries\nin the higher elevations and only moderate recoveries in lower elevations. These conditions can be expected through Friday with warmer weather expected over the\nweekend and into next week. </p>\n\n<p>The priority for the North Zone of the Creek Fire remains the construction and improvement of containment line. Fire spread is being monitored while structures in\nthreatened areas have been prepped for the defense.</p>\n\n<p><b>South Zone:</b></p> \n<p>Areas of the South Zone were active along the South Fork of the San Joaquin River as it progresses south along the solid rock rim of the drainage while on the eastern side of the fire burning is occurring towards the Dinkey Lakes Wilderness. Yesterday’s firing operation will continue to burn out in the Sycamore Creek drainage, as previously\nunburnt fuels become fully consumed, which provides assistance in containment. Around Portal Forebay the fire may move south. </p>\n\n<p>Additional fire progression will be south of Mount Tom but slow as it reaches rocky higher elevation areas with less fuels. Areas with heavier fuels, such as dense beds of\nground fuel and timer, will smolder. </p>\n\n<p>Operational priorities for the South Zone of the Creek Fire remains enhancing containment with improvement of line and completion of the firing operation around\nSycamore Creek. In other areas tactical patrol to mopup the fire near the existing perimeter as well as to provide structure defense if needed is also a priority.</p\n\n<br>\n\n<p><b>Bullfrog Fire Information</b></p>\n<p>The Bullfrog Fire is burning on the Sierra National Forest but is not related to the Creek Fire.
