Cal fire provides annual, historical data for fires in california.

The data was found here:
https://www.fire.ca.gov/media/11397/fires-acres-all-agencies-thru-2018.pdf

That covers all California Fires 1987-2018 for all agencies.
I'll try to backfill 2019 and 2020 from other sources.

Copying from the PDF didn't work, so I converted it to .doc  (https://pdf2doc.com/),
and then copied and pasted into the text file. But the text file
was one number per line, this get_historical_data.py concatenates it back into
its original rows and columns.
